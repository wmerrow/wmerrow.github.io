					<p>Designed as a resource for advocacy organizations focused on U.S. climate policy, this tool will track the number of good and bad climate policy actions by state. A primary challenge with this project was not knowing what the actual data would look like, as the plan was for the client to add data over the course of the year (these images use dummy data). This meant the map and table had to be flexible enough to still be effective regardless of what the data actually looks like.</p>
					<p>The legend adjusts to accommodate the max policy actions per state within the user's selection, and is always the same between the two maps to ensure comparability.</p>

					<p>A square tile map ensures that the policy actions have the same visual weight, regardless of the state's geographic area.</p>
					<p>We began with a single map in mind, but switched to two maps side by side to address cases where states had both positive and negative policy actions.</p>
