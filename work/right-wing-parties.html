					<p>This scrollytelling project began with finding a recently published dataset on political parties in democracies, including their ideologies and attitudes toward democracy. After exploring different data stories, I decided to present an overview of the ideologies of anti-immigration parties in western Europe and the U.S.</p>

					<p>I created the visualizations in D3 and used the graph-scroll.js library to implement a scrollytelling approach. As the user scrolls, the visualization transitions to a new version, and narrative text highlights the main points and provides context.</p>

					<p>To keep users’ attention, I wanted to start with a simple visualization and then add complexity. After identifying the anti-immigration parties, the narrative introduces additional variables one at a time, showing change over time and then positions on the economy and democracy.</p>

					<p>To end, the narrative returns to the overview with all political parties, transitioning to a scatterplot to show how the anti-immigration parties compare with more pro-immigration parties on views on democracy (nearly every anti-democracy party is also anti-immigration).</p>

					<p>The challenge in this project was identifying the data story. I began with a large dataset with many countries and many variables that were interesting.</p>
					<p>I started by looking at existing visualizations of right-wing parties for inspiration and to learn about the subject.</p>

					<p>I then explored the data. Since I wanted to visualize several different variables, I decided to focus on a small number of parties to make it more digestible, so ultimately limited my dataset to the largest countries. I also chose to focus on anti-immigrant parties since immigration is a core part of the platform of right-wing parties, and correlated with anti-democratic views.</p>

					<p>I sketched different visualization approaches before settling on the bubble approach, which worked well for transitioning between different visualizations. I prepared the data in R, which was helpful for experimenting with different groups of countries.</p>
					<p>Future improvements could be to refactor the code and add redrawing on resize, and to update once the dataset reflects Republicans’ anti-democratic behavior around the 2020 election.</p>
