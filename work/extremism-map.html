					<p>The Hate, Extremism, Anti-Semitism, and Terrorism Map (H.E.A.T. Map) shows the location and number of incidents of hate and extremism around the U.S., allowing the user to explore and filter by type of incident and ideology. Balancing client ambitions, data limitations, and a compressed timeline, I designed a map with a focus on facilitating exploration of the data and communicating the gravity of the subject matter.</p>

					<p>I suggested the dark map style given the seriousness of the topic, and designed the visualization color palette to ensure adequate contrast against the base map and also show the relationships among the data. Although the data is categorical, there are relationships among the categories: murders, plots, and shootings (the most serious incidents) use more alarming warm colors, events and propaganda use cool colors, and Anti-Semitic incidents are set apart in light gray.</p>

					<p>The central design question was how to combine several datasets on the same map, while still differentiating by type of incident. This required several rounds of design work in a short period of time. We settled on a layered bubble map approach where bubbles are colored according to the type of incident and sized according to the number of incidents, to ensure users are able to compare different types of incidents. The drawback of this approach is bubbles of the same size stacking and obscuring one another, and the need to explain the edge cases of incidents that fall in multiple categories - compromises in order to meet the goal of displaying differentiated data on the same map.</p>
