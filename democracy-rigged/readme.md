# Visualizing Bias in the U.S. Electoral System

This project shows how different popular vote scenarios translate to outcomes for the presidency, House, and Senate, with the goal of demonstrating how in each of these three institutions, Democrats need to win significantly more than a majority of the popular vote in order to win control. 

For a detailed description of the calculations involved, see the About the Data section. The underlying partisan lean data is from FiveThirtyEight, available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean. 


The page consists of four sections containing graphics and text:
