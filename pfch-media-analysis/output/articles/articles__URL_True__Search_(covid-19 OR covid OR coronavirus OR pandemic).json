    "article_text": "Anti-Vaccine Doctor Has Been Invited to Testify Before Senate Committee WASHINGTON \u2014 A doctor who is skeptical of coronavirus vaccines and promotes the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment will be the lead witness at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, prompting criticism from Democrats who say Republicans should not give a platform to someone who spreads conspiracy theories. Dr. Jane M. Orient is the executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group that opposes government involvement in medicine and views federal vaccine mandates as a violation of human rights. \u201cA public health threat is the rationale for the policy on mandatory vaccines. But how much of a threat is required to justify forcing people to accept government-imposed risks?\u201d Dr. Orient wrote in a statement to the Senate last year, calling vaccine mandates \u201ca serious intrusion into individual liberty, autonomy and parental decisions.\u201d In a phone interview on Sunday, Dr. Orient, an internist who received her medical degree from Columbia University in New York, resisted being cast as an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and said she would not get a coronavirus vaccine because she had an autoimmune condition. She added that she opposed the government\u2019s push for all Americans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, noting that both vaccine candidates \u2014 one made by the Pfizer and the other by Moderna \u2014 use a new scientific method. \u201cIt seems to me reckless to be pushing people to take risks when you don\u2019t know what the risks are,\u201d Dr. Orient said, adding: \u201cPeople\u2019s rights should be respected. Where is \u2018my body, my choice\u2019 when it comes to this?\u201d Her selection as a witness as federal health officials are trying to promote a vaccine as a way to end a pandemic that has killed more than 281,000 Americans prompted harsh criticism from Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. \u201cAt such a crucial time, giving a platform to conspiracy theorists to spread myths and falsehoods about Covid vaccines is downright dangerous and one of the last things Senate Republicans should be doing right now,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement on Sunday. But at least two Republican House members \u2014 Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona and Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina \u2014 appeared to embrace Dr. Orient\u2019s warnings against government mandates. They took to Twitter to express those views. \u201cAmericans should have the freedom to take the COVID vaccine,\u201d Mr. Duncan wrote on Saturday. \u201cAmericans should also have the freedom to decline the vaccine.\u201d A spokesman for the chairman of the Senate committee, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, did not immediately return an email message asking why Dr. Orient had been invited to testify. Federal health officials are trying to enlist lawmakers in a campaign to encourage Americans to accept the new vaccines. An F.D.A. advisory committee will meet on Thursday to review data on the safety and efficacy of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine candidate. If the agency grants the vaccine emergency authorization, rollout could begin shortly after. In a private briefing with a bipartisan group of senators last month, Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration\u2019s vaccine development program, said that \u201cit would help if senators got vaccinated,\u201d according to a person familiar with the call. Dr. Orient, who lives in Tucson, Ariz., said on Sunday that she would appear remotely during the hearing on early at-home treatment for Covid-19. She said in the interview that doctors were too often sending patients home with instructions to simply rest and ride out the disease. The association has also sued the government in an effort to force it to release hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile for use as a Covid-19 treatment, although the scientific evidence indicates that the drug is ineffective against the coronavirus. The case is currently before a federal appeals court. Dr. Orient said she intended to use her testimony to call for government guidelines informing doctors about hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for Covid-19 patients, even though the Food and Drug Administration revoked an emergency authorization allowing the drug to be distributed from the national stockpile and has warned that it could harm those patients. Dr. Orient\u2019s organization has urged people to be cautious about the vaccine in blog posts with titles like \u201cShould We Line Up for a 90% Effective Vaccine?\u201d In her interview, she raised particular concerns about vaccinations for young people \u201cbecause the effect on fertility has not been determined.\u201d There is no evidence that any of the leading coronavirus vaccines affect fertility. Dr. Orient also took aim at Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, asking, \u201cWhy is he dictating care for 340 million Americans?\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump Administration Declines to Tighten Soot Rules, Despite Link to Covid Deaths WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday declined to tighten controls on industrial soot emissions, disregarding an emerging scientific link between dirty air and Covid-19 death rates. In one of the final policy moves of an administration that has spent the past four years weakening or rolling back more than 100 environmental regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency completed a regulation that keeps in place, rather than tightening, rules on tiny, lung-damaging industrial particles, known as PM 2.5, even though the agency\u2019s own scientists have warned of the links between the pollutants and respiratory illness. E.P.A. administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to announce the rule Monday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the matter. Public health experts say that the rule defies scientific research, including the work of the E.P.A.\u2019s own public health experts, which indicates that PM 2.5 pollution contributes to tens of thousands of premature deaths annually, and that even a slight tightening of controls on fine soot could save thousands of American lives. In April, researchers at Harvard released the first nationwide study linking long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and Covid-19 death rates. The study found that a person living for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate matter is 15 percent more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution. The new rule retains a standard enacted in 2012. That rule limited the pollution of industrial fine soot particles \u2014 each about 1/30th the width of a human hair, but associated with heart attacks, strokes and premature deaths \u2014 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. By law, the E.P.A. is required every five years to review the latest science and update that standard. When E.P.A. scientists conducted that mandatory review, many concluded that if the federal government tightened that standard to about nine micrograms per cubic meter, more than 10,000 American lives could be saved a year. In a draft 457-page scientific assessment of the risks associated with keeping or strengthening the fine soot pollution rule, career scientists at the E.P.A. estimated that the current standard is \u201cassociated with 45,000 deaths\u201d annually. The scientists wrote that if the rule were tightened to nine micrograms per cubic meter, annual deaths would fall by about 27 percent, which amounts to 12,150 people a year. After the publication of that report, numerous industries, including oil and coal companies, automakers and chemical manufacturers, urged the Trump administration to disregard the findings and not tighten the rule. In a November 2019 public comment submitted by 13 industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry representatives wrote, \u201csignificant uncertainty remains about the relationship between exposure to PM 2.5 and adverse effects on public health.\u201d The E.P.A.\u2019s leaders agreed with the industries\u2019 assessment. In December last year, a seven-member E.P.A. advisory panel, composed mostly of members appointed by Trump administration, told Mr. Wheeler the career scientists\u2019 findings were not conclusive enough to support tightening the rule. A final version of the scientists\u2019 report, published in January to preview the still-unpublished rule, does say the rule as it stands contributes to 45,000 deaths annually, but it also says only that tightening it would reduce \u201chealth risks,\u201d not deaths.",

    "first_p": "More than one in four workers in the West Farms neighborhood is out of work.",
    "article_text": "\u2018It Makes Me Angry\u2019: These Are the Jobless in a City Filled With Wealth More than one in four workers in the West Farms neighborhood is out of work. They were store clerks, hotel housekeepers, waitresses, cooks, for-hire drivers, security officers and maintenance workers before the coronavirus snatched away their livelihoods. Even before the outbreak, most were barely getting by on meager paychecks and scant savings. Now their hopes for better lives are slipping away as they fall behind on rent, ration food and rack up credit card debt. Unemployment in this poor and largely Latino enclave of 19,000 in the Bronx was in double digits before the outbreak. It has gotten far worse. With an unemployment rate of 26 percent in September, West Farms has become an epicenter of New York\u2019s economic crisis, one of the hardest hit urban communities in the country and emblematic of the pandemic\u2019s uneven toll. Though no corner of the city has escaped the fallout, the mass job losses have been concentrated in mostly Black and Latino pockets outside Manhattan that have long lagged economically behind the rest of the city. Communities like West Farms have also suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus itself, with higher rates of people becoming ill. Meliza Mercedes, 26, was scouring apartment listings before the outbreak, hoping to finally give her 3-year-old daughter, Aubrey, a home of her own. A couple of times, she spotted a nice two-bedroom apartment in the Bronx for under $2,000 a month. Ms. Mercedes, who stays with her mother in West Farms, had saved about $3,000 by living frugally. She rarely went out and almost never bought herself new clothes. But then came the pandemic, which closed nonessential businesses in March. She lost her job as a store detective at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square and her $550 weekly paycheck. Her savings were soon gone, too. \u201cI cry about it because I\u2019ve been trying to get my own place,\u201d she said. Similar stories of hardship and loss are repeated countless times across West Farms. At the corner bodega where neighbors talk about how there is no work and no way to pay the bills. At the local elementary school, Public School 67, which now doubles as a food pantry, giving out 400 grab-and-go meals with sandwiches and fruit every day. Amanda Adedokun, a single mother, lost her babysitting jobs and can no longer support her own children. Eddie Su\u00e1rez is a commercial landlord who built a storefront nearly three decades ago, but with a tenant missing rent payments, he struggles to pay his own bills. And Yalikhan Traore, a West African immigrant who worked in a beauty supply store, had to reinvent herself as a delivery driver to adapt to the new pandemic reality. New York City\u2019s economic crisis is among the worst in the nation, with unemployment at 13.2 percent in October, nearly double the national rate. But within the city, the pain varies vastly. Manhattan\u2019s unemployment rate is 10.3 percent, but in the Bronx, the city\u2019s poorest borough, it is 17.5 percent \u2014 the highest in the state. In West Farms, the unemployment rate soared from 11 percent in February to 38 percent in June, before dropping to 26 percent in September, according to a statistical model developed by two analysts, Yair Ghitza and Mark Steitz. Across the neighborhood, stores have fewer customers and sales. One dry cleaner took out a $75,000 loan to stay in business. A Catholic school that educated children for more than a century closed after many families could no longer afford tuition. In contrast, some of the city\u2019s most affluent and largely white neighborhoods in Manhattan have fared far better. The unemployment rate on the Upper East Side was 5 percent in September, up from 1 percent in February, according to the latest data from the statistical model. On the Upper West Side, it was 6 percent, up from 2 percent. Poor workers, including many Black and Latino people, have been hurt much worse during the pandemic than by past recessions, including the 2008 financial crisis, said James Parrott, an economist with the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School. He said the pandemic had triggered many more layoffs among lower-paid workers, while far fewer higher-paid workers \u2014 including those in finance, technology and professional services, who tend to be mostly white \u2014 have lost jobs or benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s another dimension of the extreme differences in economic well-being in New York,\u201d Mr. Parrott said. West Farms gets its name from the English farmers who settled this area along the Bronx River in the mid-1600s, said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. It later grew into a village with teachers, dressmakers, and grocers, many of whom wanted to escape Manhattan crowding. Factories followed as the river became a bustling industrial waterway. Apartment houses spread across West Farms in the 1900s after a subway station \u2014 the West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue stop on the 2 and 5 lines \u2014 was built. The area was the backdrop for one of the city\u2019s worst tragedies in 1990, when 87 people died in a fire set at the Happy Land Social Club. West Farms lies just south of the Bronx Zoo \u2014 zebras can be spotted from some apartment windows. Today, its long history is reflected in the jumble of tidy single-family homes and rowhouses, squat brick buildings and affordable housing towers. Ms. Mercedes moved to West Farms with her family from a homeless shelter in the Bronx in 2008. The youngest of six children of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, she later dropped out of high school when she was 17. Her first job was store cashier, followed by stints at a storefront tax service and two pharmacies. Ms. Mercedes said she always wanted to work in law enforcement and was thrilled to be hired as a Macy\u2019s security guard in July 2019. She was promoted four months later to store detective. She once spotted four shoplifters in a single day, she recalled, and was bitten or bruised trying to stop some of them. For her efforts, she was recognized as detective of the month. \u201cEverything was going well until the pandemic hit,\u201d she said. So well that Ms. Mercedes allowed herself a few splurges. She got her nails done twice a month, and treated Aubrey to outings at Chuck E. Cheese. They took mother-daughter trips to Target and Dollar Tree, where Aubrey picked out sticker books or a toy from \u201cTrolls,\u201d her favorite movie. The pandemic ended all that. For an older sister\u2019s birthday dinner, Ms. Mercedes could only afford to get the cheapest thing on the menu, fried chicken with rice and beans. \u201cIt was driving me crazy not to go back to work,\u201d said Ms. Mercedes, who did not look for another job because she believed she would return to work at Macy\u2019s. When the store reopened in June, she received an email \u2014 it was addressed \u201cDear colleague\u201d \u2014 that said, \u201cRegretfully, we are unable to continue your employment at this time.\u201d She received a severance check of $1,500. Julie Strider, a Macy\u2019s spokeswoman, declined to comment on Ms. Mercedes, but cited necessary reductions as a result of the pandemic. \u201cThese are always hard decisions to make as they impact many of our valued colleagues,\u201d she said. Ms. Mercedes said she had applied for more than two dozen jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s a very scary situation,\u201d she said. Few in West Farms have a financial safety net. The median annual household income is $23,329, compared with $38,000 in the Bronx, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Citywide, the median income is $61,000, nearly three times higher. Jose Allende starts pounding the sidewalks in West Farms at 7 a.m., hoping to find someone who needs a hand with construction. Mr. Allende wears paint-splattered jeans and boots to show that he is ready to work, though he has gotten few takers. Mr. Allende said he was laid off from his job as a handyman for a nearby residential building just before the pandemic. He also used to supplement his income with handyman gigs in Queens and Brooklyn. But he said he no longer feels safe riding the subway or bus since he has no health insurance or savings and cannot afford to get sick. \u201cI lost sleep trying to think of how to pay the bills,\u201d said Mr. Allende, 50, who moved to West Farms a decade ago from Puerto Rico. In recent years, a construction boom has brought an influx of affordable housing and newcomers to West Farms. About 74 percent of West Farms residents are Latino, and 23 percent Black, according to the census analysis. Mr. Su\u00e1rez, 72, a former elementary schoolteacher from Harlem, has far deeper roots in the neighborhood. He took a chance on West Farms in 1992, when the area was far less safe, and decided to build a no-frills storefront on a vacant lot. Last year, in a sign of the neighborhood\u2019s upswing, he was offered $1 million for the property by an investor, he said, but turned it down. He leased space to a laundromat and a botanica, and in the back, created a youth center. \u201cWe went through a period of rebuilding in the Bronx,\u201d Mr. Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cThings aren\u2019t looking too good right now,\u201d he added. West Farms is part of the 10460 ZIP code, which had a higher rate of confirmed coronavirus cases than the city\u2019s overall rate of 3,276 cases per 100,000 residents in mid-November, according to city data. The Bronx has the highest rates of total coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths of any borough. Mr. Su\u00e1rez said that both businesses in his building are open, but the botanica is struggling and behind on the rent. \u201cAll the businesses in the neighborhood have suffered,\u201d said Mr. Su\u00e1rez, who is himself having a hard time paying bills without the rent money. Another small commercial landlord, Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez, said his tenant, a business service center, left without paying six months of rent, more than $16,000. \u201cEven if the tenants don\u2019t pay, I still have to pay the bank,\u201d said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cSo I drew from my savings and was left with nothing.\u201d Many West Farms landlords and business owners said they are simply trying to hold on. Raymond Cabrera, who owns a dry cleaning store, said he has only a couple of customers a day. \u201cI think they don\u2019t come because they don\u2019t go to work, weddings, church, parties,\u201d he said. Mr. Cabrera, 60, said he used a $75,000 emergency federal loan for small businesses to cover the $2,000 monthly rent for his storefront. Repaying the loan would take 30 years. At El Nuevo Valle 2 Restaurant, the lunch crowd has largely disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a shred of what it used to be like,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Tejada, 55, a waitress in a mask at the counter. A few minutes later, Ms. Tejada wagged her finger at a customer. \u201cYou owe me one dollar, OK? Next time.\u201d \u201cPeople want you to give them food, they say they don\u2019t have the money,\u201d she said. One neighborhood institution did not make it. St. Thomas Aquinas, the local parochial school, closed in July. Parents who lost jobs could no longer afford tuition. And with churches shut down for months because of the pandemic, there were fewer donations, which are used in part to support schools. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to see that a school that made me who I am is closed down now,\u201d said Stephanie Qui\u00f1ones, 34, who attended St. Thomas Aquinas. \u201cTo think that it stayed open over a 100 years, and to close it just like that.\u201d When Ms. Traore was laid off from a beauty supply shop in March, she didn\u2019t even have money to spare for the laundromat. So she started washing her clothes in the bathtub. She pooled her food money with a roommate, and stocked up on rice, beans and eggs from a West African grocery. She could no longer pay her $600 share of the rent. \u201cEverything has a cost in New York,\u201d said Ms. Traore, 35, who immigrated from Guinea three years ago. \u201cIf you have no income, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard, especially if you have no savings.\u201d Ms. Traore learned about unemployment benefits from a friend. She applied right away, but heard nothing for weeks. \u201cI kept checking every day, two or three times,\u201d she said. \u201cI found that was a full-time job calling the unemployment office.\u201d Unemployment benefits have been a lifeline for many West Farms workers. Some earned as much, if not more, than they did at their jobs with the federal pandemic supplement, which added $600 a week to state benefits, and were able to pay bills. But the layoffs overwhelmed New York\u2019s unemployment system. And when the federal supplement ended in July, the remaining state benefit \u2014 capped at $504 a week \u2014 was not enough for most people. Ms. Traore started to panic after weeks of waiting for benefits. She joined a Facebook group where workers had enlisted elected officials for help. She emailed State Senator Luis R. Sepu\u0301lveda, whose district includes West Farms, for assistance. With Mr. Sepu\u0301lveda\u2019s office pushing her case, Ms. Traore\u2019s benefits \u2014 $700 a week after taxes, including the federal supplement \u2014 were approved. Mr. Sepu\u0301lveda has received more than 500 requests for help with unemployment benefits \u2014 so many that his office set up a database to track cases. \u201cIt makes me angry because in the wealthiest city in the world, it\u2019s inexcusable to have such a high rate of unemployment in one area,\u201d Mr. Sepu\u0301lveda said. As the public health crisis eased, New York restarted its economy. Stores and businesses reopened and started calling some of their workers back. Ms. Traore was one of the lucky ones in West Farms. She started in June as a driver delivering packages, benefiting from the surge in online shopping during the pandemic. She earns $17 an hour, or $2 more than her minimum-wage job at the beauty store. Ms. Traore said she liked bringing essential supplies and medications to people who cannot go out. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I can right now to help people,\u201d she said. Ms. Mercedes also has reason to hope. After The New York Times asked Macy\u2019s about her job status, she said the company recently offered her a position at one of its Brooklyn stores. Even as some people in West Farms are finding their footing, many others are not. Ms. Adedokun, 45, used to earn $400 a week babysitting for two families in West Farms before the pandemic. Then one parent began working remotely for a law firm, and another was laid off by a hotel. With no babysitting money, Ms. Adedokun has run up $7,000 in credit card debt. Ms. Adedokun, who lives in a subsidized apartment with her son, 17, and daughter, 8, said they liked to celebrate her daughter\u2019s birthday at a water park. This year, all they could afford was pizza. To make herself feel better, she said, she gets dressed in a blouse and jeans and dabs on makeup just to go sit on a bench outside her apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s helping me mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I stay in and look a mess, I feel like a mess.\u201d Susan Beachy, Jack Begg and Quoctrung Bui contributed research.",

    "article_text": "Scandal Dogs AstraZeneca\u2019s Vaccine Partner in China As a government regulator sidled into a car, the Chinese pharmaceutical executive handed over a paper bag stuffed with $44,000 in cash. The executive, Du Weimin, was eager to get his company\u2019s vaccines approved, and he needed help. The official took the money and vowed to try his best, according to court documents from 2016. Several months later, Mr. Du got the greenlight to begin clinical trials for two vaccines. They were ultimately approved, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. The government official was jailed for taking bribes from Mr. Du and several other vaccine makers. Mr. Du was never charged. Instead, he built an empire. His company, Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products, is one of China\u2019s largest vaccine makers. And Mr. Du, dubbed the \u201cking of vaccines,\u201d is one of the richest men in China. Capitalizing on that success, Mr. Du and his company are now at the forefront of the global race to produce a coronavirus vaccine, a national priority for China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. Kangtai will be the exclusive manufacturer in mainland China for the vaccine made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the companies could work together on deals for other countries. The Chinese company is also in early trials for its own candidate. Mr. Du\u2019s success, against the backdrop of scandal, is not an outlier in China. It is the norm. As the Chinese government has pushed to develop vaccine companies of global renown, the state has fostered and protected an industry plagued by corruption and controversy. Drug companies, eager to get their products into the hands of consumers, have used financial incentives to sway poorly compensated government workers for regulatory approvals. Hundreds of Chinese officials have been accused in recent years of taking bribes in cases involving vaccine companies, according to a review of court records. The companies and executives implicated rarely face punishment. Oversight has been weak, contributing to a spate of scandals over substandard vaccines. While the government after each incident has vowed to do more to clean up the industry, regulators have rarely provided much information about what went wrong. Companies have often emerged unscathed after making an apology or paying a fine, and in nearly all instances, they have been allowed to continue operating. Dr. Ray Yip, a former head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in China, said he considers Kangtai to be among the top tiers of the country\u2019s vaccine companies, adding that he \u201chas no problem\u201d with the manufacturing and technology standards of most players. \u201cThe problem for many of them is their business practice,\u201d said Dr. Yip, who also led the China office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThey all want to sell to the local governments, so they have to do kickbacks, they have to bribe. That\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel of China\u2019s vaccine business.\u201d Kangtai did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a statement, AstraZeneca said it \u201cconducts appropriate and thorough due diligence prior to entering an agreement with any entity.\u201d \u201cSafety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine is of utmost importance, and AstraZeneca has partnered with capable, established organizations to help ensure broad and equitable global access, at no profit during the pandemic,\u201d the company said. The lack of transparency, compounded by dubious business practices, has rattled public confidence in Chinese-made vaccines, even though they have been proved safe. Many well-off parents shun them, preferring their Western counterparts. In 2013, 17 infants died after injections with Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccine. Regulators cleared Kangtai of wrongdoing, and the vaccine continues to be used safely. But the government didn\u2019t provide substantial details about its investigation into the deaths or Kangtai\u2019s safety practices; the company had negative articles retracted. Distraught parents around the world blame vaccine makers for their children\u2019s illnesses or their untimely deaths, often without scientific evidence. But in China, the government muzzles many families, further feeding suspicions about Chinese-made vaccines. Activists who have called for greater scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies, including Kangtai, have been harassed, intimidated and detained. Worried about the threat to social stability, Chinese officials have tried to stop them from organizing, by shuttering social media groups and monitoring their communications. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the 2013 scandal \u201craises legitimate concerns\u201d about Kangtai. \u201cThe stakes are very high,\u201d Dr. Huang said. \u201cImagine if a similar scandal is reported again in China. It\u2019s not just going to undermine the confidence of the company manufacturing the vaccine, it\u2019s also going to hurt the reputation of AstraZeneca itself and their vaccine, too.\u201d As the chief executive of a small vaccine maker in the early 2000s, Mr. Du was looking to grow. He set his sights abroad, visiting pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology research institutes in Western countries, including the United States, Britain and France. Mr. Du, then in his mid-30s, came away from his meetings with an urgent conclusion, he recalled in interviews with Chinese news outlets. It was a mistake for China to continue relying on foreign vaccines, Mr. Du had determined. They were expensive. And he worried that China\u2019s dependence on other countries posed \u201chidden dangers to national security.\u201d \u201cVaccines for the Chinese people must firmly be in the hands of the Chinese,\u201d Mr. Du told a state-owned newspaper, the Jiangxi Daily, in 2014. His timing was good. After years of relying on multinational companies for crucial medicine, the Chinese government wanted to cultivate a homegrown vaccine industry, for many of the same reasons. State-run companies had long dominated the business in China, going back to the Mao era. As demand increased, entrepreneurs like Mr. Du saw an opportunity to build companies that could compete on the global stage. Many embraced partnerships with overseas vaccine makers, a strategy that China followed in other areas like technology and auto manufacturing. The international companies gained access to the Chinese market, while the Chinese companies secured valuable knowledge about production techniques and technology. Such deals would help catapult Mr. Du, the son of farmers from a poor mountainous area of Jiangxi Province, into the big leagues. After helping found Beijing Minhai Biotechnology in 2004, he teamed up with the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur on a rabies vaccine. At the time, the Chinese government was leading a concerted effort to limit the spread of the disease, which killed more than 2,600 people in China that year. In 2008, Mr. Du moved to expand his business by investing in Kangtai. The company was founded in 1992 with help from the American drugmaker Merck. Together, they produced a hepatitis B vaccine, as part of a joint venture aimed at improving health standards in China. His dealmaking would create an industry giant. Local media called him \u201cthe warrior of the vaccine kingdom.\u201d His net worth was an estimated $7.4 billion until May, when Mr. Du transferred $3.5 billion worth of shares in his company to his ex-wife, Yuan Liping, in what Chinese news outlets described as China\u2019s most expensive divorce ever. Ms. Yuan, a Canadian citizen, is now one of Canada\u2019s richest women. \u201cFrom starting his company to getting rich to getting divorced,\u201d China Times, a mainland news site, wrote about the tycoon, \u201cthe mysteries that he holds can only be solved with time.\u201d The timing seemed suspicious. In 2010, the state-run China Youth Daily newspaper reported that regulators had delayed telling the public that about 180,000 doses of a rabies vaccine were ineffective. The vaccine was made by Jiangsu Yanshen, then owned by Mr. Du of Kangtai. During the delay, which lasted nine months, Mr. Du sold a roughly 51 percent stake in the company to the Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, another drug manufacturer, according to the Economic Observer website, a financial news outlet. An investigative journalist, Du Taoxin, started digging. Industry insiders, he said, confirmed the reports, telling him that regulators held off on the announcement so that Du Weimin could sell the shares and not be held liable for the scandal. It lined up with a report in the state-backed China National Radio. The article similarly named Mr. Du and found that the authorities had withheld the information so that Simcere would have to bear the reputational costs of the scandal. After reports of the faulty vaccines, Simcere issued a statement saying that the quality issues occurred before it invested in Jiangsu Yanshen, emphasizing that it bore \u201cno responsibility for the incident.\u201d Mr. Du, the pharmaceutical executive, would not comment. In August 2014, the journalist published his article under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s Drug Regulators Caught Up in \u2018Whistleblowing Scandals,\u2019 Unveiling the Truth Behind Vaccine Cases.\u201d Many of the industry\u2019s problems are born out of a symbiotic relationship with the government. China\u2019s vaccines are administered through local communicable disease control centers. Those centers take a cut of the profit for certain types of vaccines, creating an incentive for corruption. From 2018 to 2020, there were 59 corruption lawsuits involving vaccine companies, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Fifty-four of them involved bribing local officials. Kangtai sued the journalist, Du Taoxin, and his newspaper, Democracy and the Rule of Law, claiming defamation. The journalist and his newspaper tried to defend the work, submitting what they viewed as other evidence of media pressure. Guangdong Satellite, a state-backed television station, had apologized in September 2014 for \u201churting the feelings\u201d of Mr. Du Weimin after a prominent Chinese economist criticized the tycoon\u2019s company in a program. The station retracted its story. The 21st Century Business Herald, an influential business newspaper, had deleted seven articles that it published relating to Mr. Du\u2019s company and the deaths of newborns who were given Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccines in 2013, according to court documents. They had closely covered several of the deaths and reported that Mr. Du\u2019s family had previously immigrated to Canada. As part of his defense, the journalist noted the article by China National Radio on the same topic. It\u2019s unclear why those media outlets didn\u2019t face legal action. The vaccine tycoon was represented by Zhang He. Mr. Zhang had also served as the lawyer for Yin Hongzhang, the drug regulator who was convicted of accepting bribes from Mr. Du. The journalist pointed to the bribery case as proof he had not defamed the executive in his article. Du Weimin acknowledged, in court documents, that he was the Mr. Du who had bribed Mr. Yin. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But the judge said that information was not pertinent to the case. The judge, in forming his ruling, also cited the journalist\u2019s refusal to disclose the identities of his anonymous sources. On November 2016, Du Taoxin was convicted of \u201churting the reputation\u201d of Du Weimin. The court said Mr. Du\u2019s articles had \u201cled to a decline in the society\u2019s evaluation of Du Weimin and infringed on his reputation.\u201d He had to pay Mr. Du $300, and his newspaper had to delete the article. The sentence was meted out on Chinese Journalists\u2019 Day. Mr. Du quit journalism a year later. \u201cVaccines seem to be an untouchable issue,\u201d said Mr. Du. \u201cNo matter how I persisted in chasing the truth, it always seemed elusive. I had all the evidence, but I knew that this was a lawsuit that could never be won.\u201d A group of Chinese families have led a small but spirited effort in recent years to regulate the nation\u2019s vaccine industry more strictly. The government, which views political organizing as a threat to the Communist Party, has sought to silence their campaign. Officials have harassed and detained mothers, fathers and grandmothers, charging them with \u201cdisrupting public order\u201d or \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble.\u201d In October, the authorities in the central province of Henan detained He Fangmei, one of the most outspoken critics of Chinese vaccine companies in China, according to her friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the legal sensitivity. Lawyers representing vaccine activists have faced severe punishments. Many of the online groups families use to share grievances and coordinate protests on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat have been shut down. Liao Fangsheng tried to petition the central government after his son, Pengyong, was found to have viral encephalitis. Mr. Liao said his son was a happy and healthy 18-month-old before he took a vaccine made by Kangtai. Two or three days after the inoculation, Pengyong developed a low-grade fever and then fell into a coma for 17 days. In December 2019, the local health commission said it was a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that the boy had become ill after taking the vaccine. Mr. Liao didn\u2019t have any scientific evidence, but he remained convinced that the vaccine was connected. He traveled to Beijing to the National Health Commission and the petition bureau, where people go to seek help for their grievances. They directed him to other government departments, what he described as \u201cbuck-passing.\u201d After he tried to seek help outside the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound, he was detained for a week in his hometown in southeastern Jiangxi Province. The authorities said he was \u201cdisrupting the order of a workplace,\u201d according to a copy of the detention notice. \u201cThey all wear one pair of trousers, their superiors protect their subordinates,\u201d said Mr. Liao. \u201cNo one looks at any of the materials I hand over. There is no space for me to talk. Where do you think the law is? Where is the government?\u201d The Chinese government may have reason to shield the industry from criticism. In a country of 1.4 billion people, rumors can quickly spread, undermining China\u2019s effort to protect the health of the nation. But the dearth of information and lack of legal recourse can also breed a deep distrust. In 2010, dozens of elementary school students from southern Guangdong Province experienced headaches, vomiting and limb weakness after they were injected with Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccine. A provincial health official attributed the problems to a \u201cmass-based psychogenic reaction,\u201d according to the state-run China News Service. The official, Peng Guowen, director of the institute of immunization of the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that most of the symptoms such as dizziness or abdominal pain were \u201csubjective\u201d and that none of the students developed fever. He blamed rumors that had spread among the news media and society about the safety of vaccines, saying they had \u201caggravated\u201d the students\u2019 anxiety and caused the vomiting. In a separate news conference, a reporter asked how the government could conclude that the students\u2019 adverse reactions had nothing to do with the vaccine before the test results were out. Officials did not answer, according to The Southern Metropolis Daily. In 2013, after reports emerged that 17 infants had died after they took the same vaccine, the Chinese media and the public called Mr. Du a \u201cbaby-killer.\u201d The government stopped the sale of the vaccines in December for over a month. It lifted the suspension after it concluded that the company was not to blame. The release about the official investigation provided little detail. It mainly took note of the deaths and listed their causes, which included pneumonia, heart disease and diarrhea, according to a government statement. China has been less forthcoming about questions of vaccine safety than other countries. In the United States, the federal government often commissions in-depth assessments after manufacturers report problems with vaccines. In South Korea, where a string of deaths recently undermined confidence in a flu vaccine, the government released detailed data on the deaths as it worked to restore public trust. As China now tries to burnish its global standing as a scientific and medical power, the reputation of its vaccine makers is all the more important. For decades, the industry has focused on selling products in China, believing that the domestic market was big enough to sustain the business. Few companies have discovered products with worldwide impact. Only five Chinese vaccines have been preapproved for export by the World Health Organization. By contrast, India has 47 vaccines that have passed those requirements. To China, the pandemic offers a chance to transform the industry into a global player \u2014 and it\u2019s investing heavily in champions like Kangtai. The local government in the southern city of Shenzhen gave the company a 20,000-square-meter piece of land, which is now the base for Kangtai\u2019s coronavirus vaccine plant. Kangtai has also received government funding as part of the country\u2019s effort to fight the pandemic. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced late last month that their vaccine appeared effective, although the level of effectiveness is disputed. Under the deal with AstraZeneca, Kangtai will produce 200 million doses for mainland China. In late September, Kangtai announced that it would start testing its own coronavirus vaccine on people in China after results showed that it protected mice and monkeys. In an interview with China Central Television, the state broadcaster, Zheng Haifa, a top scientist at Kangtai, said the company was working to achieve a breakthrough in developing a vaccine \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to meet the demands of China\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, who has called on the nation\u2019s pharmaceutical companies to lead an all-out effort to produce a vaccine. Mr. Zheng said the company\u2019s mission was simple: \u201cto provide safe and effective protection for the lives and health of people.\u201d Katie Thomas contributed reporting.

    "article_text": "Indian Farmers\u2019 Protests Spread, in Challenge to Modi NEW DELHI \u2014 Before India\u2019s farmers rose up in anger, presenting an increasingly difficult challenge to a government already grappling with the coronavirus outbreak and a devastating economic slump, Devinder Singh set his field on fire. Mr. Singh would have preferred to clear his rice field. A 41-year-old farmer in the parched region of Punjab, he knew that setting piles of field waste on fire after harvest contributes to the pollution that often chokes New Delhi and the rest of northern India. But he is one of thousands of farmers in an increasingly nationwide pushback against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s proposal to overhaul the way many of the country\u2019s 146 million farms do business. Mr. Modi has said that his market-oriented reform would free them from the constraints of a state-run system. Many Indian farmers believe the overhaul will lead to lower prices and pave the way for corporate takeovers of their small farms, which average less than three acres in size. Farmer protests that began choking the roads to New Delhi last week have spread, intensifying pressure on Mr. Modi\u2019s government to strike a deal. Mr. Singh, who joined the protests outside New Delhi, was also incensed by a new, pollution-focused government ordinance prescribing prison, a fine of up to 10 million rupees (about $135,000) or both for burning crop residue. So last month, when it came time to clear his field for the winter wheat season, he burned the rice straw instead. \u201cMost of the farmers, we have tried not to burn, but we wanted to show our resentment,\u201d said Mr. Singh, who works a 17-acre farm in the Firozpur district of Punjab. \u201cIf you impose on us, we will burn it.\u201d Their defiance may be worsening problems in New Delhi. Deaths from the coronavirus are rising as the Indian capital grapples with a third wave of infections, exacerbated by worsening air pollution. Some experts say fires from angry farmers are contributing to the pollution. The government disputes the theory. The two sides are set to resume talks on Saturday. While officials have said they will not give in and repeal the laws, they could compromise on one of the farmers\u2019 demands: enshrining minimum prices for some crops into law. In the meantime, the protests have spread beyond New Delhi. Farmers marched and waved banners in the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and in the northeastern state of Assam. Sugar cane farmers in Uttar Pradesh, who would be less affected by the farm overhaul, set up a protest camp in solidarity, clogging a central artery on the state\u2019s border with Delhi. India\u2019s foreign ministry summoned Canadian diplomats on Friday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced concern for the farmers during a Facebook Live session. The ministry said the comments constituted \u201cunacceptable interference\u201d and risked damaging ties between the two nations. Mr. Modi\u2019s government faced similarly widespread protests late last year after it enacted an anti-Muslim naturalization law. But these demonstrations present a trickier challenge. Farmers represent a powerful political constituency for Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party. Farmers could also be important for bringing India out of its debilitating, coronavirus-driven recession. Agriculture has been a rare bright spot, with farmers continuing to purchase consumer goods and offering income for people who lost their jobs after Mr. Modi locked down the country to stop the pandemic earlier this year. Outside New Delhi, protesters were settling in for a long wait. At the village of Singhu, on the border between the territory of Delhi and the state of Haryana, protesters blocked several miles of highway. On a recent visit, they were cooking and serving food on long mats, spread on the ground in the style of Sikh temple kitchens, and sleeping on hay in tractor-trailers covered with canvas tarps. An armed barricade blocked the road to New Delhi. Harjinder Singh, a wheat and cotton farmer in Gujarat, Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, traveled more than 600 miles to join the protest. He said that farming had become untenable in Gujarat because farmers had no access to a state-run market that subsidizes their crops. \u201cI\u2019ve got 100 acres there,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I\u2019ve turned it into barren land because of the government\u2019s rude policies.\u201d Angry farmers could make their worries felt beyond the protests. After enjoying some of its cleanest air in memory during the lockdown, New Delhi has recorded day after day of catastrophically bad air. Pollution in the capital surges near the end of every year, as cold winds sweep down from the Himalayas and people try to keep warm, but the elevated levels amid the outbreak have prompted questions. Farmers traditionally play a role in the annual pollution. Many set fire to large swaths of land to clear fields ahead of the winter wheat sowing season, a practice known as stubble burning. Farm fires have been estimated to contribute between 2 and 40 percent of Delhi\u2019s air pollution during the period. Experts say this year\u2019s pollution levels could be blamed in part on displaced laborers returning to farms, resulting in more cultivating. Satellite data has registered the worst farm fires in four years. \u201cFarm production is at a record level,\u201d said Panwar Sudhir, a life sciences professor of zoology at the University of Lucknow who follows farming issues. But Mr. Sudhir and other experts said farmers may be ignoring official threats and inducements to curb stubble burning as a way to protest. State authorities have long worked to discourage the practice, including offering the use of stubble-clearing tractors and paying farmers not to burn. \u201cWhat farmers were saying was if we are protesting, and you don\u2019t listen to us, then we will burn the stubble,\u201d said Ramandeep Singh Mann, an engineer turned farmers\u2019 activist in Punjab. Government officials dispute the idea of a direct connection. \u201cThe farming laws have nothing to do with this pollution impact,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, India\u2019s minister for the environment, adding that farmers will stop burning when they have a less costly alternative \u2014 a goal that the government wants to help them find. \u201cThere will be more solutions in the offing,\u201d he said. Whatever the cause, the rise in pollution has been deadly as the coronavirus has made its way through New Delhi. Delhi has witnessed record daily infection numbers and its highest death toll since the pandemic began, registering 2,612 deaths in November. \u201cPollution and cold waves worked like splashing petrol on the burning building,\u201d said Dr. Nikhil Modi, a pulmonologist at Apollo hospital in New Delhi. The pollution makes it harder for coronavirus victims, like Ritesh Agrawal\u2019s diabetic mother, to breathe. Last month, after she said she was struggling to breathe, Mr. Agrawal immediately took her to be tested for Covid-19. She tested positive, and doctors advised home isolation. But within hours of returning home, her oxygen levels plummeted. Mr. Agrawal, a 41-year-old businessman in Delhi, said his mother died after being turned away from one hospital after another. \u201cI have money and connections,\u201d Mr. Agrawal said. \u201cBut even that did not help.\u201d The Indian government has made fixing New Delhi\u2019s pollution a priority. Mr. Javadekar said that the government has purchased a fleet of electric buses, expanded metro rail service and imposed steeper emission standards on personal cars. It has also pushed sooty refinery work outside the city limits. It monitors pollution levels from more than 3,000 industrial plants and notifies plant managers by text message when emissions exceed federal limits. At the camp in Singhu, many of the farmers said they had no choice but to burn their waste. Many of the farmers from Punjab are Sikhs. For hundreds of years, males in that community have used the surname Singh to show their common bond. That community is under threat, said Navdeep Singh, 30, a seventh-generation farmer from Amritsar in Punjab. Times are hard, he said, and government efforts like making tractors available are ultimately still too expensive. \u201cWe are forced to burn,\u201d Mr. Singh said, as he shelled peas for one of the demonstration camp\u2019s free kitchens. \u201cThe government hasn\u2019t really helped us with any other way to dispose of it.\u201d Karan Deep Singh and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "How a Home Health Aide Spends Her Sundays Keisha Gourdet has worked as a certified caregiver for Royal Care, a home care agency, for six years. \u201cNot everyone can do this,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people have quit and resigned since the virus started.\u201d But as the pandemic threatens the city with a second wave and the mayor is advising at-risk New Yorkers to limit activities outside the home, Ms. Gourdet remains committed. \u201cMy patients need my help. I would feel I\u2019m neglecting them if I didn\u2019t show up.\u201d Ms. Gourdet, 44, lives in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, on the top floor of a two-family house with her husband, Handal, 45, an M.T.A. bus operator, and two of their three children; Precious, 17, and Simara, 16. Her son, Kadeem, 20, is in the Navy in California. Ms. Gourdet\u2019s work routine is especially grueling on Sundays. HEALTH FIRST I have a rough start; I\u2019m up at 4 a.m. I shower, dress and make sure to have a healthy breakfast of oatmeal, fruit, orange juice and daily supplements. I want a strong immune system. I leave the house wearing two masks and gloves, with a P.P.E. suit, extra gloves, shield mask and can of Lysol in my bag. COMMUTE I catch the 5:45 bus and take that to my patient\u2019s home. The bus makes me nervous because it\u2019s so dirty. I spray myself and the seat because it\u2019s really important I don\u2019t pick up anything. NO HUGS My patient lives in Brooklyn, and I\u2019m there by 6:30. I put on new gloves, spray myself and get into my uniform before walking in. I\u2019ve been coming here several days a week for three years. He\u2019s really nice with a good sense of humor. He\u2019s 53 and a diabetic. Five years ago he fell, and a car hit him. It gave him balance issues, and now he walks with a cane. He\u2019s one of three patients I take care of. I used to hug him hello, which I can\u2019t do anymore because that\u2019s dangerous. We both feel badly, like something has been taken away. MORNING TASKS At 7 I set up his breakfast, then get him ready for his shower. I help him brush his teeth, get dressed and ready for the day. Then he has cereal, eggs, bread and fruit. At 7:45 he watches the news. He\u2019s in the bedroom and I\u2019m by the dining room so that we\u2019re social distancing. At 8:30 we take a short 15-minute walk so he can get some air and exercise. COOK, CLEAN For the next few hours I cook for him; vegetables, rice, peas and beans. I do his grocery shopping on Saturday. Everything is only a block away so that\u2019s good. Then I clean the whole apartment. I don\u2019t want him to get sick so I make sure everything is sanitized. Everything right now feels really stressed. A GOOD PLACE Over the years he has become like family. In the beginning it was rocky. He didn\u2019t want anyone telling him what to do. Now we\u2019re at a good place. Since we can\u2019t touch, we high-five with gloved hands. Then I say, \u2018Don\u2019t be a stranger; if anything happens call me.\u2019 I don\u2019t want him to feel left alone because I know he gets depressed when I leave. SHOWER AND SANDWICH 11 a.m. is the end of my shift. In the hallway I spray myself, get out of the uniform and put it in a plastic bag. I throw out the masks and gloves and put on a new set. I get back on the bus and spray everything. I race home; I only have 45 minutes, so I take off my clothing by the front door, run upstairs, shower using Dettol, an antibacterial liquid soap, and get dressed. My husband has already left for work. My daughters are home. I say a quick hello and tell them I love them. I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and drink a glass of milk and then I leave. IN TRANSIT, AGAIN At 12:30 I catch another bus, which I take to Church Street. Then it\u2019s two subways to my next job, which is at a nursing home in Queens. I look for empty cars and get in the one with the least people. There\u2019s so much back and forth. I don\u2019t have a rest period, it\u2019s overwhelming. THE AFTERNOON GIG I\u2019m at the Midway Nursing Home by 2:20ish. Everything is sanitized again. I take my temperature to make sure I don\u2019t have a fever. I sign in and am given new masks, gloves and protective gear. There are seven floors. One is for those who have the virus. One is for people getting over it. The others are for rehab, long-term stays or my floor, which is for the elderly who have dementia. MULTIPLE PATIENTS I have 10 patients, and I say hi to each one. Some are happy to see me; some are in bad moods. For the next several hours I run around attending to everyone. I do check-ins, find out who needs a shower, who is getting what for dinner and make sure everyone gets dressed for bed. The staff on my floor are really nice. Everyone is there to help. It\u2019s the only way to function well. BEDTIME At 9 everyone gets a snack: Jell-O, banana, yogurt or ice cream. Bedtime is at 9:30. After I put everyone to bed, I do computer work for the next 90 minutes and log in who got a shower and who ate what. EXHAUSTED At 11 I clock out, take off my P.P.E. suit and face shield. I throw out the gloves and mask and put new ones on and walk to the train. Only a few are running, so it can be a 20-minute wait, which is horrible because I\u2019m so tired. It\u2019s one of the worst parts because I just want to go home and see my husband. I wait for the second train, then the bus. Everything is sprayed. I\u2019m exhausted. TEA I get home at 1:15 a.m. and shower again. I have a hot cup of lemon zinger tea and go to bed. My husband is already asleep. It\u2019s hard not to see him. We\u2019ve both picked up extra shifts since the virus started. It\u2019s been very tough, but we\u2019re going to get through this.",

Sadly, there is no \u201cright\u201d way to cope with grief.

Now, it won\u2019t take long to learn that some people and places are better for sharing feelings than others. \u201cHow are you?\u201d asked in passing at the beginning of a Zoom meeting is qualitatively different than during a leisurely walk. Personal closeness counts too. But don\u2019t discount strangers entirely. One of the best talks I had after my father died was with a man I\u2019d never met on a Fifth Avenue bus. You will make your own path. Over time, you may feel less urgency in speaking of your aunt. But until then, be generous with yourself. An important person has left this world. Her loss and meaning in your life are important questions to consider. My mother lives in a senior-living apartment building. Residents can buy a meal plan or cook for themselves. The woman who lives beneath my mother cooks, and her cooking odors come directly into my mother\u2019s apartment. My mother opens windows and turns on a special fan provided by management, but the smells persist. It doesn\u2019t help that the woman cooks at 8 p.m., later than normal dinnertime. We realize this woman has every right to eat when she wants to, but shouldn\u2019t management speak to her about ventilation in her apartment? Or maybe my mother should speak to the woman directly? JUDY Listen, I get feeling protective of an older parent. But I\u2019m also wary of unduly burdening the woman downstairs. She has a right to sustenance (even at the scandalous hour of 8 p.m.). And the responsibility for properly ventilating apartments falls squarely on the shoulders of building management. Don\u2019t let up on them! The building should hire a mechanical engineer to solve this issue or move your mother to another unit. The woman downstairs may be asked for reasonable access to her apartment to fix the problem. But she has a right to cook and enjoy her unit, and it\u2019s not fair to expect her to correct the building\u2019s mechanical problems. I have a friend with whom I interact socially and professionally. In direct communication, he\u2019s lovely. But his social media presence is toxic. He is quite far to the left, which is fine, but I\u2019m tired of how vicious he is to anyone who disagrees with him. Our field operates on social media, so I can\u2019t abandon the platform. Should I mute him or talk to him about his cursing and name-calling? ANONYMOUS The easy thing, of course, is to mute him and move along. But if he\u2019s truly a friend, I think you have a duty to speak up. A few tips: Call him, no typed messages. And start with a positive statement: \u201cI really value our friendship.\u201d Then make your constructive criticism: \u201cIt upsets me to see you attack people on social media. It\u2019s your right to express yourself, but I don\u2019t think it reflects what a kind person you are. Maybe think about it?\u201d Then listen. He may be defensive at first, then soften after time for reflection. My brother married in May. But he only told me months later when I visited him for his birthday. His excuse was that Covid would have made it impossible for me to attend. He still could have told me! He called me yesterday for the first time since I learned the news. I was upset, so my responses were curt; he hung up on me. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do next? NANCE Why not take your brother at his word? He decided it would be frustrating for you to know about the wedding and be unable to attend. And he waited to tell you until he could do it in person. (I buy it.) I also get that you don\u2019t like it. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to discuss how you\u2019d prefer to handle news in the future than feud about possibly good-faith mistakes in the past?

    "article_text": "All Santa Wants for Christmas Is to Stay Out of Politics Ric Erwin is one of thousands of men for whom Santa Claus is both a sacred idea and a seasonal occupation. Earlier this year, he was looking forward to donning his red velvet suit and hat this December, just as he has each winter for the last decade. But the pandemic has thrown a wrench in the usual Christmas shows and shopping mall photo ops. And Mr. Erwin, 62, who is the chairman of the board of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas \u2014 a national association for men who grow and maintain their own beards to play Santa Claus at holiday events \u2014 has found himself advocating for 500 professionals to safely support their work while virus cases are surging. [How Santas in New York are staying safe this year.] In September, Mr. Erwin, who lives in Hemet, Calif., testified virtually before the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. He noted that the production and distribution of an H1N1 vaccine in 2009 allowed Santa Claus performers to save Christmas that year. He hoped the C.D.C. could similarly expedite a vaccine in time for this holiday season. After his testimony, Mr. Erwin received several phone calls, voicemails and emails from Michael R. Caputo, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, who hoped to broker a deal with the Santas. Mr. Erwin recalled Mr. Caputo telling him that the White House was interested in having Santas participate in a 35-city rollout campaign for Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. In exchange, he promised the Santas access to a vaccine by mid-October. \u201cThat sounded like a great deal to us,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. \u201cWithin 24 hours we had over 100 volunteers. The response was overwhelming.\u201d Mr. Caputo told Mr. Erwin he couldn\u2019t wait to tell President Trump that the Santas were onboard with the plan. Then, Mr. Erwin said, Mr. Caputo, the C.D.C. and the H.H.S. ghosted him. Mr. Erwin realized Mr. Caputo was never going to call him back when The Wall Street Journal published an article in late October stating that the campaign, which was meant to include not only Santa players but also celebrities, had been scrapped. (In a statement to The New York Times, an H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated: \u201cThis collaboration will not be happening.\u201d) \u201cWe saw the handwriting on the wall and we knew there was not going to be a collaboration at that point, so if we were going to save Christmas this year it was just going to be the Clauses,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. In addition to stoking some false hope, his negotiations with the federal government drew attention to the myriad societies Santa Claus performers belong to today (though the word \u201cperformers\u201d is scorned by those who take a method approach to the role). There are regional groups (like the Lone Star Santas and the New England Santa Society), as well as national and international ones. For the most part, these organizations try to stay out of politics, activism and other kinds of campaigning. So some Santas were annoyed. \u201cFirst of all, Santa lives in the North Pole \u2014 he doesn\u2019t live in the United States,\u201d said Stephen Arnold, 70, a Memphis resident and president of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas (I.B.R.B.S.), a trade group with more than 2,000 members. \u201cHe might have an interest in seeing that the United States is a calm and safe place for him to visit and deliver Christmas presents, but as a Santa Claus, you shouldn\u2019t have a political posture.\u201d Mr. Arnold added that his understanding was that only four or five people would end up eligible for an early shot of the vaccine according to the offer Mr. Caputo made to Mr. Erwin. To be fair, Mr. Arnold and Mr. Erwin have some history. The Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (F.O.R.B.S.) emerged out of the dissolution more than a decade ago of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (A.O.R.B.S.), which was wrapped in scandal at the time. (\u201cIf you Google \u2018Santa Wars,\u2019 you\u2019ll find articles on it,\u201d Mr. Arnold said.) Today, F.O.R.B.S. is much smaller than I.B.R.B.S., which also includes Mrs. Clauses, and there are members of each group who will not forget the Santa tension of years past. Personal matters aside, Mr. Arnold said his resistance to take part in the government campaign revolved largely around a desire to remain apolitical. \u201cMost of our members were reluctant to consider being first in line because they felt that the whole thing on vaccines was being politically manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work very hard on not being political. We do not allow any political posts or anything on our Facebook group pages.\u201d \u201cIf somebody posts something that\u2019s even slightly interpreted as a political statement, it\u2019s gone instantly,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just deleted.\u201d Should a member like to make a statement out-of-character, that\u2019s fine, Mr. Arnold said. \u201cWe encourage all of our Santas who want to make political posts to create a separate page where they don\u2019t wear any red, and don\u2019t indicate they\u2019re Santa Claus or have Santa in their names,\u201d he said. At this point, according to C.D.C. recommendations, Santa players shouldn\u2019t expect to be vaccinated before Christmas. So, what does that mean for this holiday season? \u201cGenerally speaking, within the Santa community, we are being as cautious as possible,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cThere\u2019s a small contingency of people who have laughed it off and said \u2018I\u2019m going to go on normally, I won\u2019t be performing with a mask.\u2019\u201d Most members of Santa organizations, however, are considered high-risk coronavirus candidates: They are retirees in their 70s and 80s and many have underlying health conditions, Mr. Erwin said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a group of people that are more compromised than the Christmas Committee,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cA lot of us are old and have diabetes. Most of us have a heart problem, most of us are obese. We check every box.\u201d While many Santa-related innovations have come out of 2020 \u2014 holiday-themed masks, plexiglass and acrylic walls that can be made to look invisible in photos, video calls, drive-through greetings \u2014 Mr. Erwin is most enticed by the idea of placing Santa in a vinyl dome. The dome provides physical separation, but it can also be explained with a clever story for the children to understand, Mr. Erwin said. \u201cIf parents don\u2019t want to explain virus transmission, they can say Santa got trapped in a snow globe by an elf magician and you have to come visit him at the globe,\u201d he said. But Mr. Erwin won\u2019t be scheduling any in-person visits this year. His father-in-law suffered a stroke in April and was hospitalized for 30 days before he died; none of his family members were able to visit because of the pandemic. Mr. Erwin told his wife and his mother-in-law, who makes Santa costumes and goes by Mother Claus, that he would not take any chances with the virus. \u201cI don\u2019t even care about giving up my season,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the 150,000 plus people that did not have to die.\u201d He blames the rising toll on the current administration and plans to deliver fitting gifts to its members this Christmas. \u201cAs a Santa, I am neutral and love everybody, but as a citizen I have to say something,\u201d Mr. Erwin said, adding that he would not be giving politicians coal. \u201cThey are getting dryer lint, at best.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Even in a Pandemic, Fine Jewelry Is Selling CORONA DEL MAR, CALIF. \u2014 Conventional wisdom suggests that a pandemic would not bode well for jewelry sales. But for Mark Patterson, a fine jewelry designer with a retail store in this coastal Southern California enclave, 2020 has defied expectations at every turn. (And he\u2019s not alone.) \u201cWholesale is down \u2014 we haven\u2019t done any trunk shows \u2014 but our retail store has doubled sales from last year,\u201d Mr. Patterson said in late October. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. We don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d Actually, he did. \u201cBig diamonds,\u201d he said. Mr. Patterson described a recent sale to a local couple: \u201cThey had plans to travel for their 20th anniversary \u2014 Europe or maybe Australia \u2014 and their trip was canceled due to Covid, so they decided to upgrade her diamond engagement ring from one carat to four carats,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cThey spent close to $55,000.\u201d For the first time, jewelers are enjoying a holiday season unburdened by competition from their No. 1 rival, travel. It\u2019s one way to explain the category\u2019s unexpected resilience during a year of crisis. But it\u2019s not the only one. \u201cPeople are realizing, \u2018Wow, life is short, why don\u2019t we get married?\u2019\u201d said Edahn Golan, a diamond and jewelry industry analyst based in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s all about love, emotions, the fragility of life.\u201d Mr. Golan said that, in the United States, retail jewelry sales in March and April fell by $3.8 billion compared with the same period in 2019 \u2014 retail stores there were closed in these early days of the pandemic. Once lockdowns eased in June, July and August, however, sales for that period grew by $1 billion year over year. Engagement ring sales led the charge, he said. Couples who tied the knot this year cut down on \u201cguests, food, flowers, party favors,\u201d Mr. Golan said. \u201cThe one area where there\u2019s the least tendency to compromise is on the bride\u2019s jewelry because it\u2019s long-lasting, and \u2018I gave up on everything else, why should I give up on this?\u2019\u201d If the crisis has spurred people with means to buy jewelry as an expression of love, it\u2019s inspired those with even greater means to look at it through an age-old lens: as a tangible form of wealth. Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of Sotheby\u2019s jewelry department, saw that at the house\u2019s Magnificent Jewels sale in Geneva last month, where the 14.83-carat Spirit of the Rose, a fancy vivid purple-pink diamond, sold for $26.6 million, making it the most valuable jewel auctioned in 2020. \u201cPeople are looking for hard assets,\u201d Mr. Schuler said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it in these and other categories we sell at Sotheby\u2019s: contemporary art, old master paintings.\u201d All of these factors help explain why sales of fine jewelry, pieces priced at less than $50,000, have performed better than most luxury categories, said Luca Solca, senior research analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein. \u201cThe only caveat is high jewelry, which has suffered from the lack of opportunities to present products to potential customers (normally, brands would piggyback on couture shows in Paris) and, equally, lack of gala occasions to wear those products,\u201d Mr. Solca wrote in an email. At Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont, the Swiss luxury group that owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, the results for the six months ended Sept. 30 bear out Mr. Solca\u2019s larger point: Jewelry sales in the second quarter grew by 4 percent at actual exchange rates compared with the prior year. In a note accompanying the results, Johann Rupert, Richemont\u2019s chairman, attributed the category\u2019s resilience to \u201csuccessful digital initiatives and the continued appeal of iconic collections,\u201d including Clash de Cartier and Perl\u00e9e at Van Cleef & Arpels. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Poulit-Duquesne, chief executive of the luxury jeweler Boucheron, said engagement ring shoppers figured into what she called the \u201csurprising\u201d traffic at the house\u2019s Place Vend\u00f4me boutique in Paris immediately following France\u2019s first lockdown in May. \u201cI am optimistic as we have seen consumption return rapidly in China and Asian countries, where our clients currently can\u2019t travel to Europe but keep investing in jewelry locally,\u201d Ms. Poulit-Duquesne wrote in an email. She added that Boucheron, which is owned by Kering, would soon introduce an e-commerce website. \u201cDistance selling and e-commerce were already in the pipeline and are now more than ever a priority,\u201d Ms. Poulit-Duquesne wrote. \u201cThis crisis reconfirmed the fact that clients are easily buying jewelry online.\u201d That may be the understatement of the decade. In the United States during the peak lockdown months of March and April, the fashion e-tailer Moda Operandi saw fine jewelry sales grow by 35 percent over the same period in 2019. Lauren Santo Domingo, the company\u2019s founder, offered a few theories for the increase: clients in lockdown reallocating their budgets from ready-to-wear styles to fine jewelry, sentimental shoppers seeking out talismans and personalized jewels \u201cto mark the occasion,\u201d and women in search of the feel-good experience of buying pieces for themselves. \u201cWomen, as we know, bore a lot of the burden of the lockdown \u2014 and we definitely heard a lot about them rewarding themselves, or husbands rewarding them,\u201d Ms. Santo Domingo said. Even though most retail jewelry stores around the world have been open since June, the shift to buying online has remained constant through the second half of the year. Alice Cicolini, a London-based designer specializing in enamel and gold jewelry, said her four-year-old online business, while relatively small at the start of the year, had grown by 300 percent to 400 percent compared with 2019 \u2014 although she declined to disclose sales numbers. She has also seen a notable pickup in bespoke commissions, she said, with most orders originating through direct messages on Instagram or via email. Ms. Cicolini referred to the less frenzied pace of life circa 2020 as an explanation for people seeking out her work. \u201cPeople have time they haven\u2019t had before \u2014 to think about the stone they have been meaning to get reset since they inherited it, or simply to discover what they like and what is out there,\u201d she wrote in an email. The considerable amount of time many people are now spending on screens has had another drastic effect on jewelry sales, which the industry has been calling \u201cthe Zoom phenomenon.\u201d \u201cWe saw a rapid decline in ring sales during lockdown (presumably from relentless hand washing) and takeup in necklaces and earrings (that can be seen on Zoom),\u201d Cecily Motley, co-founder of the affordable jewelry brand Motley London, wrote in an email. While it may be too soon to tell how the pandemic has influenced jewelry design \u2014 other than prioritizing styles worn from the shoulders up \u2014 it\u2019s clear that during this year of lockdowns, both real and potential, jewelry buyers are gravitating to simpler, more contemporary designs that can be worn at home. \u201cImagine daytime couture meets loungewear \u2014 that\u2019s the vibe,\u201d the Hong Kong-based private jeweler Nicholas Lieou wrote in an email. As the industry revs up for the final few weeks of the year, independent jewelry retailers said they are in a better position to capitalize on steady demand for fine jewels than their bigger, more corporate competitors. Katherine Jetter, a jewelry designer who in late October opened a private atelier in Boston called the Vault Boston, described a recent shopping event she organized for a small group of clients in a friend\u2019s garden, where she invited them to try on jewelry, take pieces home and bring them back if they decided not to buy. \u201cIt was all outside with their masks on, and people were excited to have something to do,\u201d Ms. Jetter said. She said she would spend the next few weeks staging intimate events such as cognac and wine tastings for friends and couples looking to splurge on jewelry. \u201cWe had two women come over to my atelier on Sunday, and we did Champagne and caviar,\u201d Ms. Jetter said in mid-November. \u201cThey got to have fun and be relaxed, and I kept my mask on.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a labor-intensive way to operate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in this environment, I don\u2019t see any other way to do it.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Getting Creative for the 2020 Office Holiday Party On Dec. 18, a festively decorated double-decker bus will stop in New Jersey and New York City to pick up the few employees of Consultancy Media, a broadcast media studio and production company. Each will be handed kits containing prepackaged snacks, rubber gloves, hand sanitizer and a themed face mask, which they will be required to put on before boarding and sitting eight feet apart. A masked bartender will serve a \u201cVery Consultancy\u201d cocktail,\u201d which guests will occasionally lower their masks to sip. They will pass around a karaoke microphone with gloved hands and \u2014 somewhat muffled \u2014 belt out everything from Frank Sinatra to heavy metal Christmas tunes as the bus travels past several light shows. Since no escorts are allowed, the event will meet Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s Covid-19 cap of 10 people at a New York gathering. Welcome to the office holiday party, an annual rite already imperiled by anti-harassment reforms that now must try to keep a most unwelcome guest, the no-longer-novel coronavirus, from spoiling the fun. To put it mildly, this been a tough year for corporate America: furloughs, layoffs, pay cuts; juggling parenting or elder care with work (or picking up other people\u2019s slack). Now throw seasonal affective disorder into the mix. \u201cI have been giving mental health talks for large employers and they\u2019re coming to me saying employee morale is lower than ever,\u201d said Dr. Nina Vasan, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. Taking a moment to recognize efforts and having fun as a team can help to elevate low spirits, and therefore many employers are adamant about plowing ahead with a holiday celebration. But throwing a party in late 2020 isn\u2019t remotely easy, even for professional event planners and producers. Cynika Drake, 41, the president of Lavish Lifestyles Concierge in New York City, said her No. 1 goal is to keep clients, staff and vendors safe (No. 2 is to show them a good time). She recently took a Covid-19 tracing course given by Johns Hopkins University and a class about mitigating viral transmission, contact tracing, positive symptom protocol and enforcing guidelines through Health Education Services. In August Ms. Drake and her colleagues began setting up a drive-in \u201cwinter wonderland experience\u201d for a local law firm. Servers dressed in Santa costumes were going to deliver cocoa on roller skates to guests in cars as carolers, jazz musicians and a pianist performed. But on Nov. 13, local virus protocols tightened and the party is being revamped. The new plan, Ms. Drake said, \u201cwill likely include Santa delivering warm brownies, hot chocolate and a link to a playlist of holiday tunes\u201d to employees\u2019 homes. Keith Willard, 51, the owner of Keith Willard Events in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has put together an outdoor scavenger hunt for a corporate client. \u201cEach guest will be given a pair of binoculars (to allow social distancing) and company-branded masks,\u201d he said. The clues lead guests to a barn for a dinner with tables of two, 10 feet apart. Executives will appear onstage as masked servers deliver meals and holiday gifts to tables. But with the virus surging, Mr. Willard and his client are currently deciding if it\u2019s safe to proceed. If not, he\u2019ll get to work on a virtual proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s never been this hard,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t have an easy job to start with.\u201d JoAnn Gregoli, 55, the owner of Elegant Occasions by JoAnn Gregoli, has been going all out to wow her holiday clients with lower contagion risk: building an ice-skating rink in the parking lot of a Connecticut corporation, creating a drive-in retro diner for another company \u2014 \u201cWe are hiring a band to play \u201950s music and people can dance around their cars to experience an old-fashioned sock hop,\u201d she said \u2014 and renting a beach in Miami for a client\u2019s socially distanced picnic, \u201ctemperature checks upon arrival.\u201d And Heather Roonan, 36, a content manager with GigSalad, an entertainment booking service, said companies are still hiring performers for parties but their services are continually being modified. Santa may toss out gifts but he isn\u2019t getting anywhere near partygoers \u2014 \u201cand definitely no lap sitting,\u201d Ms. Roonan said. And since singing has a higher risk of viral transmission, companies are requiring at least 10 feet between guests and carolers. On the bright side, stressing about looking cute but professional at these mixers will likely no longer be a problem. The Product Analyst, a tech review site in Memphis, was going to scrap its holiday event but the staff requested one so they found a compromise: a P.P.E.-themed soiree. \u201cWith safety as the theme, we can assure a low-risk party, with double the amount of fun,\u201d said the company\u2019s corporate wellness expert, Alicia Hough, 31. She\u2019s challenging her colleagues to turn masks, gloves and gowns into costumes like Avengers characters or spacesuits. Digital Air Strike, a consumer engagement technology company in Scottsdale, Ariz., is, according to the C.E.O. Alexi Venneri, saying \u201cGiddy-up to 2020\u201d with a party at MacDonald\u2019s Ranch. Seventy staff members in Western attire will \u201cchoose their own adventure: explore the desert on horseback, relax on a hayride or ride in their very own stagecoach,\u201d she said. In the past, the company has had holiday boat rides around the San Francisco Bay with Vanilla Ice performing and partied with Wayne Newton at his estate in Las Vegas. This year, the company is requiring employees to stay outdoors, wear custom face coverings and is prohibiting spouses or dates. \u201cWe will feel very safe, especially since we are spreading out all the activities,\u201d Ms. Venneri, 49, said. Less relaxingly, AllTrails, an outdoor fitness app in San Francisco, is organizing its 50 employees into small groups to hike, mountain bike and trail run on paths with the least amount of foot traffic \u2014 located with the company technology, naturally. \u201cDogs and festive attire will be welcomed,\u201d said Meaghan Praznik, 32, the head of communications. At Test Prep Insight, in Sacramento, Calif., \u201cGiven the constraints put on us by Covid, both physically and financially, we\u2019re doing something a little off the wall for our holiday party this year,\u201d said John Ross, 33, the president and C.E.O. His team is meeting at a mountain for sledding, snowshoeing and a snowman-building competition. \u201cI am bringing supplies \u2014 carrots, old scarves, etc. \u2014 and the first place team will win $200 in Amazon gift cards,\u201d Mr. Ross said. When it was time to host an annual office holiday gathering, Daniel Penzing, 34, the general manager of Maze of Our Lives, a marketing company in Schaumburg, Ill., was at a loss. But Jan Neubau, 37, the technical director and head of the party planning committee, drew from his German background and decided to turn the company\u2019s parking lot into a market with bratwurst, fried doughnuts and hot wine. Mr. Neubau said he is hoping people remember that their co-workers \u201care not just Slack or Zoom robots.\u201d In the past, office Christmas parties have been big deals to companies like SmileDirectClub, which in recent years hosted its Christmas party at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville with on-ice activities, photo booths and Nashville Predators locker room tours. \u201cOur team members look forward to it every year,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief people officer, Cheryl DeSantis, 50. This year, the company is offering a catered boxed lunch at the manufacturing facility in Antioch, Tenn., for the team working on-site. Remote employees will party virtually with games like Price Is Right White Elephant. And if you\u2019re looking for inspiration across the pond (\u201cThe Office,\u201d after all, began as a British series), Christopher Panteli, 33, the owner of Leominster Fish Bar, is taking his employees to let off some steam at a local go-karting track. \u201cIt will be a 50 lap marathon and the winner takes a huge Christmas bonus,\u201d he said. Since Mr. Panteli announced his party plans, go-karting is all his staff talks about, he said. It\u2019s \u201ca way to mask the cold bleak reality we have all been living with for the majority of the year.\u201d For many, a virtual party is the only option this year. And employers know it\u2019s going to take a lot to get staff excited about spending more time in front of a computer. Thus, planners are having to get extra-creative with virtual celebrations, compelling interactivity. Unexpected Virtual Tours is offering virtual ugly sweater-making contests (for $34.99 a sweater kit will be mailed to each guest) with add-on options like the \u201cFeminist Treat Box,\u201d which includes Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris confectionery, a Ruth Bader Ginsburg mask and an \u201cEmpowered Women\u201d kitchen towel. For $200 per guest, Don\u2019t Let the Day Go By is offering virtual oyster shucking parties. The company is also hosting gingerbread house decorating, as well as a blackjack master class with Mike Aponte, one of the M.I.T. students who won millions in Las Vegas, as chronicled in the book \u201cBringing Down the House.\u201d For a fee starting at $15,000, AccessElite will connect corporate clients over videoconference to Courtney Holston-Toph, an artist in Newport Beach, Calif., to offer ideas for a company mural to be live-painted through Twitch. \u201cDigital prints are mailed to remote workers for their home offices as a way of giving everyone a piece of the company culture they helped create,\u201d Ms. Holston-Toph said. Other companies are avoiding Zoom altogether, like SEMRush, a digital marketing solutions company in Boston, which is having a livestream \u201cNetflix-style Christmas party\u201d during which employees click a link to bounce between four interactive channels for experiences like standup comedy, D.I.Y. bath bomb workshops, science lessons or a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d virtual quest where attendees guide an actor through a mission. Spotify, Pandora and LinkedIn employees will be doing face masks together \u2014 and not the protective kind. Scratch Goods will send them the ingredients \u2014 rejuvenating face masks, a bamboo brush and facial oil \u2014 needed for an at-home facial, which they will apply together on their screens. Intel is hosting its holiday event in virtual reality with the help of Event Farm, an experiential marketing company in Atlanta that is also working with Facebook,\u00a0Dell, LG and Bosch. \u201cPartygoers will download the V.R. software on their personal computers, design their avatars and mingle with co-workers using their computer\u2019s audio, all while enjoying wine and prepping meals alongside a celebrity chef \u2014 meal kits will be sent to their homes ahead of time,\u201d said Ryan Costello, 41, a founder of Event Farm. For Thanksgiving, Hormel mailed out turkey taco and cocktail ingredients for guided tutorials, as well as led attendees through a dessert-making and table design demo, all topped off with a Boyz II Men live performance. The company won\u2019t yet reveal its Christmas plan but Paul Zahn, 40, the host and planner it hired, promised it will be \u201cnext level!\u201d In the meantime, many employers are scrapping parties altogether and planning to go big in 2021 instead \u2014 when, if all goes as hoped, they can bring back the open bar.",

    "article_text": "My Dad Is Going to Paint His Way Through the Pandemic \u201cYou just hate me and want me to die!\u201d Should I be angry at my 8-year-old or proud of his dramatic flair? It\u2019s yet another meltdown over distance learning. This is not going well, to put it mildly. Virtual school is a disaster for my three big kids, and our toddler is basically feral at this point. My husband works away from home. I\u2019m proud he\u2019s essential, but wish he weren\u2019t. As tears flow down my cheeks, I hear the front door open. It\u2019s my dad, and he\u2019s shown up with paint and his favorite paintbrush (a Wooster silver-tip angle brush). Relief floods me. I forgot he was coming today, or maybe he didn\u2019t even tell me. Honestly, my wall calendar still says March. Since Pittsburgh\u2019s initial shelter-in-place order lifted in May, my parents have been part of our close circle of contacts. We would not be surviving without them. Two full-time jobs, four kids under 9. Their support has been crucial throughout these endless months. My mom shows up with board games, cookies to decorate and crafts to make. My kids squeal when they see her car. \u201cGaga!\u201d They shriek her name as if the pop star herself is rolling up. Gaga shows up with her Marshall\u2019s shopping bag of goodies at least twice a week. But my dad shows up with a paintbrush. I suspect he isn\u2019t quite sure how to help. He is not one to ask for the Google Classroom assignments, grab a pack of multiplication flashcards or get to know my kids\u2019 teachers through a Chromebook camera. My dad has always been the more practical type, and most of our quality time together throughout my life has been spent doing something. So, my dad takes his prized brush into our bathroom. He\u2019s a quiet support when everything is falling apart. As my eldest, Eli, cries over confusion in math, too scared to unmute Google Meets to ask for help, my dad invites him to paint the trim around the window. I tamp down the urge to point out that he is in school. We all need a moment to regroup sometimes. Pap gently instructs him about the direction to paint and tells him how my grandfather taught him during long summers working on apartment buildings. My dad\u2019s been connecting with us through painting for as long as I can recall. As an angsty tween, I helped him paint the future living room of the house he built, while Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex\u201d blared uncomfortably in the background. I feigned boredom, but, as one of three kids, I was just happy to get time with him. As I grew into adulthood and became a homeowner myself, I applied the skills my dad had taught me. Every surface of our first home was covered in wallpaper and, before kids, my husband and I spent many hours steaming psychedelic blue flowers off our bathroom ceiling. But by 2010, our infertility journey had led us to the exhausting paper chase of an adoption home study. The process of becoming certified to adopt children is long and arduous, beginning with personal interviews and ending with a home inspection. We were halfway through repainting our kitchen cabinets before we realized we were in over our heads, with a social worker visit looming. Social workers don\u2019t actually care about an HGTV-worthy home, but they do need you to clear out all of the chipping, peeling lead paint. My dad and I spent one long evening in our basement painting cabinet doors. As we worked in quiet companionship, I shared my fears about the love and loss that would bring a child to this home. Adoption is complicated, though the world likes to couch it in unicorns and rainbows. Several years later, my husband and I sat hours from home in an unfamiliar hospital, in an unfamiliar city. Newborn twins were settled into our arms, as their mom made the decision to place them for adoption. We felt wholly awed by these beautiful babies, while at the same time dazed at expanding our family in an instant. While we learned how to balance our fast food dinner with two babies in our arms, my dad worked furiously to transform our spare bedroom \u2014 replacing dated wallpaper with a cheery yellow. When we walked through the door carrying two car seats, the smell of fresh paint wrapped around me like a hug. I knew my dad had been there. Now, true to form, he\u2019s going to paint his way through the pandemic. Seven-year-old Ezra busts out of his bedroom full of wiggles. My dad is cutting new pieces of trim in the backyard for his bathroom project. Learning to read might be too much right now, but learning to miter quarter round is therapeutic. Once it\u2019s placed back in the bathroom, Ezra can paint right over those nail holes. It looks as good as new. If only the damage to ourselves during this crisis were so easy to remedy. My toddler, Naarah, waves a paint brush at the wall, getting paint all over herself. I don\u2019t care. She\u2019s helping Pap, doing something other than watching Peppa Pig while I hover over her siblings in \u201cclass.\u201d When strangers pass us on the street she shoves us to the side and screams \u201cBUBBLE!\u201d She\u2019s developed a fear of anyone getting close to us after nine months of social distancing and regularly uses words like \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cshy.\u201d My heart breaks for the confusion her earliest memories will contain. I pray a memory of painting with her Pap is stronger than those of strangers looking down at her with masks covering their smiles. Naomi, Ezra\u2019s twin sister, is a social butterfly and enjoys distance learning. I\u2019m convinced navigating her school-issued iPad is preparing her to become some type of social media influencer. I ignore the pouty kissy faces she makes at her classmates. I might get an email about it later, but at least she sat all morning. I\u2019ll take the small wins. She takes her turn for a few quiet moments to paint with my dad. She tells me, \u201cRemember always that I painted this part, when it\u2019s all done, OK?\u201d I promise her I will. Every time I scrub toothpaste off that bench I will remember her little hands holding that paintbrush. Painting is how my dad loves. Many grandparents during the pandemic are struggling to figure out how to provide guidance in a situation they\u2019ve never experienced. They\u2019ve raised their kids, and it didn\u2019t include anything like this. They feel helpless. So they do the only thing they can. They show up. And for my dad, that includes his Wooster silver-tip angle brush in hand. Meg St-Esprit is a freelance writer based in Pittsburgh.",

    "article_text": "After Defying Virus Rules, Bar Manager Drives Car Into Sheriff\u2019s Deputy The manager of a Staten Island bar who has repeatedly and flamboyantly defied New York\u2019s coronavirus restrictions hit a sheriff\u2019s deputy with his Jeep early Sunday as he unsuccessfully tried to escape arrest, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The bar, Mac\u2019s Public House, was ordered closed by the state on Wednesday, but deputies said they found several patrons being served there on Saturday night. When deputies confronted the manager, Daniel Presti, he fled to his Jeep and drove into one of the deputies, throwing him onto the hood, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Mr. Presti, 34, faces 10 charges, including assault with intent to cause injury to an officer, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and resisting arrest, according to a criminal complaint filed on Sunday. He was released on his own recognizance and has a hearing scheduled for January, court records show. Joseph Fucito, the city sheriff, said the deputy had been released from the hospital but sustained fractures in each of his shin bones. It was Mr. Presti\u2019s second arrest in six days in connection with the bar\u2019s defiance of shutdown rules. The bar has become a rallying point for defiance of virus restrictions in recent weeks. Located in a state-designated zone where indoor service is banned because of a surge in virus cases, it continued to serve patrons even after its liquor license was suspended at the end of November. In rallies outside the tavern and in YouTube videos and Facebook posts, Mr. Presti and the bar\u2019s owner, Keith McAlarney, have maintained that the restrictions in Staten Island are unjust and impinge on their freedom. They have said people should be able to decide whether to risk being infected while patronizing the bar, and have declared the establishment an \u201cautonomous zone.\u201d In Staten Island, the city\u2019s most conservative borough and a stronghold for President Trump, their argument has earned the bar many followers. Hundreds of people rallied outside Mac\u2019s Public House on Wednesday and the Proud Boys, a far-right group that has endorsed violence, claimed on their Parler account that they had been in attendance. An online fund-raiser in support of the bar had gathered more than $80,000 in donations as of Sunday morning. The rally at the bar was referenced sardonically this weekend on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d during the Weekend Update segment. \u201cPeople were outside the bar, shouting about freedom, taunting the cops, chanting that they should arrest the governor,\u201d Pete Davidson, a well-known Staten Island native, said during the segment. \u201cBut it\u2019s Staten Island, so I assume that it was just a typical last call.\u201d Mr. Presti\u2019s lawyers, Louis Gelormino and Mark Fonte, said in a written statement on the incident that Mr. Presti did not know who was confronting him in the dark and sought refuge in his car but was pulled out. Mr. Presti was \u201cunaware of how anyone sustained injury,\u201d according to the statement. The lawyers said the sheriff\u2019s deputies \u201care clearly untrained and outside their element.\u201d They refused to say whether Mr. Presti was driving. But Sheriff Fucito said that the lawyers\u2019 statement was \u201cnot supported by facts.\u201d He said deputies showed \u201camazing restraint in taking Mr. Presti into custody without injury to Mr. Presti.\u201d Mr. Presti\u2019s arrest on Sunday touched off a fresh debate about his tactics and his treatment by law enforcement. \u201cWhether it\u2019s flouting public health laws or ramming a car into a deputy, this guy clearly has no regard for the lives of others,\u201d Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said. Michael Reilly, a Republican state assemblyman representing parts of Staten Island that do not include the bar, said Mr. Presti\u2019s actions were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cWe can protest and call for changes all we want, but resisting arrest and assaulting law enforcement officers is not the way to do that,\u201d he said. Brad Lander, a Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn, questioned whether Mr. Presti would have been released without bail after being accused of assaulting a law enforcement officer if he were Black. \u201cWhat happens for white people accused of offenses and what happens for Black and brown people accused of offenses is profoundly different,\u201d he said. Mr. Presti\u2019s arrest on Sunday came as a second wave of the pandemic tightened its grip on New York City. The seven-day average rate of positive test results, which was less than 2 percent at the beginning of November, is now more than 5 percent for the first time since May, according to city figures. Hospitalizations have steadily ticked up over the last three months. The city\u2019s health commissioner last week urged people over 65 years old or those who face an increased risk of severe illness from the virus to halt all nonessential activities and stay home. The part of Staten Island where the bar is located has been a particular area of concern. It had a seven-day average test positivity rate of 7.58 percent, according to figures published on Saturday from the state. In late November, the state reopened an emergency hospital in the borough to address a surge in cases. Still, Mac\u2019s Public House stayed open after hours despite Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew for bars and restaurants. When indoor service in the area was banned because of the surge in cases, the bar continued to serve customers. On Nov. 27, the state suspended the bar\u2019s liquor license. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Mr. Presti on Tuesday after the bar continued to violate state and city health orders. Then on Wednesday, the state shut the bar down. Mr. de Blasio told \u201cThe Brian Lehrer Show\u201d on WNYC that most businesses had been adhering to state and local health measures. Mac\u2019s Public House was an anomaly and \u201cobviously wanted to get publicity for themselves,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cThey made a big deal of it, but they\u2019re shut down now,\u201d he added. But in a Facebook post on Saturday, the bar said it would be open for service again that evening. Deputies on Saturday evening saw people entering a commercial space next to the bar, which had \u201cpreviously appeared empty and unused during previous visits to the location,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. But deputies believed that people were walking through the commercial space and entering the bar through a back door. Deputies saw Mr. Presti inside the bar, where people were being served food and alcohol in exchange for a \u201cmonetary donation,\u201d according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Around midnight, Mr. Presti left the bar through the front door and was headed to his car nearby when deputies confronted him and tried to arrest him, but Mr. Presti fled on foot, got into his car and drove into one of the deputies, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The deputy was thrown onto the hood of the car, the office said. Mr. Presti was not injured.",

    "article_text": "Some Colleges Plan to Bring Back More Students in the Spring It was a tough fall semester for many American colleges and universities, with declining enrollment, canceled classes and sporting events, widespread Zoom fatigue and enough coronavirus-infected students nationwide to fill three and a half Rose Bowls. But many university officials say that lessons from the fall will allow them to do something many experts considered unthinkable a few months ago: bring even more students back onto campus in January and February, when classes resume for the spring. The University of California, San Diego, for instance, is making room for more than 11,000 students in campus housing \u2014 about 1,000 more than it housed in the fall. The University of Florida is planning to offer more face-to-face classes than it did before the pandemic. And Princeton University, which let only a few hundred students live on campus last semester, has offered space to thousands of undergraduates. The determination to bring back more students, even as the pandemic is surging in many states, partly reflects the financial imperative to have more students paying room and board, as well as the desire to provide something resembling a college experience. But there is also an emerging confidence among at least some college administrators that they have learned much about managing the pandemic on their campuses. Test aggressively. Contact trace assiduously. Maintain mask rules and social distancing. And don\u2019t underestimate students\u2019 willingness to obey restrictions. \u201cWhat makes me optimistic is we had the virus in our community, and each time we did, we were able to stop transmissions dead,\u201d said David Greene, president of Colby College in Maine, which brought its whole student body back in the fall using aggressive health measures, and plans to do the same again next semester. Experts said a major test of whether colleges learned the right lessons would come in January and February, when students travel back to school from home. \u201cThe disease is a lot more widespread now than it was\u201d in the fall, said Dr. Tom Frieden, who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama Administration and is now president of a global health initiative to prevent heart disease and epidemics. \u201cWhen people travel, the virus travels.\u201d Since the start of the pandemic, campuses have weighed the financial and social benefits of business as usual against the terrifying risk of Covid-19. Young people are statistically less likely than older adults to become severely ill or die from the infection, but they have turned college towns into Covid-19 hot spots. Schools and the communities around them have also enforced public health rules inconsistently. Many institutions are choosing not to bring back more students, planning instead to hunker down over the winter as infections mount and the nation awaits a vaccine. The University of Michigan, which spent a rocky fall trying to keep thousands of students on campus, has told most of its students to stay home and study remotely next semester. The California State University\u2019s 23 campuses have concluded that sticking with remote classes is the safest approach for the spring. But other schools, and some experts, are asking: Safe compared with what? \u201cHaving students return to campus to live under the imperfect supervision of college administrators is risky,\u201d said A. David Paltiel, a professor of health policy and management at the Yale School of Public Health. \u201cBut having students stay home to live under the imperfect supervision of their parents and families is also risky.\u201d That argument has been particularly compelling for schools that managed the fall with relatively minimal infections, and the schools that watched and learned from them. Cornell University expects about 19,500 students will be living on or around its Ithaca, N.Y., campus next semester, more than 80 percent of enrollment and about 1,500 more students than were there during the fall. Brown will roughly triple, and Harvard will about double, the number of students in campus housing in the new year. Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., will add about 100 students to the approximately 1,200 who were living on campus in the fall. It also plans to re-establish its study abroad programs, according to a school spokesman. Students have also proved more conscientious than the public may think, administrators said. The culture of fraternities, big sports and big parties remains a challenge, but at many schools, students themselves reported the majority of health violations. \u201cWhen this started the premise was that students would not and could not behave responsibly,\u201d said Michael Kotlikoff, Cornell University\u2019s provost. \u201cI think we\u2019ve proven that this is not so.\u201d Many university officials say they are also increasingly confident that the virus is not being transmitted in classrooms, where professors are enforcing mask wearing and social distancing rules. \u201cWe have not had a single case that we can trace to a classroom,\u201d said Mike Haynie, vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation at Syracuse University. \u201cIt happened in communal living situations and in gatherings that took place off campus.\u201d Mr. Haynie cited a study of 70,000 undergraduates at Indiana University, which found that the more classes a student took in person, the lower the likelihood that student would become infected with the coronavirus. \u201cThe spread is in teacher break rooms, in fraternities and sororities,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even in organized sports but in locker rooms before and pizza parties after.\u201d Syracuse has seen a \u201csignificant decrease\u201d in undergraduates signing up for remote learning in the spring, indicating that more will elect to live on campus, according to the university\u2019s press office. The university had about 15,000 students on campus this fall and expects the number to grow in the spring. Steven Constable, a geophysicist at U.C. San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and chair of the school\u2019s academic senate, said data showing negligible transmission in classrooms had helped bring skeptical university employees on board with the university\u2019s plan to add some in-person classes. \u201cYou could argue that our lecture halls are one of the safer places to be in San Diego right now,\u201d he said. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Instructors at other schools have been a harder sell. At the University of Florida, faculty have filed grievances over the school\u2019s decision to offer 5,394 sections of face-to-face classes, 72 more than were offered last January, before the pandemic hit the United States. Concerns have persisted even though the school, which offered only optional testing this fall when it invited its 50,000 students back to campus, will expand its testing regimen, requiring that all students living on campus or taking classes in person be tested every two weeks in the spring. Some faculty are also revolting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The university sent most students home a week after classes began in August because of an outbreak, but is now proposing to bring 2,000 students back to campus residence halls, on top of 1,500 who were allowed to stay during the fall for hardship reasons. It will also offer about one out of five classes in person in the spring semester. This month, about 70 faculty members signed an open letter, published in the student newspaper, that predicted a repeat of the fall debacle. \u201cWe have every reason to expect that the university will \u2014 once again \u2014 be overwhelmed by infections when classes resume,\u201d the letter said. But the university\u2019s president, Kevin Guskiewicz, said he was confident the university could pull it off. \u201cWe\u2019re working from a different starting place than we were in the fall,\u201d he said. The value of aggressive coronavirus testing has been one of the major lessons of the fall. \u201cWe changed our testing protocols substantially over the semester,\u201d said Michael Fitts, Tulane\u2019s president. \u201cAt one point, we moved it up to three times a week, and we found that was very effective, and we will continue that in the spring.\u201d Tulane has access to two testing machines through its medical school, which can conduct 3,000 tests a day and have results back in 12 hours. \u201cI will say our positivity rate was much lower than New Orleans,\u201d Mr. Fitts said of the university, which calls the city home. Syracuse learned its lesson after Halloween, when the lab it was using produced results too slowly and transmission got out of hand, Mr. Haynie said. Now the university has its own testing lab, within the biology department. For the spring, it plans to double its capacity to about 300,000 tests between January and May. \u201cWe realized we had to have full control and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Haynie said. Similarly Cornell University set up a lab in its veterinary school, where it can perform 35,000 to 40,000 tests a week and get results back in as little as eight hours. U.C. San Diego is processing its own tests, too. U.C. San Diego is doing not only standard swab testing, but also testing wastewater, expanding contact tracing with a phone app and moving instruction to outdoor classrooms. As of Saturday, the school had recorded only about 70 cases since March among the more than 9,000 students living on campus, according to the school dashboard. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Swiss cheese model,\u201d said Pradeep Khosla, U.C. San Diego\u2019s chancellor and an engineer who specializes in system building. \u201cEvery layer has its holes, but put together, it\u2019s a solid block.\u201d Most college officials do not expect a vaccine to be available for students in the spring term. But many universities, like the University of Kentucky, are planning to be integrally involved in the distribution of vaccines through their health systems, which will position them for providing it on campus when the time comes. Though a vaccine might seem the light at the end of the Covid tunnel, it will also pose a new challenge for university administrators, said Crystal Watson, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cWill they make it mandatory for students, staff and faculty?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf not, will vaccination be required for some type of the population but not others? That\u2019s a big open question.\u201d Dr. Watson said that however far colleges have come, there is still a large gap between the wish for normalcy and the reality. \u201cRight now it looks so different from what a traditional campus would look like,\u201d she said. \u201cThe students are getting such a bad deal this year. It really stinks.\u201d",

Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear why Mr. Trump was the one announcing it. Mr. Giuliani recently traveled to three battleground states that Mr. Biden won to make his case. On Thursday he attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol, where he didn\u2019t wear a mask. He also went maskless on Wednesday at a legislative session in Michigan, where he lobbied Republicans to overturn the results of the election there and appoint a slate of electors for Trump. \u201cMayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia,\u201d the Trump campaign said. \u201cThe Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return.\u201d However, a person in contact with the former mayor said he began feeling ill late this past week. Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly been exposed to the virus through contact with infected people, including during Mr. Trump\u2019s preparation for his first debate against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. in September, just before the president tested positive. His infection is the latest in a string of outbreaks among those in the president\u2019s orbit. Boris Epshteyn, a member of the Trump campaign legal team, tested positive late last month. The same day, Mr. Giuliani attended a meeting of Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania about allegations of voting irregularities. One of the lawmakers at that meeting was notified shortly after, while at the White House, that he had tested positive. Mark Meadows, the president\u2019s chief of staff, and at least eight others in the White House and Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, tested positive in the days before and after Election Day. Mr. Trump was hospitalized on Oct. 2 after contracting the coronavirus. Kayleigh McEnany, the president\u2019s press secretary, Corey Lewandowski, a campaign adviser, and Ben Carson, the housing secretary, are among those in the president\u2019s circle who have tested positive this fall. Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News earlier on Sunday. Speaking with the host Maria Bartiromo via satellite, Mr. Giuliani repeated baseless claims about fraud in Georgia and Wisconsin on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d When asked if he believed Mr. Trump still had a path to victory, he said, \u201cWe do.\u201d Melina Delkic and Bryan Pietsch contributed reporting.  After a small White House outbreak in September and a wave of cases in early October, the coronavirus has returned to the top of the Trump administration.",

    "article_text": "China Peddles Falsehoods to Obscure Origin of Covid Pandemic The mild-mannered German scientist never anticipated becoming a Chinese propaganda star. But Alexander Kekul\u00e9, the director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle, Germany, has been all over the state-run media in China in recent days. News outlets have taken Dr. Kekul\u00e9\u2019s research out of context to suggest that Italy, not China, is where the coronavirus pandemic began. Photos of him have appeared on Chinese news sites under headlines reading, \u201cChina is innocent!\u201d Dr. Kekul\u00e9, who has repeatedly said that he believes the virus first emerged in China, was startled. \u201cThis is pure propaganda,\u201d he said in an interview. Facing global anger over their initial mishandling of the outbreak, the Chinese authorities are now trying to rewrite the narrative of the pandemic by pushing theories that the virus originated outside China. In recent days, Chinese officials have said that packaged food from overseas might have initially brought the virus to China. Scientists have released a paper positing that the pandemic could have started in India. The state news media has published false stories misrepresenting foreign experts, including Dr. Kekul\u00e9 and officials at the World Health Organization, as having said the coronavirus came from elsewhere. The campaign seems to reflect anxiety within the ruling Communist Party about the continuing damage to China\u2019s international reputation brought by the pandemic. Western officials have criticized Beijing for trying to conceal the outbreak when it first erupted. The party also appears eager to muddy the waters as the World Health Organization begins an investigation into the question of how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a critical inquiry that experts say is the best hope to avoid another pandemic. China, which has greatly expanded its influence in the W.H.O. in recent years, has tightly controlled the effort by designating Chinese scientists to lead key parts of the investigation. By spreading theories that foreigners are responsible for the pandemic, the party is deploying a well-worn playbook. The Chinese government is rarely willing to publicly address its own shortcomings, often preferring to redirect attention elsewhere and rally the country against a common enemy. China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has led a vigorous effort this year to play down his government\u2019s early failures in the crisis, instead arguing that the party\u2019s success in containing the virus shows the superiority of its authoritarian system. The latest propaganda push gives Mr. Xi a fresh chance to stoke nationalist sentiment and distract from festering problems, including a lingering wealth gap. The government seems wary of inviting renewed scrutiny of its actions as the pandemic began to unfold, analysts say. Mr. Xi most likely sees the party\u2019s missteps as a vulnerability and is eager to avoid potential challenges to his authority at home, said Erin Baggott Carter, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Southern California. \u201cIf Xi is able to escape blame for the coronavirus, that reduces one major source of discontent with his rule,\u201d she said. In some ways, China\u2019s strategy resembles efforts by American lawmakers to distract from missteps in that country by spreading fringe theories, including the unsubstantiated notion that the Chinese government manufactured the virus as a biological weapon. For months, Chinese officials openly spread conspiracy theories of their own, implying at one point that the United States military could have brought the virus to the city of Wuhan. Experts and officials are now going further, trying to give falsehoods about the origins of the virus the veneer of scientific fact. A recent paper by a group of scientists affiliated with the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that the virus could have broken out in India before spreading to China. \u201cWuhan is not the place where human-to-human SARS-CoV-2 transmission first happened,\u201d said the paper, which appeared last month on SSRN, an online scholarly repository. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, had been submitted to The Lancet, a medical journal, for publication. After drawing wide attention in the Chinese news media and in overseas outlets, the 22-page article vanished from online sites. A spokeswoman for The Lancet said it had been removed from SSRN at the request of the paper\u2019s authors. The scientists did not respond to requests for comment. The article was the latest in a series of comments and articles by Chinese scientists arguing that the virus had first surfaced in Italy, Spain or elsewhere before spreading to China. While recent studies have indicated that the coronavirus may have infected people in the United States and elsewhere earlier than previously thought, researchers still believe the most likely explanation is that it started circulating in China. Edward Holmes, a professor at the University of Sydney who has studied the coronavirus, said the idea that the virus originated outside China seemed to be gaining traction for political purposes. \u201cIt lacks scientific credibility and will only further fuel the conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. As part of their efforts to redirect attention toward other countries, Chinese scholars and officials have in recent weeks revived another unproven theory: that frozen food packages from abroad brought the virus to China. Chinese officials say they have detected the virus on pork from Germany, shrimp from Ecuador, salmon from Norway and other products. While the World Health Organization says the probability of becoming infected from coming into contact with food and food packaging is low, Chinese officials have doubled down on the theory. \u201cMore and more evidence suggests that the frozen seafood or meat products probably spread the virus from countries with the epidemic into our country,\u201d Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent interview posted on a government website. Even if the virus could spread through frozen goods, experts say packaged food alone cannot explain why the first major outbreak took place in Wuhan. As it seeks to push its theories on the global stage, the Chinese government has distorted comments from foreign experts to falsely suggest that there is broad consensus that the virus first surfaced outside China. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization\u2019s emergency director, spoke recently about the need for a rigorous investigation into how the virus spread from animals to humans. \u201cWe need to start where we found the first cases and that is in Wuhan in China,\u201d Dr. Ryan said at a news conference late last month in Geneva. But in China, the government framed Dr. Ryan\u2019s remarks differently. The news media falsely claimed that he had said the virus existed around the world but happened to be discovered in Wuhan. Dr. Ryan was more explicit a few days later, saying the idea that the virus originated outside China was \u201chighly speculative.\u201d Official news outlets in China did not report that remark. When Dr. Kekul\u00e9, the German scientist, appeared on a television news show last month to discuss the pandemic, he made a point of saying that it was clear the virus had first emerged in China. During the interview, he also criticized European officials for taking too long to detect the virus, saying it enabled Covid-19 to spread across the globe. Chinese news outlets seized on the latter remarks. \u201cHe noted that for a global pandemic, the starting shot was fired in northern Italy,\u201d said a report by China Global Television Network, an international arm of the official Chinese state broadcaster. Dr. Kekul\u00e9, who has written a book about the pandemic, was distraught and set out to correct the record, going on German television again to say he had been misquoted. \u201cChina uses everything for propaganda,\u201d Dr. Kekul\u00e9 said in an interview. \u201cI started to realize that I had to do something about it.\u201d But Dr. Kekul\u00e9\u2019s efforts were largely in vain. Video clips of his remarks about Europe had already spread widely on the Chinese internet. Thousands of people were sharing state media articles about his research, leaving comments such as, \u201cA billion people in China thank you!\u201d and \u201cThere are not many scientists who dare tell the truth.\u201d A simple phrase appeared in red writing above Dr. Kekul\u00e9\u2019s face in a meme that circulated online: \u201cNot Wuhan.\u201d Chris Buckley contributed reporting.

    "article_text": "Le cicatrici invisibili dei reduci della tragedia di Bergamo NEMBRO, Italia\u2014 Ogni luned\u00ec sera, nella chiesa del comune italiano che ha avuto uno dei tassi di mortalit\u00e0 per coronavirus pi\u00f9 alto d\u2019Europa, una psicologa specializzata in disturbi post-traumatici tiene delle sessioni di terapia di gruppo. \u201cHa curato reduci di guerra,\u201d Don Matteo Cella, il parroco della cittadina, Nembro, in provincia di Bergamo, racconta della psicologa. \u201cDice che la dinamica \u00e8 la stessa\u201d. Prima il virus \u00e8 esploso a Bergamo. Poi \u00e8 stato il momento del trauma. La provincia che per prima ha dato all\u2019Occidente un\u2019anteprima degli orrori che sarebbero arrivati \u2014 la fame di ossigeno dei nonni, gli ospedali brulicanti e i convogli di bare che attraversavano le strade vuote \u2014 \u00e8 diventata ora una cartolina inquietante da un domani post-traumatico. Nelle piccole citt\u00e0 dove tutti si conoscono tra loro, c\u2019\u00e8 una sorta di apprensione per gli altri, ma ci sono anche la sindrome del sopravvissuto, i ripensamenti sulle scelte decisive e gli incubi su quegli ultimi desideri infranti. Mentre il virus si diffonde di nuovo, dilaga la paura che l\u2019enorme sacrificio di Bergamo svanir\u00e0 presto nella storia, che i suoi paesini diventeranno campi di battaglia dimenticati della prima grande ondata, che i suoi morti saranno solo nomi scolpiti sull\u2019ennesima targa arrugginita. E soprattutto c\u2019\u00e8 uno sforzo collettivo di capire come il virus abbia cambiato le persone. Non solo i loro anticorpi, ma anche loro stessi. \u201cMi ha chiuso di pi\u00f9\u201d, ha detto Monia Cagnoni, 41, che ha perso la madre a causa del virus e poi preso la polmonite, racconta seduta a distanza dalla sorella sui gradini della loro casa di famiglia. \u201cVoglio stare pi\u00f9 da sola\u201d. Sua sorella, Cinzia, 44, che ha preparato del caff\u00e8 e una torta in cucina, ha il desiderio opposto. \u201cHo pi\u00f9 bisogno di gente che mai\u201d, ha spiegato. \u201cNon mi piace stare sola\u201d. Bergamo, come ogni altro luogo, ora fronteggia la seconda ondata del virus. Ma il suo sacrificio l\u2019ha lasciata pi\u00f9 protetta di molti altri luoghi, dato che secondo i medici la prima ondata ha conferito alla popolazione un certo grado di immunit\u00e0. I suoi medici hanno ormai ormai interiorizzato i terribili protocolli imposti dal virus, e si prendono cura di pazienti che vengono da fuori provincia per alleviare il peso sui sovraccarichi ospedali della zona. Ma anche mentre il contagio li minaccia dall\u2019esterno, le ferite della prima ondata li consumano dall\u2019interno. Parlare di queste cose non \u00e8 facile per la gente che vive nel cuore industriale d\u2019Italia, denso di fabbriche metalmeccaniche e tessili, cartiere, colonne di fumo ondeggianti e capannoni giganti. Preferiscono parlare di quanto lavorano. Quasi scusandosi, rivelano che stanno soffrendo. Nella citt\u00e0 di Osio Sopra, Sara Cagliani, 30, non riesce a superare il fatto di non aver esaudito l\u2019ultimo desiderio di suo padre. Sul suo cancello di casa c\u2019\u00e8 un cartello, \u201cQui vive un Alpino\u201d. Quando \u00e8 iniziata la crisi del coronavirus, suo padre, Alberto Cagliani, 67, ha offerto il suo aiuto, dicendo a sua figlia \u201cRicorda, io sono un Alpino, e noi ci siamo per le emergenze\u201d. L\u2019ex camionista, dopo essere andato in pensione, aveva fatto il volontario per un\u2019agenzia di pompe funebri, guidando in giro per la provincia e vestendo uomini morti in incidenti d\u2019auto in completi consegnati dalle famiglie. A febbraio ha continuato a fare il volontario, ma questa volta il numero di corpi era travolgente. \u00c8 diventato taciturno e ha smesso di tornare a casa a mangiare. \u201cUn massacro senza fine\u201d, ha detto a sua figlia. Il 13 marzo, dopo essersi occupato di un\u2019altra vittima, ha iniziato a sentire un dolore alla spalla destra che si diramava verso la parte bassa della schiena. Il suono della televisione ha iniziato a dargli fastidio. Il 21 marzo, sua moglie l\u2019ha visto toccare gli asciugamani del bagno solo per vedere se riusciva a sentirne la consistenza. I suoi polpastrelli si erano desensibilizzati. Poi \u00e8 stato il turno delle gambe. \u00c8 morto di coronavirus il giorno seguente con dell\u2019acqua nei polmoni. Il suo ultimo desiderio \u00e8 stato di essere sepolto nella sua uniforme da Alpino, e sua figlia ha cercato di rispettare la sua volont\u00e0, spedendo una giacca e dei pantaloni verdi all\u2019agenzia di pompe funebri. Ma gli addetti l\u2019hanno mandato indietro, spiegando che il pericolo del contagio aveva reso la vestizione dei corpi impossibile. \u201cMetterlo in un sacco, questo \u00e8 il mio pi\u00f9 grande rimpianto\u201d, ha detto la signora Cagliani attraverso le lacrime, aggiungendo che ha cominciato a vedere uno psicologo. Questa tragedia, ha detto, ha lasciato un segno sulla sua comunit\u00e0. \u201cLe persone hanno paura di vedersi\u201d, ha detto. \u201cC\u2019\u00e8 una mancanza di affetto, di toccarsi, di stringersi\u201d. Altre persone vivono con angoscia le scelte terribili che il virus li ha costretti a fare. A met\u00e0 marzo, Laura Soliveri ha iniziato a occuparsi di sua madre che aveva sintomi riconducibili al Covid nel paese di Brignano Gera d\u2019Adda vicino Bergamo. I medici le hanno detto che non potevano andare a visitarla perch\u00e9 non avevano mascherine. Suo fratello, farmacista, l\u2019ha avvertita di non chiamare l\u2019ambulanza per far portare in ospedale la loro madre o non l\u2019avrebbero vista pi\u00f9. La signora Soliveri, insegnante elementare di 58 anni, ha girato la zona in cerca di bombole di ossigeno per sedare la fame di aria di sua madre. Alla fine ne ha trovata una. La mamma \u00e8 migliorata. Poi anche il marito della signora Soliveri, Gianni Pala, si \u00e8 ammalato di coronavirus. Lei e la famiglia hanno cercato di trovare altro ossigeno, questa volta per lui. Non potevano prendere quello di sua madre. Le condizioni del marito peggioravano e hanno dovuto ricoverarlo in ospedale. \u00c8 morto a 64 anni, il 5 aprile. Sua madre, 85 anni, \u00e8 sopravvissuta. \u201cMia madre aveva l\u2019ossigeno, ma non potevamo toglierlo a lei per darlo a lui\u201d, ha detto la Signora Soliveri, che ha iniziato fare psicoterapia e a prendere anti-depressivi, toccando la fede di suo marito che ha messo al proprio dito medio. \u201cIo lo avrei fatto\u201d. Il virus ha messo alla prova la fede di alcuni. La signora Soliveri dice di aver perduto la sua capacit\u00e0 di pregare. Ma ne ha anche fortificato il valore in altre persone. In estate, Raffaella Mezzetti, 48 anni, volontaria per l\u2019associazione cattolica Caritas, ha spiegato che la fede \u00e8 diventata come un balsamo per chi \u00e8 rimasto traumatizzato. Ma ha aggiunto che aveva ancora i brividi quando sentiva le canzoni delle pubblicit\u00e0 che la televisione trasmetteva allora. Le sirene delle ambulanze, che magari portavano le donne in ospedale a partorire, la rendevano nervosa. \u201cTi rimane dentro\u201d, ha detto. Il giorno dei Morti a Nembro un volontario spruzzava gel sanificante sulle mani di centinaia di persone che hanno perso un caro, prima di entrare al cimitero ad ascoltare Padre Cella. Delia Morotti, 57 anni, anche lei affetta dal virus e poi guarita, ha lasciato la messa in anticipo. Sentire tutti i nomi dei morti la faceva arrabbiare, ha detto. Entrambi i suoi genitori sono tra quelli. \u201cNon se lo meritavano. Prima \u00e8 morto mio padre. Poi mia madre\u201d, ha raccontato. \u201cVado dallo psicologo da mesi\u201d. I medici dell\u2019Ospedale Pesenti Fenaroli, che \u00e8 diventato un importante incubatore per il contagio, hanno notato un aumento di pazienti con problemi di abusi di sostanze stupefacenti. In giro per la provincia, gli psicologi parlano di una crescita dei livelli di ansia e depressione. Gli infermieri che curano quei pazienti e gli altri ammalati della provincia non ricevono pi\u00f9 diffusi gesti di affetto. \u201cNon \u00e8 pi\u00f9 come prima\u201d, ha spiegato Katia Marcassoli, infermiera del Pesenti Fenaroli. Le persone hanno smesso di telefonare per esprimere solidariet\u00e0 e per chiedere come stavano. Adesso invece, i pazienti chiamano arrabbiati per lamentarsi di essersi visti cancellare degli appuntamenti per altri problemi medici. \u201cC\u2019\u00e8 tanta rabbia\u201d. L\u2019emergenza medica ha costretto Giovanni Cagnoni a rimandare i controlli per il suo mal di stomaco. Quando i medici lo hanno visitato in via preliminare, hanno scoperto un cancro raro, il liposarcoma, concentrato intorno ai reni. Quando \u00e8 riuscito a fissare una data per l\u2019operazione, ad agosto, il cancro era in metastasi e non era pi\u00f9 operabile. \u201cGli ospedali non prendevano nessuno\u201d, ha raccontato nella sua casa di Gazzaniga, seduto di fronte al focolare con le sue due figlie. La famiglia Cagnoni aveva gi\u00e0 attraversato l\u2019inferno, i cui minimi dettagli sono stati annotati meticolosamente dall\u2019ex comandante dei carabinieri di 76 anni, in un quaderno verde dal titolo \u201cCronache del Covid-19\u201d. L\u20198 marzo sua moglie, Maddalena Peracchi, aveva sentito un brivido di freddo mentre camminava. Nei successivi undici giorni, le \u00e8 venuta la febbre (37,4- 36,5 - 38) e poi il 19 marzo il suo stato di salute \u00e8 peggiorato rapidamente e una squadra di medici e infermieri in camici protettivi \u00e8 scesa da un\u2019ambulanza, entrata in casa loro e l\u2019ha portata via. Il 20 marzo, suo fratello li ha chiamati per incoraggiarli, \u201ced \u00e8 morto la sera stessa\u201d. Il 29 marzo, il signor Cagnoni annota \u201cCambio dell\u2019ora\u201d e che i medici hanno chiamato per dirgli che sua moglie si stava spegnendo. Il 30 marzo \u00e8 \u201cinterminabile\u201d, ha scritto, non ha ricevuto nessuna notizia. Il 31 marzo ha chiamato l\u2019ospedale e ha scoperto che sua moglie era morta la notte precedente. \u201cSi erano dimenticati di chiamarci\u201d, ha scritto con la sua penna blu. L\u201911 aprile, mentre sua figlia Monia stava guarendo dal virus, il signor Cagnoni ha annotato il suo primo mal di stomaco. Cos\u00ec tante famiglie hanno perso i loro cari che quando Bergamo \u00e8 emersa da un lockdown di mesi all\u2019inizio dell\u2019estate, molte persone hanno scoperto che i loro amici e i loro vicini di casa erano scomparsi. Ma c\u2019era anche un desiderio palpabile di andare avanti. Padre Cella ha organizzato un campo estivo. I bambini hanno giocato davanti agli irrigatori del comune di Nembro. E anche se la paura aleggiava nell\u2019aria come le goccioline velenose, le persone nella citt\u00e0 di Bergamo tentavano di uscire di casa. A luglio in piazza Pontida, dove i cartelli \u201cNoi Siamo Bergamo\u201d sventolavano con aria di sfida dagli edifici, Roberta Pedretti, 52 anni, \u00e8 uscita per un aperitivo con altri infermieri con cui era diventata amica durante la guerra di trincea dell\u2019emergenza. Si \u00e8 guardata intorno, ha guardato le persone che riempivano i bar e i ristoranti. \u201cBergamo prova a vivere di nuovo ma \u00e8 piena di paura\u201d, ha detto allora. \u201cHa visto troppi cadaveri. Non pu\u00f2 essere pi\u00f9 come prima\u201d. In autunno, i casi sono esplosi di nuovo e a novembre il coprifuoco ha spento le piccole scintille di vita sociale. La funicolare e le scale tortuose che portano alla cittadina medievale in cima alla collina erano deserte. I ristoranti chiusi. Le auto di pattuglia proiettavano la luce blu delle sirene sui muri di pietra mentre si assicuravano che non ci fossero assembramenti per strada. I cartelli \u201cNoi Siamo Bergamo\u201d erano rovinati, strappati dal vento e dalla pioggia. Emma Bubola ha contribuito a questo articolo da Bergamo e da Roma.",

    "article_text": "Bergamo\u2019s Pandemic Survivors Carry Scars Unseen and Incalculable NEMBRO, Italy \u2014 Every Monday night in the northern Italian town that had perhaps the highest coronavirus death rate in all of Europe, a psychologist specializing in post-traumatic stress leads group therapy sessions in the local church. \u201cShe has treated survivors of war,\u201d the Rev. Matteo Cella, the parish priest of the town, Nembro, in Bergamo province, said of the psychologist. \u201cShe says the dynamic is the same.\u201d First the virus exploded in Bergamo. Then came the shell shock. The province that first gave the West a preview of the horrors to come \u2014 oxygen-starved grandparents, teeming hospitals and convoys of coffins rolling down sealed-off streets \u2014 now serves as a disturbing postcard from the post-traumatic aftermath. In small towns where many know one another, there is apprehension about other people, but also survivor\u2019s guilt, anger, second thoughts about fateful decisions and nightmares about dying wishes unfulfilled. There is a pervasive anxiety that, with the virus surging anew, Bergamo\u2019s enormous sacrifice will soon recede into history, that its towns will be forgotten battlefields from the great first wave, that its dead will become engraved names on another rusted plaque. And most of all there is a collective grappling to understand how the virus has changed people. Not just their antibodies, but their selves. \u201cIt has closed me more,\u201d Monia Cagnoni, 41, who lost her mother to the virus and then developed pneumonia, said as she sat apart from her father and sister on the stairs of their family home. \u201cI want to be more alone.\u201d Her sister, Cinzia, 44, who prepared coffee and cake in the kitchen, had the opposite impulse. \u201cI need people more than ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be alone.\u201d Bergamo, like everywhere, now confronts a second wave of the virus. But its sacrifice has left it better prepared than most places, as the widespread infection rate of the first wave has conferred a measure of immunity for many, doctors say. And its medical staff, by now drilled in the virus\u2019s awful protocols, are taking in patients from outside the province to alleviate the burdens on overwhelmed hospitals nearby. But even as contagion still threatens them from without, the wounds of the first wave gnaw at them from within. Talking about these things does not come easily to people in Italy\u2019s industrial heartland, jammed with metal-mechanic and textile factories, paper mills, billowing smokestacks and gaping warehouses. They prefer to talk about how much they work. Almost apologetically they reveal that they are hurting. In the town of Osio Sopra, Sara Cagliani, 30, can\u2019t get over her failure to fulfill her father\u2019s dying wish. A sign on her home\u2019s gate reads, \u201cHere lives an Alpine soldier.\u201d When the coronavirus crisis began, her father, Alberto Cagliani, 67, offered his help, telling his daughter, \u201c\u2018Remember, I\u2019m an Alpine soldier, and we show up in an emergency.\u2019\u201d After retiring as a truck driver, he had volunteered for a funeral home, driving around the province, retrieving the bodies of men killed in auto accidents and dressing them in suits given by their families. In February, he volunteered again, but this time the body count was overwhelming. He became taciturn and stopped coming home to eat. \u201cA slaughter without end,\u201d he told his daughter. On March 13, after tending to another victim, he felt a pain in his right shoulder that spread to his lower back. His voice weakened. The sound of the television bothered him. On March 21, his wife saw him touching the bathroom towels just to see if he could feel them. His fingertips had gone numb. His legs followed. He died of Covid the next day with water in his lungs. His last wish was to be buried in his Alpine soldier\u2019s uniform, and his daughter sought to honor that, sending the green jacket and pants to the funeral home. The morticians sent them back, explaining that the fear of contagion made dressing bodies impossible. \u201cTo put him in a sack, this is my greatest regret,\u201d Ms. Cagliani said through tears, adding that she had started seeing a psychologist and that the tragedy had changed many in her close-knit town. \u201cPeople are scared to see one another,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lack of affection, of touching and holding.\u201d Others are haunted by the horrible choices the virus forced them to make. In the middle of March, Laura Soliveri began taking care of her mother who had developed Covid symptoms in the Bergamo town of Brignano Gera d\u2019Adda. The doctors told her they didn\u2019t have masks and would not come check on her. Her brother, a pharmacist, warned her not to allow their mother to be taken by an ambulance or be brought to a hospital, because the family would never see her again. Ms. Soliveri, a 58-year-old grade-school teacher, scoured the area for available oxygen tanks to slake her gasping mother\u2019s thirst for air. Finally they found her one. Her mother improved. Then Ms. Soliveri\u2019s husband, Gianni Pala, got the virus, too. She and her family scrambled to find more oxygen, this time for him. They couldn\u2019t take it away from her mother. His condition deteriorated and he required hospitalization. He died, age 64, on April 5. Her mother, 85, survived. \u201cMy mother had the oxygen but we couldn\u2019t take it from her to give to him,\u201d said Ms. Soliveri, who has also started seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants and fiddling with her husband\u2019s wedding ring, which she now wears on her middle finger. \u201cI would have done it.\u201d The virus has tested some people\u2019s faith \u2014 Ms. Soliveri has said she had lost her ability to pray \u2014 and fortified it in others. Over the summer, Raffaella Mezzetti, 48, a volunteer for the Catholic charity Caritas, said the church had become a balm for the traumatized. But she said she still got chills when she heard the jingles of the ads that were on TV at the time. The sirens of ambulances, which she said were maybe bringing women to the hospital to give birth, made her nervous. \u201cIt sticks with you,\u201d she said. On the Day of the Dead in Nembro, a volunteer pressed sanitizer onto the hands of hundreds of bereaved entering the cemetery to listen to Father Cella. Delia Morotti, 57, who contracted the virus herself, left the Mass early. She said hearing the names of all the dead infuriated her. Both her parents were among them. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve this. First my father died. And then my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a psychologist for months.\u201d Others have found more self-destructive ways to cope. Doctors at the Pesenti Fenaroli hospital, which served as a critical incubator for the contagion, said they had seen a spike in patients for substance abuse issues. Around the province, psychologists have reported a rise in anxiety and depression. The nurses taking care of those patients and the province\u2019s other sick are no longer the objects of outpourings of affection. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it used to be,\u201d said Katia Marcassoli, a nurse at Pesenti Fenaroli. People had stopped calling the nurses to express solidarity and to ask how they were coping. Instead patients called with anger about their appointments canceled for other procedures. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger.\u201d The medical crisis delayed Giovanni Cagnoni from getting his stomach pains checked out. When doctors properly examined him, they discovered he had a rare cancer, liposarcoma, concentrated around his kidneys. By the time he got a surgery date, in August, it had metastasized and was no longer operable. \u201cThe hospitals weren\u2019t taking anyone,\u201d he said in his home in Gazzaniga, where he sat in front of a fire with his two daughters. The Cagnoni family had already been through an inferno, the minutiae of which the 76-year-old former military police commander punctiliously noted in a green notebook titled \u201cChronicle of Covid-19.\u201d On March 8, his wife, Maddalena Peracchi, felt a chill on a walk. Over the next 11 days, he registered her fevers (99.32, 97.7, 100.4) and then on March 19 her condition plummeted and a team of ambulance workers in hazmat suits entered their home and took her away. On March 20, her brother called to encourage them \u201cand died that evening.\u201d On March 29, Mr. Cagnoni noted \u201cDaylight Saving Time\u201d and that doctors had called to tell him his wife\u2019s time had all but expired. March 30 was \u201cinterminable,\u201d he wrote, and he received no news. On March 31, he called the hospital and learned his wife had died the night before. \u201cThey forgot to call us,\u201d the blue script reads. On April 11, as his daughter Monia recovered from the virus, Mr. Cagnoni\u2019s diary noted his first stomachache. So many families had lost relatives that when Bergamo came out of the monthslong lockdown in the summer, many people discovered that their friends and neighbors had vanished. But there was also a palpable desire to move on. Father Cella ran a summer camp. Children played in front of the sprinklers at Nembro\u2019s town hall. And even as fear lurked in the air like poisonous droplets, people in the capital city of Bergamo tentatively ventured out. In July in Piazza Pontida, where \u201cWe Are Bergamo\u201d signs hung defiantly from the buildings, Roberta Pedretti, 52, went out for an aperitif with other nurses with whom she had become close during the trench warfare of the crisis.  She looked around at the people filling the bars and restaurants. \u201cBergamo is trying to come back but it\u2019s full of fear,\u201d she said then. \u201cIt saw too many cadavers. It can\u2019t be like before.\u201d In the autumn, cases exploded again, and in November a curfew snuffed out Bergamo\u2019s flickers of social life. The funicular railway and the winding staircase that led up to the medieval hilltop town were both deserted. The restaurants were closed. Patrol cars threw blue siren light on the stone walls as they monitored the streets for gatherings. The \u201cWe Are Bergamo\u201d signs had turned weather-beaten and torn.

    "article_text": "New York City prepares to reopen elementary schools amid surge. About 190,000 students in New York City are set to return to classrooms this week, starting with elementary school students on Monday, following a monthslong roller coaster of changes to the most closely watched school reopening effort in the country. Students with complex disabilities will be able to return to school buildings on Wednesday. Mayor Bill de Blasio became the first big-city mayor in the country to reopen public schools this fall. But he closed the system briefly last month after virus cases surged in the city, before announcing that classrooms would again open for about 20 percent of the overall school system. It is not yet clear when middle and high schools will reopen. The vast majority of the city\u2019s roughly 1.1 million students have chosen to learn from home indefinitely. Classrooms are reopening amid an alarming increase in virus transmission in New York City: The city reported on Sunday that the average test positivity rate has exceeded 5 percent; it was below 3 percent just a few weeks ago. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s decision to reopen schools for young children is the most high-profile example of a national and international trend of welcoming elementary school students back into classrooms, while their older peers learn remotely. Public health experts and educators generally agree that in-person learning for young children is relatively safe and particularly crucial for their development. The mayor has said he will try to keep the school system open even if virus cases continue to rise, though it is likely that many classrooms and schools will temporarily close in the coming weeks as positive cases are confirmed in individual schools.",

    "article_text": "Residents of nursing homes could receive vaccine by the end of December, official says. Trump administration officials on Sunday laid out an ambitious timetable for the rollout of the first coronavirus vaccine in the United States, rebuking President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s criticism that there was \u201cno detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen\u201d for getting people immunized. Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the administration\u2019s program to develop and deploy vaccines, said that residents of long-term care facilities will receive the first round of vaccinations by mid-January, perhaps even by the end of December. In some states, this group accounts for about 40 percent of deaths from the coronavirus. The timing assumes that the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the vaccine, made by Pfizer, this week or shortly thereafter. An advisory committee to the agency will meet on Thursday to review the data on safety and efficacy. Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, on Sunday predicted authorization \u201cwithin days\u201d of the meeting. \u201cIf things are on track, the advisory committee goes well, I believe we could see F.D.A. authorization within days,\u201d Mr. Azar said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to go according to F.D.A. gold-standard processes.\u201d When it comes to distribution, he voiced concern for elderly populations and minorities, but noted, \u201cOur governors make the call at the end of the day on whom they will prioritize.\u201d If the agency authorizes the vaccine, distribution could begin as soon as the end of this week, Dr. Slaoui, the Operation Warp Speed adviser, said. \u201cBy end of the month of January, we should already see quite a significant decrease in mortality in the elderly population,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Barring unexpected problems with manufacturing the vaccine, most Americans at high risk from coronavirus infection should be vaccinated by mid-March, and the rest of the population by May or June, he added. President-elect Biden sounded a considerably more skeptical note on Friday, saying that there was \u201cno detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen, anyway, as to how you get the vaccine out of a container, into an injection syringe, into somebody\u2019s arm.\u201d Dr. Slaoui said his team expected to meet Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers this week and brief them on details of the plan for the vaccines\u2019 distribution. Britain has already approved the Pfizer vaccine and expects to begin immunizing its population this week. Like the F.D.A., European regulators are still examining data on the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. A second vaccine, made by Moderna, also has been submitted to the F.D.A. for emergency authorization. Dr. Slaoui was optimistic about long-term protection from the vaccine. The elderly or people with compromised immune systems might need a booster in three to five years, he said, but for most people the vaccine should remain effective for \u201cmany, many years.\u201d Still, it\u2019s unclear whether those who have been immunized may still spread the virus to others. \u201cThe answer to that very important question\u201d should be known by mid-February, he said. Up to 15 percent of those receiving the shots experience \u201csignificant, not overwhelming\u201d pain at the injection site, which usually disappears in a day or two, Dr. Slaoui told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d also on Sunday. Operation Warp Speed was expected to have 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by December, a number that has since been slashed by more than half. Although the clinical trials were completed faster than expected because of the high level of virus transmission in the United States, manufacturing problems scaled down the expected number of available doses to 40 million. Safeguarding the vaccines are another matter, as the former U.S. cyber chief warned of attempts by several U.S. adversaries to steal intellectual property related to the vaccine. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have all been found to have been involved in \u201csome kind of espionage or spying, trying to get intellectual property related to the vaccine,\u201d said Christopher Krebs, who was until recently director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Speaking on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Krebs said that in his tenure, C.I.S.A. staff had been working on looking for \u201ccritical weak spots\u201d in vaccine makers\u2019 supply chains and public health institutions.",

    "article_text": "\u2018Existential Peril\u2019: Mass Transit Faces Huge Service Cuts Across U.S. In Boston, transit officials warned of ending weekend service on the commuter rail and shutting down the city\u2019s ferries. In Washington, weekend and late-night metro service would be eliminated and 19 of the system\u2019s 91 stations would close. In Atlanta, 70 of the city\u2019s 110 bus routes have already been suspended, a move that could become permanent. And in New York City, home to the largest mass transportation system in North America, transit officials have unveiled a plan that could slash subway service by 40 percent and cut commuter rail service in half. Across the United States, public transportation systems are confronting an extraordinary financial crisis set off by the pandemic, which has starved transit agencies of huge amounts of revenue and threatens to cripple service for years. The profound cuts agencies are contemplating could hobble the recoveries of major cities from New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco, where reliable transit is a lifeblood of the local economies. Trains and buses carry the office workers, shoppers and tourists who will help revive stores, restaurants, cultural attractions, hotels and other key businesses that have been battered by the outbreak. The financial collapse of transportation agencies would especially hurt minority and low-income riders who tend to be among the biggest users of subways and buses. For months, transit officials around the country have pleaded for help from the federal government, but with no new lifeline forthcoming and many systems facing December deadlines to balance their budgets, agencies have started to outline doomsday service plans that would take effect next year. A glimmer of hope emerged in recent days, when a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress proposed $15 billion for public transit agencies as part of a $908 billion framework for a pandemic-relief package. The plan, which President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he supports, would provide nearly half of the $32 billion that transit leaders have lobbied for in recent months and that is intended to provide short-term relief. But it has yet to be endorsed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, who has proposed a smaller stimulus plan that contains no financing for public transit. On Friday, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and a Democrat, expressed optimism that a compromise deal could be achieved before the end of the year. Even if they receive some aid, transit agencies in some large cities have experienced such severe financial losses that officials say they will be forced to pare back service to save operating funds while serving riderships that are far below normal levels. It is unclear whether ridership will ever fully return to pre-pandemic levels even after effective vaccines become widely available. Some commuters may end up working from home permanently; others may abandon public transit if cuts cause service to deteriorate. \u201cThis is existential peril,\u201d said Ben Fried, a spokesman for TransitCenter, an advocacy group. \u201cThe economic rationale for cities is that people are in close proximity and can do a lot of things without spending a lot of time traveling from place to place,\u201d Mr. Fried said. \u201cIf the transit network is seriously diminished in a dozen or so cities that are a focal point for a large share of the nation\u2019s economic output, then that\u2019s going to have severe impacts on the national economy.\u201d Since the pandemic swept across America in the spring, bringing urban life to a standstill and ushering in new work-from-home norms, nearly all of the sources of money that public transit relies on have been pummeled. Ridership, and fare revenue along with it, vanished practically overnight after lockdown orders were enacted. As the economy slid into recession, the sales and income tax revenue used to finance many transit networks plunged. And cities and states sunk into their own financial crises, threatening government subsidies for public transit systems. New York City\u2019s transit agency, which is grappling with the biggest losses of any system in the country, forecasts a $6.1 billion deficit next year. Officials in Boston are dealing with a $600 million budget hole, and Chicago\u2019s agency anticipates a $500 million shortfall. By September, nationwide ridership on mass transit had crept back to nearly 40 percent of its pre-pandemic levels from a low of 19 percent in April, according to the American Public Transportation Association, a lobbying group. But the numbers have plateaued in recent weeks as the virus surges throughout the country, making this the longest and most severe period of suppressed ridership for any of the nation\u2019s public transit systems. In New York, ridership is at 30 percent of pre-pandemic levels, while on rail lines in Washington and San Francisco, it is below 15 percent of its usual levels. \u201cThe effect on ridership in each of our agencies \u2014 subway, buses, Metro-North, Long Island Railroad \u2014 is dramatically worse than even in the Great Depression,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City\u2019s subway and buses and two commuter railroads.  Many big city systems rely on fare revenue more heavily than their counterparts in smaller cities and rural areas and have tended to get a smaller share of federal support relative to their size. Fares contribute 70 percent of the operating budget in San Francisco, 40 percent in New York and Washington and about 33 percent in Boston. There is no legislative text yet for the bipartisan proposal that Republican and Democratic Senators are now negotiating, nor are there specifics for how the transit aid would be divided among agencies. \u201cThis is not limited to big, urban cities and states \u2014 lots of rural areas depend on buses that also get federal funding \u2014 so it has some degree of bipartisan support,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said in an interview. \u201cBut there are some who have never wanted any federal help for mass transit and that\u2019s who we are up against.\u201d The stimulus package that is being negotiated is likely to face opposition from some liberal lawmakers who consider it insufficient and some conservatives who are unwilling to add to the national debt. \u201cThe real answer to the economic problems is to get rid of what causes the economic problems and they\u2019re caused by economic dictates from governors that forbid commercial activity,\u201d Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not for borrowing any more money.\u201d When transit agencies have faced financial shortfalls in the past, they have typically turned to city and state governments or they have lobbied elected officials for new sources of revenue like dedicated taxes. But many municipal and state governments are grappling with their own financial problems, forcing transit agencies to look to Washington. \u201cUnlike some other transit properties, we don\u2019t have our own revenue source, we have two sources of revenue, it\u2019s either the farebox or the subsidies from our local and state government,\u201d said Paul J. Wiedefeld, the general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. \u201cThey are both under tremendous financial distress right now, so where do we turn?\u201d Many urban transit systems have exhausted the money they got from an earlier federal stimulus bill and have also imposed service cuts. In New York, overnight subway service has been suspended since May. In Los Angeles, bus service has been slashed nearly 30 percent and rail service has also been cut. And the Bay Area Rapid Transit rail system in San Francisco has ended late night service and pushed wait times for trains from 15 to 30 minutes. The cuts have helped stabilize operations and allowed them to continue providing at least limited service. But officials warn that the cutbacks could become permanent and that more could be added at the beginning of next year, a devastating prospect for the essential workers and low-wage riders who continue to rely on public transit. Around 2.8 million American workers in essential industries like health care, grocery stores and pharmacies used public transit to get to work in 2018, according to an analysis of census data by the TransitCenter. That was 36 percent of all transit commuters in the U.S. work force that year, the group said. \u201cWe have been the ones that have kept the economy of this country afloat because we do not have the luxury to work from home,\u201d said Mayra Romero, 43, a restaurant worker in Boston who travels by bus from her home in nearby Chelsea, Mass. \u201cWe have been the ones who have been risking our lives and exposing ourselves.\u201d Margaret Dunn, who lives in Clinton, Md. and works at a hotel in Washington, used to work until midnight before she was laid off in March. Now, as she waits for a call to return to her job, she worries that service cuts could leave her with few travel options once her shift ends. \u201cWe direly need some help.\u201d she said, adding that she may have to rely on Uber or her husband to drive her. In Washington, transit officials say that if the system receives sufficient federal assistance they will revive service as much as possible to help coax riders back as vaccines are distributed and the cadence of normal life begins to return. But in other cities, additional federal aid may not guarantee the return of service. In Boston, New York and San Francisco, transit officials have said they plan to recalibrate service to match what they expect to be long-lasting, depressed levels of ridership. \u201cWith the first tranche of money we got, we immediately put it in place to plug the budget gap because there was so much uncertainty, but as a consequence that money will run out this fiscal year,\u201d said Steve Poftak, the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which serves the Boston area. \u201cWe want to do as much as we can in this period of low ridership so we have a reserve in place that we can apply to fiscal year 2022.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been our approach,\u201d he added. \u201cPreserve our service now, but also keep an eye toward the future.\u201d Transit experts worry that with more cuts public transportation agencies could plunge into a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d where increasingly unreliable service keeps riders away, pushing systems deeper into financial distress. With public health officials expecting the distribution of vaccines to begin early next year, agencies could wind up cutting service just as riders return to their commutes. \u201cTransit is not going to be there for people at the exact moment they are ready for transit again,\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. \u201cWe are looking at millions of people getting ready to head back to their workplaces and the thing they relied on to get there won\u2019t be reliable anymore.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane and Aishvarya Kavi from Washington, and Pranshu Verma from New Orleans.",

It hugs her body as she moves about the stage, lip-syncing love songs in Spanish to a room filled mostly with absence. It is late on March 9, and Yimel Alvarado is at her regular Monday gig, a nightclub above a Mexican restaurant in the Corona section of Queens. This is where she feels at home, where the usually robust crowds of gay and transgender patrons applaud her teasing banter. Drink up, she often says, as fans toss money at her feet. The night is getting away. But Yimel is not herself tonight; hasn\u2019t been for days. Her Cleopatra-like eyeliner only accentuates the exhaustion in her gaze. Just a cold, she says. At some point, the concerned bar owner reaches for the tequila. The two friends knock back shots while, nearby, a few spare patrons kiss and huddle for cellphone selfies. The same denial and dread hover over the densely populated neighborhoods beyond the restaurant\u2019s door, inside apartments subdivided by drywall and need, up and down the bustle of Roosevelt Avenue. In one building, an immigrant from Ecuador worries about the many relatives living in her cramped apartment, including her frail parents. A family member, her brother-in-law, has a persistent cough. In another, a couple from Bangladesh gets a call from their daughter in her Ivy League dorm, who warns that they risk illness by going to work and sharing close air with strangers \u2014 her mother at La Guardia Airport, her father in his yellow cab. She begs them to stay home. They do not. But an Uber driver is so haunted by the coughing of two recent passengers that he has stopped picking up fares. Thirty years ago in Nepal, he fled his life as a Buddhist monk, tossing his red robe under a tree. Now he prays as he disinfects his black Toyota. Around the corner, a Thai chef who commutes by subway to Manhattan has been sending worried texts from work to his less-concerned partner at home. He frets about the growing number of confirmed cases in the United States. Is it here? The deadly coronavirus? At Elmhurst Hospital a short walk away, an emergency-room doctor has noticed a surge of patients with flulike symptoms. Now there is confirmation of what she and her colleagues knew was inevitable: the hospital\u2019s first case of Covid-19, the life-threatening illness caused by the coronavirus. It is here. But messages conflict. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has declared a state of emergency, while President Trump continues to downplay the virus. A \u201ccontainment area\u201d is about to be established in the small city of New Rochelle, while a dozen miles south the hurried hustle of Manhattan flows uninterrupted. Soon, this pinpoint on the map of Queens, where so many cultures converge, will become the global epicenter of the kind of health crisis not seen in the United States in a century. Very soon. For now, the weary-eyed Yimel Alvarado continues her performance, fortified by little more than the dose of tequila. Determined but unwell, she mouths a ballad in which a woman addresses the wife of her lover. Ahora es tarde, se\u00f1ora Ahora es tarde, se\u00f1ora Too late now, se\u00f1ora. Just about two miles separate the 69th and 103rd Street stops on the 7 train in northern Queens. Yet beneath its elevated tracks sprawls the world.

To walk down Roosevelt Avenue now is to journey from the Himalayan peaks to the arid Mexican plains, to hear the music of intermingled languages and dialects, all within three dozen short blocks. In the perpetual dusk cast by the subway tracks above, vendors sell woven baskets from Ecuador and leather sandals from Mexico, while Indian grocers display their produce and men carry skinned goats to halal butchers. Dentists and doctors offer their services from narrow storefronts, as do self-proclaimed healers, the curanderos, found among the statues and candles in religious-goods stores, available for counsel. The lively rhythms of the street follow the percussive beat of cumbia, the thump of reggaeton, the call to prayer. Fueling it all is an international buffet of the sizzling meat tacos of southern Mexico, the steamed dumplings of Nepal, the Indian curries, the Peruvian ceviche, the Colombian bu\u00f1uelos. And everywhere, people. Many work the service jobs that animate the city: driving, cleaning, cooking, building \u2014 up at first light to line the subway platforms, hard hats and coffee cups in hand. Many are distrustful of authorities, or vulnerable to exploitation, or simply too afraid to call in sick. By the tens of thousands, they spill from brick tenements with narrow courtyards, from small houses with grapevine gardens, from basement quarters with little natural light. If lucky, they live with family or friends; if not, they live among strangers, paying for a bed or maybe just a couch. Imperfect conditions for social distancing. Perfect for contagion. \u2014 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York Yimel Alvarado lies sick in the gloom of her tiny bedroom, a crucifix on the wall above her head. Pink satin curtains are drawn against the late-afternoon light, five days after her cabaret performance in the upstairs lounge at El Trio restaurant. Since then, a low-grade panic has taken hold in the city outside her modest Jackson Heights apartment. The subway turnstiles are being disinfected twice a day. The Diocese of Brooklyn has suspended Sunday Mass obligations for Catholics. The New York Police Department has alerted all of its precincts that Covid-19 is now categorized as a pandemic. Capt. Jonathan Cermeli, the commanding officer of the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, cannot believe the abrupt change in events. Only a week ago, at a 12th birthday party for his son, friends were discussing an issue that seemed entirely unrelated to their lives. You guys hear about this virus? Now Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared a state of emergency. His office will say it was in frequent contact with the city\u2019s hospitals and regularly briefed elected officials and the public. But two local City Council members, Francisco Moya and Daniel Dromm, complain of receiving little guidance from City Hall. \u201cWe felt like we were on our own,\u201d Mr. Moya will later say. Yimel, 40, is also on her own. Like so many undocumented immigrants, she has no health insurance, no primary-care physician to call. She has been refusing offers of help from her roommates \u2014 who see her as their nurturing mother \u2014 and has barely let on to family in Mexico that she is sick. She has relied on prayer and citrus-infused tea to treat what she has been sarcastically calling her blessed cough. But now the woman always up for a sassy selfie is not answering her phone, and her text about a cough has spooked her younger sister in the Bronx, Olivia Aldama, who senses what this means: Her beloved Chiquis is sick. Olivia, 34, finishes her shift at a dry cleaners and hurries by subway to Jackson Heights. She enters Yimel\u2019s darkened bedroom to find her sister moaning in her sleep, her cellphone buried in the sheets. Her breathing is labored, her lips parched, her tongue like white paper; she needs to go to the hospital. I\u2019m here, Olivia says, hugging her. I\u2019m here now. Olivia may not know everything about the sibling in her arms. That Yimel slept on the streets when she arrived in New York about 20 years ago. That she was a sex worker, enduring verbal and physical attacks under the elevated tracks in Jackson Heights. That she may still be. What Olivia knows is that her sister was identified at birth as a boy \u2014 a gender that Yimel later realized did not fit, but which she and her family still discuss as part of her past. Growing up in Tlapa de Comonfort, a city in the mountains of southern Mexico, the child preferred playing dress-up with the family\u2019s four daughters, incurring the wrath of their father. Tensions built up over the years until, one day, brimming with drink and shame, the man pulled out a knife and shouted, Kill yourself! The only choice was to flee. But before being spirited across the border by smugglers, the teenager joined her mother in the cool of the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City. There, the mother entrusted her own to the Virgin. The new immigrant eventually found acceptance in Jackson Heights among gay and transgender people who had also fled intolerance in Latin America, and blossomed into Yimel Alvarado, who found her calling as an entertainer in the gay clubs around Roosevelt Avenue. She has also become the bawdy, big-hearted matriarch of what is known as the Familia Alvarado, a tight-knit group whose members she has fed, clothed, counseled and often taken in. Over her apartment door hangs a sign that reassures: We Are So Good Together. In recent years, though, Yimel has been going out less, gaining weight and drinking more. She often stays here in her bedroom, creating her glamorous outfits at a sewing machine, or sketching dress designs in a notebook. She also jots down comforting aphorisms she comes across. Before giving up, try And before dying, LIVE Now, as Olivia struggles to help her sister sit up, a young Salvadoran man knocks on the door. He has been living in the apartment, sleeping on the couch, since Yimel learned that he was robbed at a homeless shelter. Together they dress and guide the delirious Yimel toward the stairs. She sits and begins to ease herself down the steps, one by one \u2014 only to stop, exhausted. A taxi is called. But the driver, suspecting that the woman slumped on the stairs has the virus, apologizes and leaves. In a fleeting moment of clarity, Yimel speaks: Call an ambulance. The ambulance carrying another possible Covid case pulls up to the trauma entrance of Elmhurst Hospital. The salmon-colored colossus traces its roots back nearly two centuries to a penitentiary hospital on what is now called Roosevelt Island, which treated the incarcerated, the poor and the neglected long before this 11-story complex opened in 1957. Others might see a drab municipal hospital short on amenities, tending to mostly the disadvantaged and uninsured. But Dr. Laura Iavicoli, 49, considers her safety-net hospital to be \u201cthe most magical place on earth,\u201d with a skilled, committed staff and a diverse mix of patients who offer fresh challenges every day. But never a challenge as daunting as this deadly virus, which first appeared late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, 7,500 miles from New York. Now it is here in Queens, where the recent confirmation of coronavirus cases at the hospital foretells dark days ahead. At first the hospital considered itself prepared, with an interactive staff exercise about the virus in late January, a series of routine drills and access to four negative-pressure isolation rooms in the emergency department. Assumptions took hold, including that the virus would behave like other contagious diseases the hospital had prepared for but never seen, such as Ebola. But assumptions are toppling. Influenza-like illnesses are rampant, while coronavirus cases are ticking up. And with access to testing severely limited, doctors are sending many patients, including some who may have Covid, home to isolate. Hospital administrators are researching the 1918 influenza pandemic, communicating with medical experts around the world and meeting every night in a conference room to review models and statistics. But Dr. Iavicoli has become convinced that this virus cannot be outsmarted. The hospital\u2019s initial isolation plan \u2014 based on protocols from several countries and agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control \u2014 hinged on yet another assumption: that the coronavirus reveals itself with fever, coughing and respiratory distress. Now doctors are realizing that diarrhea and malaise can also indicate Covid, which means that some contagious patients may have been inadvertently missed. Every day, more emergency department space needs to be repurposed as isolation zones. The area reserved for treating coughs and minor cuts is now Covid. The critical care area, originally with seven beds, will soon have 20, all for Covid. Green oxygen hoses snake across the floor, while blue air-filter hoses rise to the ceiling. Sick people cluster at the entrance, slouch in chairs, lie on stretchers along the dull pink walls. Now paramedics in protective suits wheel in another: Yimel Alvarado. She is placed on a bed in the hallway, next to a young woman holding her stomach and crying out in agony. Briefly snapped from her delirium, Yimel looks over with evident compassion, but soon she is gone again, speaking in the language of hallucination as she stares at the hospital monitors in the corridor: That\u2019s why I don\u2019t watch television. They keep changing the channel. Without the oxygen she received in the ambulance, Yimel becomes weaker. A sip of water causes her to convulse in coughs, sending Olivia running for help. A nurse rushes over to check the oxygenation of Yimel\u2019s blood. Several hospital workers are soon gathered around Yimel. First in English, then in Spanish, they ask: Have you traveled? Have you had a cough? Have you had a high fever? For how long? Olivia repeats the answers she heard her sister give to paramedics in the ambulance: No. Yes. Yes. Four days. Yimel is wheeled beyond a set of glass doors. Hours later, a doctor emerges to inform Olivia that her sister is in critical condition with pneumonia and would be dead if she hadn\u2019t been brought to the hospital. Five days ago, Yimel was performing at a nightclub; now she is in intensive care. By morning she will be unconscious, intubated and encased in a plastic tent. Earlier on this Saturday, Mr. Trump asserted that the country\u2019s relatively low number of coronavirus-related deaths \u2014 about 50 so far, he said \u2014 was because of \u201ca lot of good decisions.\u201d Tomorrow he will describe the virus as \u201csomething that we have tremendous control of.\u201d But these upbeat assertions belie what is being experienced at Elmhurst Hospital, where Covid cases and flulike illnesses continue their ominous rise. Near midnight, Dr. Iavicoli talks by phone with two other emergency department supervisors, Dr. Stuart Kessler and Dr. Phillip Fairweather, to assess the damage of another harrowing day. Dr. Iavicoli, who has expertise in emergency management, recommends an aggressive requirement that emergency department staff wear full personal protective equipment \u2014 gown, gloves, goggles and N95 mask \u2014 at all times. The three doctors agree. Now the entire department is officially a \u201chot zone,\u201d based on a new assumption: Everyone is likely to have Covid. \u2014 President Trump A stillness settles over the city. Events by which New York measures time \u2014 the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade, for one \u2014 have been canceled. Schools for more than a million students are closed. Religious services are suspended. Transit hubs are empty. Skyscrapers are vacant. Broadway is dark. Coursing through the quiet is a palpable anxiety, a collective bracing for the blow to come. In the upstairs apartment of a two-family house in Woodside, Dawa Sherpa, the Uber driver from Nepal, tries to scrub away what he cannot see but fears is present. He cleans the stairwell, where the shoes of his three sons, 18, 13 and 6, form a neat row up the steps. He cleans the bedrooms, the kitchen and the living room, which features a torn map of the subway system and a large Buddhist shrine with three key figures: Shakyamuni Buddha, Guru Rinpoche and Chenrezig. On the altar sit seven silver bowls that are filled with water in the morning and emptied at night, a silver chalice brimming with an offering of amber-colored tea \u2014 and a large bottle of hand sanitizer. Dawa is 50, short and husky, his black hair flecked with gray. Born in a speck of a farming village on a mountaintop in the Himalayas, he moved with his family to Kathmandu, then was sent at the age of 10 to a Buddhist monastery, where life became a spiritual boot camp of prayer, chores and study. Failure to know one\u2019s lessons could result in a beating. When he was about 20, he jumped over a monastery wall to see what was going on in the world. He never returned. The former monk traveled to China to help his father\u2019s import business, then to Japan, where he worked at a Toyota factory, and then, in 1996, to the United States, which he understood to be \u201ca freedom country.\u201d He gravitated toward Jackson Heights, married Sita Rai, a woman he had met at a wedding in Kathmandu, and began assembling a familiar immigrant r\u00e9sum\u00e9: clerk in a school-supply store; cook in a Chinese restaurant; driver for a manufacturing firm; delivery man for Domino\u2019s Pizza; taxi driver, working a 12-hour overnight shift. Four years ago, Dawa switched to driving for Uber, shuttling customers around the tristate area in his black Toyota S.U.V. In recent weeks, he has listened constantly to the news radio station 1010 WINS in his car for updates on the pandemic\u2019s progression. Then, two weeks ago, two customers coughed in his back seat. He drove home and systematically wiped down the seats, the door handles, everything, in mists of Lysol spray. He hasn\u2019t driven for Uber since. And it may be a trick of the mind, but Dawa does not feel 100 percent. Not a half-mile away, dozens of families flock to a commercial stretch along 73rd Street, a few steps from Roosevelt Avenue. This is the Little Bangladesh section of Jackson Heights, a medley of groceries, restaurants and shops that cater to immigrants from Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet. Gone for now are the days when men discussed news events in Bengali over samosas and tea, while women browsed the saris in the boutiques and children made difficult selections in the sweet shops. Gone is the sleepy air, redolent of spices. Instead, uneasiness has set in, as people mill together in a determined search for food and supplies. With schools closed, children will be staying home, taking classes online for who knows how long. So mothers heap bags of rice and tins of oil into the family cars, while fathers carry out slabs of meat to store in newly bought freezers, as if stocking up for a lengthy siege. All around, people are falling sick. A sergeant who analyzes crime statistics for Captain Cermeli at the 110th precinct. A jeweler who helps to run a soccer league in Corona. The pastor of St. Bartholomew Roman Catholic Church in Elmhurst. Along and around 73rd Street, lines snake outside grocery stores, and some pharmacy shelves have been picked clean. The same scene is playing out in other areas nearby: Little India, Little Colombia, Little Manila. People who have known faraway conflict are steeling for war. \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York In a brick building in Corona, 11 members of an extended family from Ecuador, young and old, live in a three-bedroom apartment. Two are sick: Rosa Lema, 41, with a fever, and her brother-in-law, with a violent cough. Now, late this afternoon \u2014 on a day when Mr. Cuomo announces a shutdown for much of the state \u2014 Rosa is notified by telephone that her mother, Vicenta Flores, has fainted during a dialysis session at Elmhurst Hospital, and a family member needs to take her to the emergency room. Rosa, a petite woman with high cheekbones and sleek dark hair, spent days disinfecting the kitchen and the well-trafficked bathroom, with its shower handle for her parents to grip. She encouraged her mother, who is 77, to stay in her small room between dialysis appointments, and bought sugar-free Robitussin for diabetics to treat what she thought was her mother\u2019s minor cold. These precautions were futile. Rosa calls her brother Jorge, who lives nearby. He rushes to the hospital. It was never the plan to jam so many people into Rosa\u2019s apartment. To stuff the living room bookshelves with clothes. To pile dusty boots and sparkly children\u2019s shoes outside the front door. But a few months ago, Rosa\u2019s sister Carmen and her family appeared at her door in Red Cross blankets after losing their home in a fire. So now six adults, five children, two cats and a dog live packed together, amid the discarded baubles that Vicenta has picked up while collecting cans for deposit money, which she sends to her mother in Ecuador. Jorge calls back, worried; a line of more than 100 people is unspooling from the emergency room. Rosa tells him to alert the hospital staff that their mother is in a wheelchair, sick and listless. Soon Rosa\u2019s brother calls again, this time with a doctor who has questions. Has Vicenta had a fever? Has anyone else in the family been ill? Yes. Both Rosa and her mother have not been feeling well. But if her mother has contracted the virus, Rosa wonders where. At the dialysis clinic? During visits to another Queens hospital where her 83-year-old husband, Jos\u00e9 Redentor Lema \u2014 Rosa\u2019s father \u2014 had been recovering after complications from pancreatic surgery? What about the living room, where Vicenta sits during the day, playing with the cats or stroking her granddaughters\u2019 ponytails? At night the sofas become beds for Rosa\u2019s sister, her husband and their twins; he is a tile layer who became ill when the virus swept through his construction crew. At Elmhurst, hospital workers lift her mother onto a bed and wheel her away, leaving Jorge to take in the long trail of the sick and worried, some so depleted they are lying on the ground. Rosa thinks about their mother\u2019s toughness. Cooking corn cakes over open flames for the family in their hometown, Bibli\u00e1n. Raising six children while her husband traveled the country building roads. Then, when her children emigrated to the United States, raising some of their children. Once she was in Queens, the tiny woman, not five feet tall, learned to navigate the big-city streets as she collected cans. She even emerged from a six-week coma after being struck by a car. Ella va a estar bien. This is what Rosa will tell her siblings. She will be fine. But what will she tell her father, who has recently been moved to a rehabilitation center? He is so attached to his wife of 52 years that he always asks the same thing if she is even a minute late coming home. Where is Vicenta? Where is Vicenta? \u2014 Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, chief population health officer for New York\u2019s public hospital system A mile and a half away in Woodside, in another brick apartment building, Jack Wongserat, the chef, has shared his fears of the coronavirus with his partner, Joe Farris, who has not been as anxious. Until now. Jack has a 103-degree fever. Theirs has been a New York romance: A Thai immigrant named Jack, short and compact, meets an Alabama native named Joe, tall and thin, in a bar on the Bowery in 2005. They engage in the pro forma exchange of telephone numbers, but then Jack surprises Joe by calling. \u201cHe courted me,\u201d Joe says. In the city\u2019s close-knit community of Thai cuisine, Jack, 53, is known as exacting but nurturing: rigid about hygiene and promptness and then, after the last curried dish has been served, available for a glass of Riesling and an encouraging chat with colleagues new to America. Drawing on his own life \u2014 born in the Thai city of Ubon Ratchathani, losing both parents when he was young, emigrating in 1990 with no prospects \u2014 Jack tells them to be strong. He spins stories about his luck at casinos, and invites them to watch his beloved Giants and share spicy food he has cooked that will taste like home. They nickname him Mama. His partner, Joe, 58, grew up in the small city of Jasper and studied music at the University of Alabama. He taught English in Taiwan for a year, then moved in the early \u201990s to New York. After a long stretch waiting tables, he shifted to market research, and now works as a project manager from the apartment he has shared with Jack for two years. In one corner are Jack\u2019s small shrine to the Buddha and a mismatched collection of china for the restaurant he hopes to open one day. In another corner sits the digital piano he bought for Joe to reignite his passion for music. Now, on this Saturday morning, Jack is texting Joe from their bedroom. 11:43 a.m.: My test is positive 11:43 a.m.: Dr. said drink more water 11:45 a.m.: Take the Virus medicine 11:50 a.m.: Start separating fork spoon 11:50 a.m.: Use the mask protection 11:50 a.m.: Every time 12:07 p.m.: Sorry about that \u2014 President Trump The skies are leaden, a wintry mix falling. All in keeping with the mood of Queens. Inside Elmhurst Hospital, Vicenta Flores is on a ventilator, unconscious and alone. Visitors are not allowed, but many in her family\u2019s small apartment in Corona are too sick to see her anyway, including two grandchildren sharing a nebulizer meant for asthma. Rosa Lema, Vicenta\u2019s daughter, is so ill that she has gotten tested for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the entertainer Yimel Alvarado remains sedated and on a ventilator in her clear plastic cocoon. With the help of an English-speaking member of the Familia Alvarado, her sister Olivia has been calling twice a day to check on Yimel, whose own test result has finally come in: positive. Covid cases have all but overtaken the emergency department. Just weeks ago, the prevailing wisdom held that the hospital\u2019s four negative-pressure isolation rooms could handle whatever infectious cases came in. The thought now seems absurd. For Dr. Stuart Kessler, the emergency department\u2019s director, the days are one protracted crisis under fluorescent lights. A Queens native who grew up in Bayside, seven miles to the east, he has hound-dog eyes and a seen-it-all air earned from decades as an emergency-medicine physician in big-city hospitals. But he has never seen any disease progress like this virus, and he is urging peers around the country to reject conventional thought and prepare for something entirely unfamiliar. His words of caution do not seem to register. If you haven\u2019t lived through it, he decides, you cannot understand it. Outside the hospital, gunmetal barricades guide a trail of rain-battered people toward a testing site in a tent near the emergency department entrance. Bent beneath umbrellas, hunched against the cold, they form a daily column of dread. Francisco Moya, the local councilman, drives past the line after delivering 1,000 face masks to the hospital where he was born 46 years ago and once worked as an administrator. The son of Ecuadorean immigrants who settled in Corona, he is a familiar, bearded presence around here, having also served as a community organizer and state assemblyman. He is heart-stricken and angered by the sight of so many people, many of them uninsured immigrants, huddled in desperation. It seems like a scene from some war-torn country, not his own. As the city\u2019s confirmed cases double about every week, Mr. Moya is among those sounding the alarm. On social media and in calls to City Hall, he asserts that Elmhurst Hospital is over capacity and in dire need of doctors, nurses, ventilators and personal protective equipment. It is true: Many in Queens are in short supply of nearly everything, save despair. But dozens of local organizations are working to fill the void. A few blocks from Elmhurst Hospital, a young imam from Bangladesh is converting his mosque, An-Noor Cultural Center, into a makeshift storehouse; the prayer room\u2019s carpet will soon be covered with donated halal food. With the wizardry of his 13-year-old son, he is also posting daily videos on social media to keep his isolated congregants informed. In Woodside, an out-of-work contractor from Ecuador volunteers his services on Facebook to fellow congregants at Aliento de Vida church. \u201cMy brothers God bless you all,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf anybody is in need of supplies or has an emergency and needs transportation, I offer to take you completely for free.\u201d And in Jackson Heights, an old Lutheran church hums with assembly-line precision. The building is now a Buddhist temple and headquarters for the United Sherpa Association, a resource for immigrants from Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan. Among its members is Dawa Sherpa, the Uber driver, who is active in its youth sports program. On the second floor, where a white scarf, called a khata, is draped over a beam as a sign of welcome, volunteers are making care packages for the sick, homebound and scared. They have been scrounging round-the-clock for gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer, with members in the import business calling contacts in Asia late at night. But they cannot seem to get enough of a once-plentiful item: Tylenol. Joe Farris, who lives a short block from the Sherpa building, has been on the same quest. His partner, Jack Wongserat, is trying to stay fit during his illness, doing stretches on a blanket he has laid on the floor beside the bed. But his dry coughs are incessant. Seeking to ease Jack\u2019s pain, Joe walks the unnaturally quiet Queens streets in search of isopropyl alcohol, zinc, vitamin C tablets and Tylenol. None at the Duane Reade drugstore. None at the Walgreens. The best he can do is to secure two thermometers. Joe is also unwell. He is coughing and has lost his sense of smell, which is said to be a Covid symptom. The other day he put his wrist to his nose and could not detect his cologne. The two men at least have a plan. They wipe everything with alcohol swabs and keep separate silverware in plastic containers marked with their names. Joe sleeps in the living room. Even so, Jack seems to be thinking ahead. While Joe putters in the kitchen where Jack\u2019s spices take up four shelves, he hears his partner mutter alarming words as he shuffles past. I\u2019m not afraid of dying. I\u2019m 53. I\u2019ve had a good life. \u2014 Governor Cuomo Less than a mile to the north, in East Elmhurst, Mahdia Chowdhury is home from Cornell University and losing sleep in her family\u2019s small second-floor apartment, in the bedroom she shares with her two teenage brothers. Outside, the ambulances are so common that at night their lights paint her bedroom ceiling red. Inside, her father, Shamsul, is getting sicker by the day. A few days ago, he stopped going to his mosque and returned the yellow Toyota Prius that he leased with a partner to a taxi garage in Long Island City, as she had begged him to do because of risks to his health. Too late. Now, every night, he comes to her room to ask whether his \u201cdysentery\u201d \u2014 his term for a fever and diarrhea \u2014 means that he has Covid. No, she fibs to reassure him. You\u2019re fine. Although her parents sleep in the same bed, Mahdia is not as worried about her mother, Tarana, 47, who still works serving food and cleaning up in the United Airlines lounge at nearby La Guardia Airport. It is mostly empty now, the once-constant roar of jets overhead all but silenced. Her father is the one who concerns her. Setting aside her college assignments to research Covid symptoms, she has become convinced that he is infected and, as a diabetic and smoker, at great risk. He is 48. Just days ago, Mahdia was in the library of her hilly campus 240 miles away, cramming for midterm exams. Now she lies awake as her brothers sleep. Shamsul seems weaker. He scarcely touches the rice the family leaves outside his bedroom door, beneath a talisman of a blue eye meant to ward off evil. She thinks about their father\u2019s quiet sacrifices. In the Bangladeshi city of Sylhet, he owned land and had a master\u2019s degree. He was part of the privileged class. The earnest and meticulous Shamsul gave all this up in 2009 to provide more opportunity for his children in the United States, where, instead of managing operations at a bank in Sylhet, he took Mahdia and her brothers to school every morning in the taxi he drove 10 hours a day. He no longer seems as depressed as when they first arrived, though the family\u2019s finances remain a worry. He fears that he became a New York cabdriver a generation too late; that the taxi industry was collapsing even before the pandemic; that he and his wife may never afford a house. Now Shamsul shuffles to the bathroom in loose pajamas and flip-flops, shielding his eyes against the light. Do you think I have it? Mahdia, petite and practical, her thick black hair kept at shoulder\u2019s length, usually handles the family\u2019s paperwork, a familiar job for a first child of immigrants. She will be the one to decide what to do. Should she hold off on sending him to Elmhurst Hospital, rumored to be overrun? Or should she get him there while she can? She envisions herself frantically dialing 911 some night, only to find that all the ambulances have already been dispatched. Another squalling ambulance hurries down their block, another sick person being taken away. From her window she has seen the used rubber gloves left by paramedics on the street. \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence Jack Wongserat demands to be handed a takeout container to fill an order. He becomes annoyed when one is not made available, then sits down to dial the telephone. But there are no takeout containers. There is no telephone. Nor is he back working at a Thai restaurant in Manhattan on this cool and cloudy morning. Jack is in his Woodside apartment, in the throes of a delusion. By tonight, much of the country will be disabused of any illusions about the virus, in part because of Jack. His partner, Joe, settles him into a plush chair in their bedroom, then eases him onto the bed, hoping that he will sleep. But soon Jack is gasping for air. As Joe hurriedly turns him on his side, they both crash to the floor. Joe dials 911 and tries to follow the dispatcher\u2019s instructions for administering CPR. The ambulance, of course, seems to take forever. The paramedics hurl the tan chair onto the bed to create room, then take Jack by stretcher down to the courtyard. As five medics wheel him to the ambulance, his stomach rises and falls in frantic measure to his search for breath. Oh my dear, says a neighbor watching from her window. Oh no, oh my Lord, please bless him. Racing to Elmhurst Hospital on foot, Joe finds Jack intubated and unconscious on a bed in the controlled frenzy of the overcrowded emergency department. Beds are wheeled past, including one bearing a patient who appears to be dead. A drawn curtain in a corner provides minimal privacy for two men who have shared an Alabama-Thailand bond for 15 years. On the faint chance that Jack can hear, Joe talks. Everything is going to be OK. You\u2019re at peace. A doctor explains that a sustained loss of oxygen has caused significant and permanent brain damage. He excuses himself to allow Joe time to decide whether everything or nothing should be done to keep Jack alive. For Joe, the only option is the one Jack would want. He accepts and signs the Do Not Resuscitate form. Sitting at the bedside of his life partner, Joe loses all sense of time. At one point Jack\u2019s heartbeat becomes erratic, but a physician who rushes over is advised by a colleague not to assist: The patient is a D.N.R. Jack\u2019s heart stops. Two social workers appear by Joe\u2019s side to provide comfort and a list of funeral homes. One recommends that he make arrangements immediately, given the sudden demand. Jack Wongserat is one of 13 people to die at Elmhurst Hospital in the span of 24 hours. The hospital code for emergency intervention \u2014 \u201cTeam 700\u201d \u2014 resounds over the loudspeaker, while a recently delivered refrigerated truck hums outside, prepared to receive. The crush of patients is so great that emergency doctors and nurses are no longer donning fresh N95 masks every time they approach a new patient. It would take too long and burn through too many. An Elmhurst Hospital doctor\u2019s plea for help, conveyed in a video published by The New York Times, amplifies the increasingly grim situation. The doctor, Colleen Smith, says the emergency department is seeing 400 patients a day \u2014 nearly twice the normal complement \u2014 while supplies dwindle and crowds wait for medical assessments. \u201cThis is bad. People are dying,\u201d Dr. Smith says in the video. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them.\u201d By nightfall, the borough of Queens \u2014 and, specifically, Elmhurst Hospital \u2014 will become known as the epicenter of the pandemic in New York, if not the United States. For many Americans, the coronavirus will move from abstract threat to real-life horror. Epicenter. Over and over, the word will be repeated by the president and the governor, by newspapers and broadcasters. City officials will soon release data showing that these neighborhoods, interlocking ZIP codes containing the world, top the list of the worst-hit parts of New York. But right now there is just Joe Farris alone, walking home through the gray afternoon. He heads down 41st Avenue, past a Spanish pharmacy, a Chinese church, and the old Lutheran church where people of Sherpa heritage are assembling Covid care packages. He is in shock, his mind a jumble of every thought and no thought. All he knows for certain is that a pandemic in Queens has claimed his love. \u2014 Mayor de Blasio The day of 13 deaths at Elmhurst Hospital was difficult, horrible, tragic. But for Dr. Laura Iavicoli, an associate director of its emergency department, that was not the worst day. The worst is two days later \u2014 today. She is a self-described proud Philly girl whose shoulder-length black hair offsets her white lab coat. This is who and how she has wanted to be since elementary school, after her best friend was hit by a car and brain-injured, then saved by emergency physicians. She is also highly motivated, someone who decompresses by working toward a black belt in mixed martial arts; whose idea of relaxing is to drink Colombian coffee, extra light, while working on her laptop in a cafe. Relaxation is now a foreign concept. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, she leaves her family\u2019s Upper West Side apartment early, returns late and avoids talking about her day. No need to upset her three daughters, who are 12, 10 and 9. This morning, Dr. Iavicoli straps on her black helmet and mounts her bicycle, a red and black Fuji Oval bought for $250 a week ago by her husband. It is a replacement for the stress-reducing jogs she no longer has time for. She cycles through Central Park, over the 59th Street Bridge and into Queens, bound for her now-famous workplace. Her pride in Elmhurst Hospital remains strong, but she is witnessing the institution being tested to its limits. One of her colleagues calls the situation apocalyptic; another will liken it to Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno.\u201d Late in the afternoon, she hurries to join Dr. Kessler for another pandemic-related conference call, but on her way she is stunned by how the Covid sick have overtaken the emergency department. In beds, behind curtains, in the hall, in the waiting room, everywhere. She can barely see the pale tile floor. Forget the conference call, she tells Dr. Kessler. The two supervisors join the scrum of health care professionals working nonstop to hold a deadly virus at bay in one corner of Queens. They make bed checks, carry supplies, move patients \u2014 whatever is necessary. In this life-or-death theater, time becomes timeless. When Dr. Iavicoli recalls this night in the days to come, her tough Philly persona will break as she describes a scene simultaneously frantic and methodical, stressful and cool: a scene of people working in concert to keep others alive. Doctors adjusting ventilators. Nurses calibrating drips. Teams scurrying to monitor oxygen levels, replace tanks and reposition patients to make breathing easier. But giving it all is not always enough. Before dawn this morning, a ringing cellphone disrupts sleep in the Bronx apartment of Olivia Aldama, Yimel\u2019s sister. The caller is speaking in English, so she hands the phone to one of her teenage sons, now awake. It\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital. Yimel\u2019s blood pressure has dropped and her breathing has slowed, he says. If her heart stops, as it did a few days ago, should they try to revive her? Yes, yes, yes, Olivia says. Whatever they have to do. They hang up, and Olivia waits in the dark. She last saw her sister nearly two weeks ago, the day after Yimel was hospitalized. She had waited in vain for 12 hours, hoping for an update on Yimel\u2019s condition, before finally mustering her courage and slipping into the I.C.U. late that night. The nurses didn\u2019t even look up, which had Olivia thinking, God must have made me invisible. There was her sister, sedated in a glass-sealed room. Even with tubes curling around her face, Yimel looked dignified, her chin raised, her eyes closed beneath thin, arched eyebrows. The phone rings again. This time, a translation service for the hospital is calling to say that Yimel \u2014 her Chiquis \u2014 has died. Olivia cannot go back to sleep. In a few hours, she thinks, she will ask someone who speaks English to call the hospital back to make sure it is true. Later this morning, in a darkened bedroom in Corona, Rosa Lema lies awake in bedsheets damp from another feverish night. Her mind is spinning. Her brother-in-law, the tile layer, has just left for the hospital with severe symptoms. Rosa\u2019s test results have shown not only that she has the coronavirus, but also that she is pregnant. Weak and short of breath, she does not want to move. But from her bed she hears a sound disrupting the apartment\u2019s usual chattering hum. One of her daughters, sobbing. Rosa manages to rise and walk into the living room. Her husband, who has just lost his job in construction, is crying; he takes her in his arms. Her sister Carmen, who has just lost her job as a house cleaner, has stopped making lunch and is comforting Rosa\u2019s 9-year-old daughter. Rosa takes in the scene, and she knows. Their brother Jorge has called with devastating news: Se nos fue la vieja. We lost our old lady. The family had heard little from Elmhurst Hospital since Vicenta was admitted and intubated a week ago. There was no warning that her condition had deteriorated. No chance to say goodbye, even by video. Soon, the six children of Vicenta Flores will struggle to find a mortician to collect her body from the hospital, which is demanding that it be removed as soon as possible. They will have to have difficult video-call discussions about cremation, which, according to the consulate, is now the only way to send the remains of people who died of Covid back to Ecuador. And they will have to decide when to tell their father, Jos\u00e9, who remains at a local rehabilitation center, that his wife of a half-century is dead. But right now, everyone is crying over the loss of their Abuelita. Carmen moves to embrace Rosa, but her sister turns and heads back to her bed. Soon, from behind Rosa\u2019s door, comes the sound of weeping. It is nearly 3 in the morning when Dr. Iavicoli straps on her helmet. She guides her new bicycle out of an office, down an empty hallway and out into the stilled night. With the white tent and refrigerated truck behind her, she cycles past a Mexican grocery, a couple of Thai restaurants, a Hindu temple, a Muslim cultural center, a tax service for Spanish speakers. Queens. She knows that when she reaches her apartment, her husband will have laid out the hand sanitizer and the disinfectant wipes. She will throw her clothes in the laundry and take a hot shower. She has 50 minutes before arriving at her doorstep to leave her pandemic-filled day behind. She thinks of what went well; what could have gone better, and how. She wonders when the death and sickness will end. The doctor turns left onto Roosevelt Avenue, where the elevated subway tracks create a skeletal ceiling. She feels as if she is moving through some alternate universe. As if the great metropolis of New York were in paralytic shock. Down city thoroughfares as quiet as country roads, then onto the cantilevered 59th Street Bridge. Dr. Iavicoli can see the East River murk through the metal grates beneath her tires, then parts of Roosevelt Island, where her cherished workplace began operating nearly 200 years ago. She exits the bridge and glides as if in a dream through a silenced Manhattan. The rush of cool city air clears her mind, allows her to shed the day like a tossed lab coat. Up First Avenue. Across 66th Street. Through the darkened sanctuary of Central Park to the Upper West Side. Home. \u2014 Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dawa Sherpa has been ill for more than a week. Coughing. Lethargic. No appetite. Struggling to breathe. His wife, Sita Rai, trails after him as he shambles around their Woodside apartment, wiping whatever he touches with disinfectant. But he is so weak this evening that she calls for an ambulance. He makes his way down the gray-carpeted steps, past the descending row of the family\u2019s shoes, and is winded by the effort. Dawa is taken a half-mile to Elmhurst Hospital, which continues to develop in-the-moment protocols for what is now considered an ongoing mass-casualty event. The news last week of 13 deaths in a day has prompted an outpouring of support in donations of masks and other supplies. And, soon, patient transfers will ease the overcrowding. But the publicity has also fueled a troubling misapprehension among some local residents, based on ominous things they have seen and heard. The refrigerated truck. The wailing ambulances. The long lines. The rhythmic thump of hovering news helicopters. Word spreads that no one who enters Elmhurst Hospital comes out alive. The local rumor mill spins the 13 deaths into 15; 25; 1,000. The false information has convinced some to face Covid on their own at home, armed with little more than tea and, with any luck, Tylenol. It can be a fatal decision. But like many others, Dawa has chosen to trust the doctors at Elmhurst. He is led to a small area where others sitting in mismatched chairs draw oxygen from various devices. The hospital has no choice but to group the sick together. Some are talking in Spanish on cellphones, some cry in fear. He shares their terror. He knows that another Uber driver from Nepal, a father of three, recently died of the virus in this hospital. That man was a year younger than Dawa. The former monk is connected to an oxygen generator. To keep calm, he recites a prayer in his head that invokes and evokes the embodiment of the Buddha\u2019s compassion: Sol wa deb so la ma chen re zig, Sol wa deb so yi dam chen re zig \u2026 Queens can use the prayers. The streets are deserted. Signs on the closed Himalayan Yak restaurant and the Popular Driving School, the Afghan Kebab and Grill and the S.M. Digital Sign & Printing store, will all give the same reason: Due to the Covid-19 crisis \u2026 Mr. Trump today only intensifies the apocalyptic mood. He has continued to downplay the crisis, but news reports from his home borough \u2014 he was raised in upscale Jamaica Estates, less than six miles from Elmhurst Hospital \u2014 seem to give him momentary pause. \u201cWhen I see the trucks pull up, to take out bodies \u2014 and these are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden, and they\u2019re pulling up to take out bodies \u2014 and you look inside and you see the black body bags.\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you say, \u2018What\u2019s in there? It\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital. Must be supplies.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not supplies. It\u2019s people.\u201d Some local officials and neighborhood advocates are too furious to engage in macabre musings. They have been decrying what they see as the government\u2019s failure to respond adequately to a pandemic in an immigrant community notorious for overcrowded conditions. But everyone is forced to adapt, including Captain Cermeli of the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, where more than a third of the officers are out sick. With his short-cropped hair and crisp white uniform shirt, Captain Cermeli, 39, exudes an embrace of order. In his precinct office, the arrangement of family photographs, the crayon drawings, the awards and honors, are all just so. But how do you apply order to an invisible threat? To a Queens you grew up in, but now barely recognize: No streams of commuters pouring down the stairs from the elevated 7 train. No crowds making the pilgrimage to cheer the Mets at Citi Field. No shoppers at the Queens Center mall. These days, his officers guard against burglaries in closed, untended storefronts. They cruise Flushing Meadows Corona Park, delivering reminders by loudspeaker to maintain social distancing. They stand sentry over those who have died at home until the bodies can be collected. When he returns to his Long Island home at night, Captain Cermeli enters through the garage, showers and takes pains not to embrace his two children, 12 and 9. Years ago, during an earlier tour, the captain found a glass-encased crucifix behind one of the 110th Precinct\u2019s file cabinets. When he returned as commanding officer in February, he hung it on a wall in his office. Now he takes time to stand before the crucifix and, like Dawa Sherpa, pray for better days. Keep my family safe. Keep my men and women safe. Keep me safe. Dawa sits upright in a corner of the emergency room. He sits as Sunday night blurs into Monday, and Monday into Tuesday. Now and then he stretches his legs, draping his black jacket over his padded chair to claim it. He asks the nurses who monitor his vitals if there is a bed, only to be told not yet. He feels hungry and is given a sandwich, but he is unable to eat. He gets by on juice and water and oxygen and prayer. Sol wa deb so la ma chen re zig, Sol wa deb so yi dam chen re zig \u2026 Tuesday becomes Wednesday. Finally, Dawa is led to a room on the third floor. He sheds his stale clothes for a gray hospital gown and eases into the comfort of a bed for the first time in four days. His roommate, a man with the same virus, speaks only Spanish. Still, they exchange encouragement with simple gestures. A nod. A thumbs-up. A peace sign. \u2014 Mayor de Blasio A gray Chrysler minivan makes its daily rounds. Its driver listens to anything that distracts, from sports to hip-hop to Johnny Cash. He drinks Gatorade now instead of coffee; he has enough trouble sleeping. This is Tom Habermann, 34, manager and resident mortician of the Guida Funeral Home. Thin and exhausted, he wears jeans and a sweater instead of his normal work attire of somber black. Death is too common for any formality. He spends these days driving from hospital to hospital, collecting bodies. There is no time for embalming, or choosing floral arrangements, or assembling pallbearers. There is only the sliding of body bags into the minivan\u2019s hold, again and again. The Guida Funeral Home, a family-owned anchor of Corona for more than a century, usually handles 100 or so deaths a year; it will nearly match that number in just eight weeks this spring. An answering service has been retained to handle the many calls from people begging for help, now that some parlors are refusing to accept virus victims or are too busy to even answer the phone. Mr. Habermann and Eddie Guida Jr., the funeral home\u2019s owner and his best friend from high school, do what they can. They see themselves as performing a grim but necessary duty at a time when the rituals of mourning have been upended. The last responders. But the volume is too great. Hospitals and funeral homes do not have enough room for all the bodies; crematories and cemeteries do not have enough time. A local crematory recently offered: You can come next Friday \u2014 but bring only two. Mr. Guida, 34, stocky and tattooed, has relied on his many connections. An uncle has a friend on Long Island who has provided a 54-by-8-foot refrigerated truck, and one of his cousins owns an empty lot nearby. That is where the parked truck now hums, the temperature set at 32 degrees. Soon it will hold nearly 50 bodies. Mr. Guida feels the pressure of stewardship for his family\u2019s funeral home, which is old enough to have handled deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic. He worries that the parlor will not be able to keep up with demand. But Mr. Habermann is the one who has to collect the bodies. He then has to set the facial features of the dead for simple headshots that allow for both positive identification and some closure for families who have been denied wakes and viewings. He drives his minivan to Elmhurst Hospital. To Flushing Hospital. To Coney Island Hospital. To Mather Hospital out on Long Island. Back to the funeral home. Then to the truck. Sometimes Mr. Habermann listens to the radio as he drives. Sometimes he thinks about the apartment renovations that he and his wife never seem able to finish. Sometimes he wonders when death will become normal again. Sometimes, at the end of the day, the professional facade cracks, and the mortician cries. The news on this overcast day is not merely bad, announces the governor, Mr. Cuomo. It is terrible. New York State has just recorded its highest single-day death toll as a result of the coronavirus: 779. As more losses are counted in the coming months, the number will change slightly. But this span of days will remain a dark milestone: the virus\u2019s deadliest time in New York. The city has also released some new, disturbing statistics. The virus is killing Black and Latino people at twice the rate of white people. \u201cEvery number is a face,\u201d the governor says. Since the outbreak began a little more than a month ago, the state has counted 6,268 fatalities. Mr. Cuomo notes that this is more than twice the number of lives lost in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. But, he says, there is also \u201cgood news.\u201d The very concept seems so removed from life in Queens, where the only sounds during this somber Holy Week, when Christians commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus, seem to be ambulance sirens and the chirping birds of early spring. But city and state health officials have gleaned a pinhole of light in the enveloping gloom: Daily admissions to intensive care units are down. Daily intubations are down. Hospitalizations are beginning to flatten. The twinning of two simple words \u2014 good news \u2014 gives oxygen to hope. Tracking these same trends is Israel Rocha Jr., the chief executive at Elmhurst Hospital, whose life has been a round-the-clock churn of crisis management and personal prayer. He all but lives in a conference room where the latest statistics are shared, the latest plans proposed, the latest worries expressed. The hospital is testing well over 200 patients a day for the virus, with positive results climbing to an astounding 80 percent. At the same time, scores of its own workers are testing positive. But Mr. Rocha, 42, has seen statistics similar to the ones informing the governor\u2019s encouraging words. Sitting in his office, where an artwork on the wall declares that \u201cQueens is the Future,\u201d he has pored over reports showing that positivity rates at Elmhurst have plateaued. For the first time in more than a month, it becomes slightly easier for the head of Elmhurst Hospital to breathe. Evening approaches, the clouds part and a Covid patient at Elmhurst prepares to leave. Dawa, the Uber driver who was once a Buddhist monk, has spent the last nine nights in the hospital. As he recovered, his roommate, who always returned his thumbs-up encouragement, had declined. One morning Dawa awakened beside an empty bed. He sheds his hospital gown for his street clothes and signs the discharge papers. He considers walking, but realizes he hasn\u2019t the strength. He takes an Uber the half-mile home. \u2014 Governor Cuomo A small stage materializes in a parking lot beside El Trio restaurant in Corona. Its scarlet cloth backdrop shields an old Chevy van from view. Headless mannequins in gowns of black and fuchsia stand like bodyguards at an exclusive outdoor affair. A memorial celebration is being held for Yimel Alvarado, who created those gowns for her cabaret performances in the restaurant\u2019s upstairs lounge, where she would lip-sync songs of love. Close friends, the Familia Alvarado, have adorned the stage with vivid bouquets that offset the pavement\u2019s gray. They recite the rosary and raise drinks in toast. Many wear face masks to guard against what might linger in the hot evening air. While the coronavirus continues its indiscriminate spread across the country, here in New York it has taken an uneasy summertime pause, allowing for an approximation of normal life. Allowing Yimel\u2019s family and friends to gather in her honor, albeit outdoors. But the great metropolis remains shaken by the virus\u2019s lethal supremacy; by tonight, health officials will have counted 18,787 confirmed deaths. And no corner of New York has felt its wrath more than the interlocking Queens neighborhoods of Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside. Tens of thousands are out of work. People stand in long food pantry lines while trying to maintain a safe distance. Many who are undocumented, and therefore ineligible for benefits, have turned to hawking wares from the sidewalks: tacos, pork rinds, flavored ices, face masks. Most everyone knows someone who has died. In this eight-square-mile patch of Queens, about 1,400 people will have died from the coronavirus by the end of July. In just one elementary school in Elmhurst, nearly 90 students have already lost a parent or guardian. Absence is everywhere. In a crowded apartment in Corona, the Lema family mourns not one death, but two. Days after a funeral service on Staten Island for Vicenta, the family\u2019s matriarch, her husband, Jos\u00e9, died of the virus before being told of his wife\u2019s death. Two small urns containing their ashes sit on a chipped dresser in the bedroom they shared, with a statue of the Virgin Mary between them. Their pregnant daughter Rosa plans to take the urns back to Ecuador. She is waiting for the necessary paperwork \u2014 and the birth of her son. In Woodside, Joe Farris continues to adjust to life without his partner, Jack Wongserat. For a few weeks he slept on the living room couch, unable to enter their bedroom, much less remove the chair that medics had tossed on the bed while tending to Jack. Jack\u2019s many pairs of sneakers still fill the shoe rack near the front door, and the pieces of china for the restaurant he never opened sit in a glass case. The Buddha-figurine gold necklace that Jack wore the day he died rests in a place of honor. But Joe is making progress. He plays Buddhist meditation music, practices forms of stress reduction and sleeps in the bed he no longer shares. Many recovered. Some experienced minor symptoms. Some endured what seemed like an especially bad flu. Some came so close to dying that they will feel the breath knocked out of them for months. After being discharged from Elmhurst Hospital, Dawa Sherpa spent weeks recuperating. Now, while his wife works, he cares for their three sons \u2014 the youngest cartwheels through the apartment \u2014 and volunteers at the United Sherpa Association, preparing care packages for those still in need. He has not returned to driving for Uber. Shamsul Chowdhury, the bank officer from Bangladesh who became a taxi driver in Queens, has also recovered, but his family has not gone unscathed. Three relatives died, and every other member of his household fell ill: his wife; their daughter, Mahdia; and two sons. So many of his taxi-driving colleagues were lost to the virus that there is talk of a memorial. But Shamsul, too, has given up driving for hire; soon he will have a new job as a mail handler for the United States Postal Service. Mahdia is now working as an unpaid intern for a state senator\u2019s office \u2014 her tasks include helping constituents apply for unemployment insurance \u2014 and will return to Cornell in the fall. The virus has brought about other changes. Elmhurst Hospital has held virtual meetings to reassure residents and dispel misconceptions. It has improved ways of providing updates on patients\u2019 conditions, and helped to establish the clinical protocols for treating Covid, forged in the hellish days of March. Not that those days are forgotten. Here and there are modest tributes: a photo of a well-liked mechanic outside a bicycle-repair shop; a black ribbon in a bakery window; a votive candle\u2019s quivering flame. But as the city anticipates a resurgence of the virus, one that will approach frightening levels by late fall, the worry is whether the warnings have been heeded. Will the lesson \u2014 that overcrowding helped make Queens an epicenter of the worst pandemic in a century \u2014 have been learned? Up and down Roosevelt Avenue, fliers taped to the elevated subway columns advertise rooms newly available in basements, in subdivided apartments, in dwellings within dwellings. They flutter in the city breeze. Outside El Trio on this hot and humid July evening, the rosaries have been said, a mariachi band has performed, and a black box containing Yimel\u2019s ashes has been placed on the red-cloth stage. Her younger sister Olivia, the last family member to see her alive, wears a T-shirt depicting Yimel as an angel in a fabulous red gown. Olivia has lost her job at the dry cleaners; her arms are now tanned from selling bottled water in a park. She calls her mother, Concepci\u00f3n Alvarado, in Mexico. Soon the gray-haired woman appears on the cellphone screen, beside the altar she has set up in Yimel\u2019s honor outside a cinder-block house. There, on a plate, sits her daughter\u2019s favorite pastry. The mother cries, and wipes her tears with a rag. As the sky-blue evening gives in to the cerulean night, grief cedes ground. Members of the Familia Alvarado disappear, only to return in sequined gowns and caftans. Elevated by their platform shoes, they vamp and sing of love and defiance. Shots of tequila are raised up and knocked back, as people erupt in shouts of Que viva Yimel! The celebration of life in a drab parking lot in Queens continues well past midnight, into the hope and uncertainty of another day.

    "article_text": "Republicans Pushed to Restrict Voting. Millions of Americans Pushed Back.  Nearly 160 million Americans voted in the 2020 elections, by far the most in history and a level of turnout not seen in over a century, representing an extraordinary milestone of civic engagement in a year marked by a devastating pandemic, record unemployment and political unrest. With all but three states having completed their final count, and next week\u2019s deadline for final certification of the results approaching, the sheer volume of Americans who actually voted in November was eye-opening: 66.7 percent of the voting-eligible population, according to the U.S. Election Project, a nonpartisan website run by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks county-level data. It is the highest percentage since 1900, when the voting pool was much smaller, and easily surpasses two high-water marks of the modern era: the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy and the 2008 election of Barack Obama. Since the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote and roughly doubled the voting eligible population, turnout had never surpassed 64 percent. The shifts that led to this year\u2019s surge in voting, in particular the broad expansion of voting options and the prolonged period for casting ballots, could forever alter elections and political campaigns in America, providing a glimpse into the electoral future. A backlash from the right could prevent that, however. In many ways, the increase in voting is what Mr. Trump and the Republican Party are now openly campaigning against in their floundering bid to overturn his clear loss to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 whose popular vote lead grew to seven million on Friday. Republicans have portrayed the burgeoning voting ranks as nefarious and the expanded access to voting options as ripe for fraud \u2014 despite the fact that the record turnout provided them numerous victories down ballot. Though Mr. Trump and the party have not managed to prove a single claim of fraud in the courts \u2014 where they and their allies have lost or withdrawn dozens of cases \u2014 Republicans at the state level are vowing to enact a new round of voting restrictions to prevent what they claim \u2014 without evidence \u2014 is widespread fraud. Here\u2019s a look at how many electoral votes have been certified \u2014 or made official \u2014 so far. The swell in voting this year was powered by a polarizing presidential race and the many steps that election officials took to make voting safer \u2014 and therefore easier \u2014 during the coronavirus pandemic. Indeed, according to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, 94 percent of voters said that voting in the November election was \u201ceasy.\u201d That ease in voting could also be read as \u201caccess.\u201d The expansion of vote by mail, early voting, online registration and online ballot requests broke down many of the traditional barriers that sometimes kept people away from the ballot box. Others simply used long-existing laws as they sought to deliver a verdict on Mr. Trump\u2019s four tumultuous years in office.  The expansion of voting options also created a fall \u201celection season\u201d rather than a sole Election Day, a change that is likely to endure and force political campaigns to restructure fall operations with a greater emphasis on getting out the vote over a period of weeks. \u201cWe opened the doors to access,\u201d said Adrian Fontes, the top election official in Maricopa County, the largest county in Arizona, where, for the first time, more than 80 percent of the eligible population voted in the general election. It also flipped from Republican to Democratic for the first time in 72 years. \u201cI think the most telling number is the 165,000 in-person Election Day voters,\u201d Mr. Fontes said about voter turnout in Maricopa County. \u201cWhen you get over two million people casting a ballot and less than 200,000 of them are actually walking in on Election Day and casting a fresh ballot, that\u2019s important.\u201d In interviews, election officials tempered their enthusiasm over this year\u2019s turnout by acknowledging several only-in-2020 factors. Mr. Trump is a unique public figure who drew considerable personal enmity from voters opposed to him. He ran at a time of extreme economic and social upheaval because of the pandemic. And lockdown orders and mass furloughs and layoffs gave Americans more time to consume news \u2014 both on the internet and through the old-fashioned network newscasts, which had their highest viewership in more than a decade \u2014 increasing their engagement with the election. \u201cVoters really thought about how they were going to vote, and many had a plan and executed on that plan,\u201d said Kim Wyman, the secretary of state in Washington. Although election experts caution against viewing the expansion of mail voting as the sole driver of turnout, it is clear that states that increased mail balloting or went to a complete vote-by-mail system had the highest participation. States that did not offer expansive vote-by-mail options were on the lower end of the scale. Hawaii, for instance, had the lowest voter participation in 2012 and 2016. But last year, it passed a universal vote-by-mail system, and last month, it experienced the highest voting increase in the country. Early voting increased there by nearly 111 percent compared with 2016, and the state\u2019s turnout of 57.5 percent was up by more than a third over all. Other states that encouraged voters to use existing mail options also saw their records increase. In Minnesota, which had the highest percentage turnout in the country at 79.96 percent, election officials mailed out ballot applications to every registered voter and ran an $830,000 voter education advertising program to explain options already on the books. \u201cThere was no huge legal shift in the legal terrain, or some new method of voting that was not on the books before,\u201d said Steve Simon, the secretary of state in Minnesota. \u201cThis was emphasizing and showcasing an option that had been there for a long time.\u201d In a sense, the pandemic brought with it the realization of a long-held dream of voting rights advocates. For decades, they have sought to increase turnout by making voting easier through provisions such as day-of-vote registration, early voting and voting by mail. Their goal was to help the country overcome a stubborn, national problem: For the better part of the past century, fewer than 60 percent of eligible voters have participated in national elections, and in some years, turnout has been far lower \u2014 ranking the United States\u2019 voter participation rate well below that of most of the developed world. Democrats have been generally supportive of efforts to increase turnout. Polls and population data have repeatedly shown that the voters most affected by the difficulties of in-person, Election Day voting \u2014 transient workers, people who move often or low-wage single parents who can\u2019t easily wait in long lines at polls on a Tuesday \u2014 traditionally vote more for Democrats than for Republicans. Similarly, polling and census data show that Black Americans, Hispanics and young people \u2014 important elements of the Democratic coalition \u2014 are more likely to be nonvoters than are older white people, a majority of whom regularly vote for Republican presidential candidates. The introduction of same-day registration and early voting, for instance, contributed to a surge in participation by Black voters in North Carolina in 2008, helping make Mr. Obama the first Democrat to win there since 1976. Republicans in statehouses there and elsewhere have spent the years since trying to place new restrictions on voting, at times running afoul of the courts. In Harris County, home to Houston and 4.7 million residents, election officials opened up drive-through voting sites across the county as a safe way to vote during a pandemic. More than 130,000 voters used the option. County officials also created multiple 24-hour voting sites for shift workers, and roughly 10,000 voters used them to cast their ballots. \u201cA good chunk of them told us that they would not have voted any other way, that this made voting possible for them,\u201d said Chris Hollins, the clerk for Harris County. Voting rights advocates have long viewed vote by mail as an important remedy for low turnout, but only with changes that would make it easier without compromising security. In many states, absentee voting has come with certain strings such as requirements for excuses, witness signatures or even notarization. Colorado, Utah, Washington State, Oregon and Hawaii have moved to nearly universal, mail-in voting systems and have had their turnout rates rise without any significant instances of fraud or irregularities. \u201cWhen we see vote by mail increase in any state, we simultaneously see a turnout increase,\u2019\u2019 said Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and an architect of the vote-by-mail system in Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s about making the process more accessible.\u201d Mr. McDonald, the professor, said that the wider embrace of voting by mail could have a significant effect on down-ballot elections, which traditionally have lower turnout; high propensity voters, he said, would be more likely to vote in local, municipal or off-year elections if a ballot arrived at their homes. Almost as soon as the coronavirus spread throughout the United States, Democrats pushed for the easier vote-by-mail provisions, arguing, for instance, that the acquisition of the witness signatures could be difficult during a pandemic, particularly for at-risk older voters who live alone. Democrats in Congress sought to make a similar push nationally, but they ran into stiff opposition from Mr. Trump, who gave rare public voice to the idea that Republicans don\u2019t want to make voting easier because that would make it harder for them to win. \u201cThey had things \u2014 levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d he said in March. In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s logic \u2014 that increased mail-in voting would automatically help Democrats \u2014 proved flawed. Several academic studies have found that mail voting does not necessarily give one party an advantage over another. In Georgia, for instance, the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said that Mr. Trump would have won his state had he not dissuaded his own voters from using mail ballots. Georgia, which voted for a Democrat for president for the first time in nearly 30 years, had 67 percent turnout. Of course, even as barriers to voting were toppled and a broad voter education effort spilled across newspapers, cable news and social media, some political operatives saw the expansion of voting as rooted in the singular force that dominated American politics for the past four years. \u201cTwo words,\u201d said Robby Mook, the former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in 2016, in an email. \u201cDONALD TRUMP.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Swiss Cheese Model of Pandemic Defense Lately, in the ongoing conversation about how to defeat the coronavirus, experts have made reference to the \u201cSwiss cheese model\u201d of pandemic defense. The metaphor is easy enough to grasp: Multiple layers of protection, imagined as cheese slices, block the spread of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. No one layer is perfect; each has holes, and when the holes align, the risk of infection increases. But several layers combined \u2014 social distancing, plus masks, plus hand-washing, plus testing and tracing, plus ventilation, plus government messaging \u2014 significantly reduce the overall risk. Vaccination will add one more protective layer. \u201cPretty soon you\u2019ve created an impenetrable barrier, and you really can quench the transmission of the virus,\u201d said Dr. Julie Gerberding, executive vice president and chief patient officer at Merck, who recently referenced the Swiss cheese model when speaking at a virtual gala fund-raiser for MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics in Manhattan. \u201cBut it requires all of those things, not just one of those things,\u201d she added. \u201cI think that\u2019s what our population is having trouble getting their head around. We want to believe that there is going to come this magic day when suddenly 300 million doses of vaccine will be available and we can go back to work and things will return to normal. That is absolutely not going to happen fast.\u201d Rather, Dr. Gerberding said in a follow-up email, expect to see \u201ca gradual improvement in protection, first among the highest need groups, and then more gradually among the rest of us.\u201d Until vaccines are widely available and taken, she said, \u201cwe will need to continue masks and other common-sense measures to protect ourselves and others.\u201d In October, Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, retweeted an infographic rendering of the Swiss cheese model, noting that it included \u201cthings that are personal *and* collective responsibility \u2014 note the \u2018misinformation mouse\u2019 busy eating new holes for the virus to pass through.\u201d \u201cOne of the first principles of pandemic response is, or ought to be, clear and consistent messaging from trusted sources,\u201d Dr. Hanage said in an email. \u201cUnfortunately the independence of established authorities like the C.D.C. has been called into question, and trust needs to be rebuilt as a matter of urgency.\u201d A catchy infographic is a powerful message, he said, but ultimately requires higher-level support. The Swiss cheese concept originated with James T. Reason, a cognitive psychologist, now a professor emeritus at the University of Manchester, England, in his 1990 book, \u201cHuman Error.\u201d A succession of disasters \u2014 including the Challenger shuttle explosion, Bhopal and Chernobyl \u2014 motivated the concept, and it became known as the \u201cSwiss cheese model of accidents,\u201d with the holes in the cheese slices representing errors that accumulate and lead to adverse events. The model has been widely used by safety analysts in various industries, including medicine and aviation, for many years. (Dr. Reason did not devise the \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d label; that is attributed to Rob Lee, an Australian air-safety expert, in the 1990s.) The model became famous, but it was not accepted uncritically; Dr. Reason himself noted that it had limitations and was intended as a generic tool or guide. In 2004, at a workshop addressing an aviation accident two years earlier near U\u0308berlingen, Germany, he delivered a talk with the title, \u201cU\u0308berlingen: Is Swiss cheese past its sell-by date?\u201d In 2006, a review of the model, published by the Eurocontrol Experimental Center, recounted that Dr. Reason, while writing the book chapter \u201cLatent errors and system disasters,\u201d in which an early version of the model appears, was guided by two notions: \u201cthe biological or medical metaphor of pathogens, and the central role played by defenses, barriers, controls and safeguards (analogous to the body\u2019s autoimmune system).\u201d The cheese metaphor now pairs fairly well with the coronavirus pandemic. Ian M. Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, in Brisbane, Australia, saw a smaller version on Twitter, but thought that it could do with more slices, more information. He created, with collaborators, the \u201cSwiss Cheese Respiratory Pandemic Defense\u201d and engaged his Twitter community, asking for feedback and putting the visualization through many iterations. \u201cCommunity engagement is very high!\u201d he said. Now circulating widely, the infographic has been translated into more than two dozen languages. \u201cThis multilayered approach to reducing risk is used in many industries, especially those where failure could be catastrophic,\u201d Dr. Mackay said, via email. \u201cDeath is catastrophic to families, and for loved ones, so I thought Professor Reason\u2019s approach fit in very well during the circulation of a brand-new, occasionally hidden, sometimes severe and occasionally deadly respiratory virus.\u201d The following is an edited version of a recent email conversation with Dr. Mackay. A. The real power of this infographic \u2014 and James Reason\u2019s approach to account for human fallibility \u2014 is that it\u2019s not really about any single layer of protection or the order of them, but about the additive success of using multiple layers, or cheese slices. Each slice has holes or failings, and those holes can change in number and size and location, depending on how we behave in response to each intervention. Take masks as one example of a layer. Any mask will reduce the risk that you will unknowingly infect those around you, or that you will inhale enough virus to become infected. But it will be less effective at protecting you and others if it doesn\u2019t fit well, if you wear it below your nose, if it\u2019s only a single piece of cloth, if the cloth is a loose weave, if it has an unfiltered valve, if you don\u2019t dispose of it properly, if you don\u2019t wash it, or if you don\u2019t sanitize your hands after you touch it. Each of these are examples of a hole. And that\u2019s in just one layer. To be as safe as possible, and to keep those around you safe, it\u2019s important to use more slices to prevent those volatile holes from aligning and letting virus through. A. Distance is the most effective intervention; the virus doesn\u2019t have legs, so if you are physically distant from people, you avoid direct contact and droplets. Then you have to consider inside spaces, which are especially in play during winter or in hotter countries during summer: the bus, the gym, the office, the bar or the restaurant. That\u2019s because we know SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious in aerosols (small floaty droplets) and we know that aerosol spread explains Covid-19 superspreading events. Try not to be in those spaces with others, but if you have to be, minimize your time there (work from home if you can) and wear a mask. Don\u2019t go grocery shopping as often. Hold off on going out, parties, gatherings. You can do these things later. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: We don\u2019t talk about eye coverings much, but we should, because we don\u2019t know enough about the role of eyes in transmission. We do know that eyes are a window to the upper respiratory tract. A. The misinformation mouse can erode any of those layers. People who are uncertain about an intervention may be swayed by a loud and confident-sounding voice proclaiming that a particular layer is ineffective. Usually, that voice is not an expert on the subject at all. When you look to the experts \u2014 usually to your local public health authorities or the World Health Organization \u2014 you\u2019ll find reliable information. An effect doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to reduce your risk and the risk to those around you. We need to remember that we\u2019re all part of a society, and if we each do our part, we can keep each other safer, which pays off for us as well. Another example: We look both ways for oncoming traffic before crossing a road. This reduces our risk of being hit by a car but doesn\u2019t reduce it to zero. A speeding car could still come out of nowhere. But if we also cross with the lights, and keep looking as we walk, and don\u2019t stare at our phone, we drastically reduce our risk of being hit. We\u2019re already used to doing that. When we listen to the loud nonexperts who have no experience in protecting our health and safety, we are inviting them to have an impact in our lives. That\u2019s not a risk we should take. We just need to get used to these new risk-reduction steps for today\u2019s new risk \u2014 a respiratory virus pandemic, instead of a car. A. We each need to do our part: stay apart from others, wear a mask when we can\u2019t, think about our surroundings, for example. But we can also expect our leadership to be working to create the circumstances for us to be safe \u2014 like regulations about the air exchange inside public spaces, creating quarantine and isolation premises, communicating specifically with us (not just at us), limiting border travel, pushing us to keep getting our health checks, and providing mental health or financial support for those who suffer or can\u2019t get paid while in a lockdown. A. We each use these approaches in everyday life. But for the pandemic, this all feels new and like a lot of extra work. Because everything is new. In the end, though, we\u2019re just forming new habits. Like navigating our latest phone\u2019s operating system or learning how to play that new console game I got for my birthday. It might take some time to get across it all, but it\u2019s worthwhile. In working together to reduce the risk of infection, we can save lives and improve health. And as a bonus, the multilayered risk reduction approach can even decrease the number of times we get the flu or a bad chest cold. Also, sometimes slices sit under a mandate \u2014 it\u2019s important we also abide by those rules and do what the experts think we should. They\u2019re looking out for our health.

    "article_text": "One of the First Virus Hot Spots in the U.S. Is Under Siege Again NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. \u2014 There are lines again at Glen Island Park, the drive-through coronavirus testing center that state officials set up when the coronavirus was discovered in this city in March. Nurses at the local hospital went on a two-day strike this week over fears that their working conditions made them vulnerable to infection as hospitalization rates climb. And at the synagogue where the first case here was detected around nine months ago, a sign on the door now turns people who live in coronavirus hot zones away. Prayers for them are virtual. As the virus rages across Westchester County, it has returned to New Rochelle, a city hit so hard during the outbreak\u2019s earliest days that it was for a time the epicenter of the pandemic in the region. In early March, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the state\u2019s first so-called containment zone in this New York City suburb, New Rochelle\u2019s fate proclaimed an unnerving message: The virus is here. Now it is back. On Friday, officials added 11,271 new cases statewide as the daily positive test rate climbed above 5 percent. In New Rochelle, which added 73 new cases on Friday, the surge comes with a profound sense of defeat. This city of 80,000 about 20 miles north of Manhattan on Interstate 95 had at one point emerged as a model of how to beat the disease. That the coronavirus could re-emerge here, in a city and county scarred by loss and intimately familiar with the disease, is not only a testament to the virus\u2019s intractability. Local leaders and health experts fear it is also a bellwether for the rest of the country: If the disease can roar back into Westchester, the home of New Rochelle, a city that met the virus first and knows it with cruel intimacy, it can happen anywhere. Some residents have returned to the extreme measures that helped them survive the first wave, cloistering themselves in their homes. Others said they had watched with dismay as their neighbors let down their guard. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s back at the scene of the crime,\u201d said Josh Berkowitz, the owner of Eden Wok, a kosher Chinese restaurant on North Avenue, just down the road from the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue. A congregant there had the city\u2019s first detected case of the virus. \u201cIt just shows we are so powerless,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said. The seven-day average test positivity rate in Westchester has climbed to about 5 percent, far higher in some areas: In Peekskill and Ossining, the rate among those who have been tested is about 10 percent. In November, the state designated Port Chester, on the Connecticut border, as an \u201corange zone,\u201d shutting down in-person schooling and closing certain businesses. \u201cThe first time through we didn\u2019t really realize how severe it would get, so we were learning as we went along,\u201d George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, said. \u201cThere was a sense that we took the best shot that Covid could give us, but we survived it, and things got better \u2014 but the virus isn\u2019t done with us.\u201d Parts of New Rochelle, as well as parts of Yonkers, Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown, have been labeled yellow zones, requiring measures like weekly coronavirus testing for 20 percent of the student population, among other steps. As of Friday, there were 5,968 active cases countywide \u2014 more than double the number two weeks ago \u2014 and over 290 people were hospitalized; numbers on par with what they were in May. Controlling the spread, which is dispersed across the region, is particularly problematic in Westchester. During the virus\u2019s recent resurgence, about 70 percent of infections have been tied to private gatherings, according to the state\u2019s contact-tracing efforts.  \u201cWhen the virus is contained to one geographic area, or one source of spread that is easily controllable, it is easier to \u2018close the valve,\u2019 either geographically or by industry,\u201d said Gareth Rhodes, the state\u2019s deputy superintendent of financial services and a member of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s coronavirus task force.  Now, with six cluster zones scattered across the county, he said, the virus \u201cis geographically more dispersed than just one area, and the ability to conduct enforcement of gatherings in private homes is much more limited.\u201d There are other striking differences from the pandemic\u2019s earliest days here: Where the initial outbreak was first detected among a middle-class community connected to a local synagogue, the disease is now afflicting the predominantly blue-collar workers in the denser pockets of Westchester\u2019s towns. And as hospitals fill up again, doctors in the area have learned new treatment strategies, like delaying the use of ventilators. \u201cThe situation we are facing right now is undoubtedly grave and challenging, but it doesn\u2019t have the same intense anxiety that I think we felt in the spring when all of this was painfully unfamiliar,\u201d said Noam Bramson, New Rochelle\u2019s mayor. \u201cThis is now a more familiar enemy.\u201d On Tuesday, nurses at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital staged a walkout over contract negotiations that began before the pandemic hit, but they also cited risks they had been subjected to by the outbreak. \u201cThis place was the epicenter, the beginning of Covid,\u201d Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, the president of the union representing the nurses, the New York State Nurses Association told ABC News. \u201cWe have nurses who\u2019ve died. We have people who\u2019ve died, who\u2019ve worked here for lack of PPE, for improper care, improper staffing and training. That\u2019s what this strike is about.\u201d On Thursday, officials in Port Chester held an emergency meeting on how to fight the virus. Spanish and English language ads with clergy members and other local leaders highlighting the severity of the rise will be broadcast on local stations. Mobile testing units are being deployed. Giant electronic billboards flashing reminders to wear masks and social distance will be set up. On Friday in Tar\u00adry\u00adtown, the annual party for the lighting of the village\u2019s Christmas trees was moved online in an effort to comply with the yellow-zone restriction limiting outdoor gatherings to no more than 25 people. Similar holiday plans are in place in Sleepy Hollow, but also in areas that have not achieved that status but where numbers are creeping up, like Dobbs Ferry and Irvington. Some county residents are taking matters into their own hands \u2014 as best as they can. In New Rochelle, Dr. Michael Wechsler, 80, said that in recent weeks he had returned to the hermetic way he was forced to live at the height of the outbreak, and had once again stopped going to the grocery store. Dr. Wechsler, a urologist, blamed the rise in cases on a relaxed attitude toward the virus, even here, where National Guard troops rolled in to scrub public buildings in March, and fleets of health workers in head-to-toe protective equipment fanned out across neighborhoods. \u201cPeople tend to repress something bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a coping mechanism.\u201d In Port Chester, Ana Ponce, 79, put a surgical mask under the carrot nose of the inflatable snowman in her front yard as a message to her neighborhood: Mask up. \u201cIt makes me sad and it makes me worry,\u201d Ms. Ponce said on Thursday, referring to Port Chester\u2019s 241 active cases. By Friday, the total number of active cases in the village rose to 270. Ms. Ponce said she was also frustrated by what she considered the lax approach many local residents were taking to wearing masks and following social-distancing guidelines. \u201cA lot of people,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t have the sensibility to understand that they are hurting themselves and are hurting other people.\u201d Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "For Boris Johnson, a Week to Exorcise the Demons of 2020 LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s approval of a coronavirus vaccine this week, beating every other Western country, would be a political gift for any leader. But perhaps none needs it as much as Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A successful vaccine rollout could be the last chance for Mr. Johnson\u2019s government to show competence, after botching virtually every other step of its response to the pandemic, from tardy lockdowns to a costly, ineffective test-and-trace program \u2014 all of which contributed to the country having the highest death toll in Europe. It also comes just as Britain has reached a climactic stage in its long negotiations with the European Union for a trade relationship after having left the bloc this year. Allies of Mr. Johnson were quick to claim that the swift approval of the vaccine vindicated the Brexit project. That claim was quickly debunked. Nevertheless, the mass vaccination program will be an early test of how well Britain works once it is fully untethered from Europe. \u201cThe British government is looking for ways to claim a victory because they\u2019ve made such a bloody mess of the epidemic,\u201d said David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government who has become a vocal critic of its performance. \u201cThe nationalistic response is brutish and rather distasteful.\u201d Still, it is difficult to separate politics from public health. As the first vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine rolled into Britain in refrigerated trucks from Belgium this week, negotiators in London were in the last stages of trying to stitch together a long-term, E.U.-British trade agreement. The talks were paused on Friday evening, amid signs that a breakthrough would require personal intervention by Mr. Johnson. The pandemic has raised the pressure on him to strike a deal, since a failure could deepen the economic damage caused by multiple lockdowns. Yet the convergence of events could also be fortuitous, allowing the beleaguered prime minister to resolve an issue that has divided Britain for more than four years at the very moment that relief finally begins to arrive for a country ravaged by the virus. Pro-Brexit politicians struck a bluntly nationalistic chord, saying Britain\u2019s early approval of the vaccine was the first of many triumphs \u2014 though for all the fanfare, it may be only days ahead of U.S. authorization and a few weeks ahead of the European Union. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said Britain moved faster than its neighbors because \u201cwe\u2019re a much better country than every single one of them.\u201d The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said European regulators were \u201ca bit sniffy\u201d that they had not yet managed to approve it. \u201cWe have, we\u2019re leaving, draw your own conclusions,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe are now free of the dead hand of the European Union.\u201d In fact, the swift approval of the Pfizer vaccine was not enabled by Brexit. Although Britain formally left the European Union last January, it continues to adhere to the bloc\u2019s regulations until a transition period expires on Dec. 31. The British health regulator invoked an emergency power, available to all European Union members, to move faster in the case of a pandemic. Still, the optics of Britain striking out on its own, ahead of France and Germany, are appealing because they play into the pro-Brexit argument that a Britain unshackled from Brussels will be more agile and flexible, able to act as a free agent in the global market for everything from vaccines to ventilators. \u201cNo one is very proud of our record on the pandemic,\u201d said Jonathan Powell, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. \u201cBut they believe we\u2019re magically going to become a better country by being outside of Europe.\u201d If anything, Mr. Powell said, the Pfizer vaccine was a testament to the value of pre-Brexit, cross-border collaboration: It was developed by Turkish-born scientists at a German biotechnology firm, produced by an American pharmaceutical company and manufactured in a plant in Belgium. Brexit has colored Mr. Johnson\u2019s handling of the pandemic in ways obvious and subtle. Britain declined to join a multi-billion-dollar European Union vaccine purchasing fund and shunned a European consortium to buy ventilators. The latter decision provoked anxiety in the early days of the pandemic, when it looked as if hospitals might not have enough machines for their patients. In the end, the hospitals were able to cope with the demand. On Monday, Mr. Johnson boasted that Britain, acting on its own, was the first country to pre-order supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, securing 40 million doses. All told, it has ordered more than 350 million doses of seven vaccine candidates, hedging its bets in case some do not pan out. But Mr. Johnson diverged from other European leaders in waiting until late March to impose a lockdown. This fall, amid a second wave of the virus, he again moved more tentatively than leaders on the Continent, imposing a nationwide lockdown only in November. Critics say those delays cost lives; Britain\u2019s death toll just surpassed 60,000. \u201cWhile we were in lockdown, we appeared to do nothing about a test-trace-and-isolate system,\u201d Professor King said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a system that has anywhere near the capacity we need.\u201d He and other experts expressed less concern about the British regulator\u2019s rapid approval of the Pfizer vaccine. Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, they said, had a history of independence and a reputation across Europe for thoroughly vetting new drugs. They also expressed confidence that the vaccine will be distributed through Britain\u2019s National Health Service, not by private contractors, like the companies involved in the trouble-prone test-and-trace system. Even so, there are worries about how to distribute the vaccine, which needs to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Before the first injections, the government abruptly changed the priority for who would get the shot first, ruling out those in nursing homes in favor of nursing home staff and people 80 and over in hospitals or with appointments there. The government\u2019s muddled messaging has damaged Mr. Johnson, not just with the public but also with members of his own Conservative Party. He had to fend off a rebellion among Conservatives in Parliament this week over tiered restrictions that replaced the nationwide lockdown lifted on Tuesday. Experts said they were hopeful that the arrival of a vaccine would leach some of the vitriol out of the debate over lockdowns. But the government\u2019s messaging could be a weakness in winning broad public acceptance of the vaccine. In addition to anti-vaccination activists, experts said it would confront wariness from people who will question whether Britain rushed its approval. \u201cThey need to think about people who are saying, \u2018Why is this being pushed so quickly?\u2019\u201d said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health program at the University of Edinburgh, who added she would take it \u201ctomorrow, if I could.\u201d Mr. Johnson named Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of Parliament with a background in public-opinion research, to coordinate the deployment of the vaccine. Mr. Zahawi, who has a degree in chemical engineering, co-founded YouGov, an internet polling company, which he later sold. In YouGov\u2019s polling on the vaccine \u2014 conducted last month after Pfizer reported positive results in clinical trials \u2014 two-thirds of those surveyed said they were \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201cfairly likely\u201d to take the vaccine when it becomes available. A fifth said they were unlikely to take it, while 12 percent said they were not sure. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to see social influencers or health care workers lining up to take it,\u201d Professor Sridhar said.",

    "article_text": "The Elderly vs. Essential Workers: Who Should Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First? With the coronavirus pandemic surging and initial vaccine supplies limited, the United States faces a hard choice: Should the country\u2019s immunization program focus in the early months on the elderly and people with serious medical conditions, who are dying of the virus at the highest rates, or on essential workers, an expansive category encompassing Americans who have borne the greatest risk of infection? Health care workers and the frailest of the elderly \u2014 residents of long-term-care facilities \u2014 will almost certainly get the first shots, under guidelines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued on Thursday. But with vaccination expected to start this month, the debate among federal and state health officials about who goes next, and lobbying from outside groups to be included, is growing more urgent. It\u2019s a question increasingly guided by concerns over the inequities laid bare by the pandemic, from disproportionately high rates of infection and death among poor people and people of color to disparate access to testing, child care and technology for online schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s damnable that we are even being placed in this position that we have to make these choices,\u201d said the Rev. William J. Barber II, a co-chairman of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, a national coalition that calls attention to the challenges of the working poor. \u201cBut if we have to make the choice, we cannot once again leave poor and low-wealth essential workers to be last.\u201d Ultimately, the choice comes down to whether preventing death or curbing the spread of the virus and returning to some semblance of normalcy is the highest priority. \u201cIf your goal is to maximize the preservation of human life, then you would bias the vaccine toward older Americans,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said recently. \u201cIf your goal is to reduce the rate of infection, then you would prioritize essential workers. So it depends what impact you\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d The trade-off between the two is muddied by the fact that the definition of \u201cessential workers\u201d used by the C.D.C. comprises nearly 70 percent of the American work force, sweeping in not just grocery store clerks and emergency responders, but tugboat operators, exterminators and nuclear energy workers. Some labor economists and public health officials consider the category overbroad and say it should be narrowed to only those who interact in person with the public. Essential Frontline An independent committee of medical experts that advises the C.D.C. on immunization practices will soon vote on whom to recommend for the second phase of vaccination \u2014 \u201cPhase 1b.\u201d In a meeting last month, all voting members of the committee indicated support for putting essential workers ahead of people 65 and older and those with high-risk health conditions. Historically, the committee relied on scientific evidence to inform its decisions. But now the members are weighing social justice concerns as well, noted Lisa A. Prosser, a professor of health policy and decision sciences at the University of Michigan. \u201cTo me the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country,\u201d Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a committee member and a pediatrics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said at the time, \u201cand clearly favors the essential worker group because of the high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers among essential workers.\u201d That position runs counter to frameworks proposed by the World Health Organization, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and many countries, which say that reducing deaths should be the unequivocal priority and that older and sicker people should thus go before the workers, a view shared by many in public health and medicine. Dr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director and the nation\u2019s top public health official, reminded the advisory committee of the importance of older people, saying in a statement on Thursday that he looked forward to \u201cfuture recommendations that, based on vaccine availability, demonstrate that we as a nation also prioritize the elderly.\u201d Once the committee votes, Dr. Redfield will decide whether to accept its recommendations as the official guidance of the agency. Only rarely does a C.D.C. director reject a recommendation from the committee, whose 14 members are selected by the Health and Human Services secretary, serve four-and-a-half-year terms and have never confronted a task as high in profile as this one. But ultimately, the decision will be up to governors and state and local health officials. They are not required to follow C.D.C. guidelines, though historically they have done so. There are about 90 million essential workers nationwide, as defined by a division of the Department of Homeland Security that compiled a roster of jobs that help maintain critical infrastructure during a pandemic. That list is long, and because there won\u2019t be enough doses to reach everyone at first, states are preparing to make tough decisions: Louisiana\u2019s preliminary plan, for example, puts prison guards and food processing workers ahead of teachers and grocery employees. Nevada\u2019s prioritizes education and public transit workers over those in retail and food processing. At this early point, many state plans put at least some people who are older and live independently, or people who have medical conditions, ahead of most essential workers, though that could change after the C.D.C. committee makes a formal recommendation on the next phase. One occupation whose priority is being hotly debated is teaching. The C.D.C. includes educators as essential workers. But not everyone agrees with that designation. Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, argued that teachers should not be included as essential workers, if a central goal of the committee is to reduce health inequities. \u201cTeachers have middle-class salaries, are very often white, and they have college degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they should be treated better, but they are not among the most mistreated of workers.\u201d Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, disagreed. Teachers not only ensure that children don\u2019t fall further behind in their education, she said, but are also critical to the work force at large. \u201cWhen you talk about disproportionate impact and you\u2019re concerned about people getting back into the labor force, many are mothers, and they will have a harder time if their children don\u2019t have a reliable place to go,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you think generally about people who have jobs where they can\u2019t telework, they are disproportionately Black and brown. They\u2019ll have more of a challenge when child care is an issue.\u201d In September, academic researchers analyzed the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s list of essential workers and found that it broadly mirrored the demographics of the American labor force. The researchers proposed a narrower, more vulnerable category \u2014 \u201cfrontline workers,\u201d such as food deliverers, cashiers and emergency medical technicians, who must work face to face with others and are thus at greater risk of contracting the virus. By this definition, said Francine D. Blau, a labor economist at Cornell University and an author of the study, teachers belong in the larger category of essential workers. However, when they work in classrooms rather than remotely, she said, they would fit into the \u201cfrontline\u201d group. Individual states categorize teachers differently. Dr. Blau said that if supplies are short, frontline workers should be emphasized. \u201cThese are a subset of essential workers who, given the nature of their jobs, must provide their labor in person. Prioritizing them makes sense given the heightened risk that they face.\u201d The analysis, a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, is in line with other critics, who say that the list of essential workers is too wide-ranging. \u201cIf groups are too large, then you\u2019re not really focusing on priorities,\u201d said Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who worked on the vaccination frameworks for the W.H.O. and the National Academies. The essential workers on the federal list make up nearly 70 percent of the American labor force, the researchers said, compared with 42 percent for the frontline workers. Women made up 39 percent of frontline workers and, in certain occupations, far more. Frontline workers\u2019 education levels are lower, as are their wages \u2014 on average, just under $22 an hour. The proportion of Black and Hispanic workers is higher than in the broader category of essential workers. Some health policy experts said that to prioritize preventing deaths rather than reducing virus transmission was simply a pragmatic choice, because there won\u2019t be enough vaccine initially available to make a meaningful dent in contagion. A more effective use of limited quantities, they say, is to save the lives of the most frail. Moreover, vaccine trial results so far show only that the shots can protect the individuals who receive them. The trials have not yet demonstrated that a vaccinated person would not infect others. Though scientists believe that is likely to be the case, it has yet to be proved. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Harald Schmidt, an expert in ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said that it is reasonable to put essential workers ahead of older adults, given their risks, and that they are disproportionately minorities. \u201cOlder populations are whiter, \u201d Dr. Schmidt said. \u201cSociety is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.\u201d But to protect older people more at risk, he called on the C.D.C. committee to also integrate the agency\u2019s own \u201csocial vulnerability index.\u201d The index includes 15 measures derived from the census, such as overcrowded housing, lack of vehicle access and poverty, to determine how urgently a community needs health support, with the goal of reducing inequities. In a new analysis of the states\u2019 preliminary vaccine plans, Dr. Schmidt found that at least 18 states intended to apply the index. Tennessee, for one, has indicated that it will reserve some of its early allotments for disadvantaged communities. Still, some people believe it is wrong to give racial and socioeconomic equity more weight than who is most likely to die. \u201cThey need to have bombproof, fact-based, public-health-based reasons for why one group goes ahead of another,\u201d said Chuck Ludlam, a former Senate aide and biotech industry lobbyist who protested putting essential workers ahead of older people in comments to the committee. \u201cThey have provided no explanation here that will withstand public scrutiny.\u201d Further complicating matters, the different priority groups discussed by the C.D.C. committee are overlapping \u2014 many essential workers have high-risk conditions, and some are older than 65. Some states have suggested that they will prioritize only essential workers who come face to face with the public, while others have not prioritized them at all. Even some people whose allegiance lies with one group have made the case that others should have an earlier claim on the vaccine. Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 1.3 million grocery and food processing workers, said that despite the high rate of infection among his members, he thought that older adults should go first. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: Everybody\u2019s got a grandmother or grandfather,\u201d Mr. Perrone said. \u201cAnd I do believe almost everybody in this country would want to protect them, or their aging parents.\u201d But Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine\u2019s top public health official, said he respectfully disagreed, repeating the explanation he had given his in-laws \u2014 who are older but in good health and able to socially distance. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve told them: \u2018You know what? I\u2019m sorry, but there are others that I need to get this vaccine to first, so that when you guys get vaccinated, the world you come back into is ready to receive you.\u2019\u201d All these plans are, of course, unfurling with essential information still unknown.Many state officials said that as on-the-ground realities emerge, they fully expect their plans to evolve. One uncertainty: given the high rates of apprehension swirling around this vaccine, how many people in the early groups will actually line up for it? \u201cIf a high proportion of essential workers decline to get the vaccine, states will have to quickly move onto the next group anyway,\u201d said Dr. Prosser, the University of Michigan health analyst. \u201cBecause once the vaccines arrive, they will have to be used in a certain amount of time before they degrade.\" Additional work by Jugal K.

    "article_text": "\u2018Natural Immunity\u2019 From Covid Is Not Safer Than a Vaccine On the heels of last month\u2019s news of stunning results from Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s experimental Covid-19 vaccines, Senator Rand Paul tweeted a provocative comparison. The new vaccines were 90 percent and 94.5 percent effective, Mr. Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said. But \u201cnaturally acquired\u201d Covid-19 was even better, at 99.9982 percent effective, he claimed. Mr. Paul is one of many people who, weary of lockdowns and economic losses, have extolled the benefits of contracting the coronavirus. The senator was diagnosed with the disease this year and has argued that surviving a bout of Covid-19 confers greater protection than getting vaccinated. The trouble with that logic is that it\u2019s difficult to predict who will survive an infection unscathed, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. Given all of the unknowns \u2014 like a region\u2019s hospital capacity, or the strength of a person\u2019s immune response \u2014\u00a0choosing the disease over the vaccine is \u201ca very bad decision,\u201d she said. The primary advantage of a vaccine is that it\u2019s predictable and safe, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been optimally tailored to generate an effective immune response.\u201d But what do we know about how the immunity from a prior infection compares with the protection given by the new vaccines? And what if you have already had Covid \u2014 is it safe to be vaccinated? We asked experts to weigh in on the latest evidence. The short answer: We don\u2019t know. But Covid-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and they are a far safer bet, experts said. Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does. Early evidence suggests that the Covid-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies \u2014 one marker of immune response \u2014 in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19. In other cases, however, a natural infection is more powerful than a vaccine. For example, having mumps \u2014 which can, in rare cases, cause fertility problems in men \u2014 generates lifelong immunity, but some people who have received one or two doses of the vaccine still get the disease. To Mr. Paul\u2019s point: Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection. But there is a \u201cmassive dynamic range\u201d in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels. In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. \u201cThose people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would,\u201d said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed. With a vaccine, everyone gets the same dose. \u201cWe know the dose that is being administered, and we know that that dose is effective at eliciting an immune response,\u201d Dr. Gommerman said. \u201cSo that becomes a variable that\u2019s taken off the table when you get the vaccine.\u201d The experts were unanimous in their answer: Covid-19 is by far the more dangerous option. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that one is less problematic for the body to recover from them than the other \u2014 there\u2019s more risk with natural infection,\u201d said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. People who are obese, or who have diseases like diabetes are particularly susceptible to severe cases of Covid-19. On average, the virus seems to be less risky for younger people, and women tend to fare better than men. But beyond those broad generalizations, doctors don\u2019t know why some people get very sick and die while others have no symptoms. For example, people who harbor certain mutations in immune genes are more susceptible to the disease, several studies have shown. \u201cSo there\u2019s a risk factor that has nothing to do with age,\u201d Dr. Gommerman said. In a study of more than 3,000 people, ages 18 to 34, who were hospitalized for Covid, 20 percent required intensive care and 3 percent died. \u201cIt\u2019s true that most people aren\u2019t going to be hospitalized, most people aren\u2019t going to get in the intensive care unit or die,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who represents the American Academy of Pediatrics at the meetings of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But \u201cnobody is immune to severe disease,\u201d she said. And even if people are not at high risk of Covid themselves, their friends or family could be. As many as one in three people who recover from Covid have chronic complaints, including exhaustion and a racing heart, for months afterward. This includes people under 35 with no previous health conditions. Some survivors of Covid also show troubling signs that their body has turned on itself, with symptoms similar to those of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Covid vaccines, in contrast, carry little known risk. They have been tested in tens of thousands of people with no serious side effects \u2014 at least so far. \u201cOnce you start vaccinating millions, you might find very, very rare events,\u201d Dr. Hanage said. \u201cBut we have to know that they are very, very rare and much more rare than the adverse events associated with natural infection.\u201d A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. It\u2019s safe, and probably even beneficial, for anyone who has had Covid to get the vaccine at some point, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing deleterious about getting a boost to an immune response that you\u2019ve had before,\u201d Dr. Pepper said. \u201cYou could get an actually even better immune response by boosting whatever immunity you had from the first infection by a vaccine.\u201d In fact, at a meeting on Wednesday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said up to 10 percent of participants in clinical trials for the vaccines had been infected with the virus without knowing it. Their immune responses to the vaccine are being analyzed, he said. If you\u2019ve already had Covid-19, you can afford to wait awhile for the vaccine. Studies from Dr. Pepper\u2019s team and others have shown that the immune response evolves over the first few months after infection, but everyone who has had Covid has some level of protection during that time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see anybody who didn\u2019t develop some sort of an immune response,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think those people need to rush out and go get the vaccine in the same way that people who are highly susceptible really do.\u201d The A.C.I.P., which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine distribution, said at a meeting on Wednesday that people who had not been infected should get priority over those who contracted the virus in the past 90 days. \u201cAt some point we\u2019ll need to figure out whether 90 days is the right number,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said. But for now, \u201cpeople who have evidence of infection recently should probably not be vaccinated at first in line because there\u2019s so little vaccine available.\u201d",

    "article_text": "\u2018Nobody Sees Us\u2019: Testing-Lab Workers Strain Under Demand In March, April Abbott dragged a hospital bed into her office at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Ind. In the nine months since, she has slept in it a half-dozen times while working overnight in her clinical microbiology laboratory, where a team of some 40 scientists toils around the clock running coronavirus tests. These all-night stints in the lab pull Dr. Abbott, the director of microbiology at Deaconess, away from her husband and three children, the oldest of whom is 8. A couple of times a week, she heads home for dinner, then drives back to work after the kids have gone to bed. She is at the lab when machines break. She is there to vet testing protocols for the lab. She is there when new testing sites open, flooding the lab with more samples to process. \u201cI do it because there is always more work to be done than the hours to do it in,\u201d she said. Nearly a year into a pandemic that has claimed more than 272,000 American lives, some 192 million tests for the coronavirus have been processed nationwide. Millions more will be needed to detect and contain the virus in the months ahead. Behind these staggering figures are thousands of scientists who have been working nonstop to identify the coronavirus in the people it infects. Across the nation, testing teams are grappling with burnout, repetitive-stress injuries and an overwhelming sense of doom. As supply chains sputter and laboratories rush to keep pace with diagnostic demand, experts warn that the most severe shortage stymieing America\u2019s capacity to test is not one that can be solved by a wider production line or a more efficient machine. It is a dearth of human power: the dwindling ranks in a field that much of the public does not know even exists. When shortages arise, \u201cthere\u2019s workarounds for almost everything else,\u201d said Karissa Culbreath, the medical director and infectious disease division chief at TriCore Reference Laboratories in New Mexico. \u201cBut people are irreplaceable.\u201d In the absence of trained workers to process and analyze the nation\u2019s tests, America\u2019s diagnostic infrastructure will not merely wrinkle and slow, experts said. It will collapse. \u201cDoctors and nurses are very visible, but we work behind the scenes,\u201d said Marissa Larson, a medical laboratory scientist supervisor at the University of Kansas Health System. \u201cAnd we are underwater.\u201d The gold standard in coronavirus diagnostics hinges on a decades-old laboratory method called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. The method is a signal amplifier: It can copy genetic material, including fragments of the genome of the coronavirus, over and over until it reaches detectable levels, making the virus discoverable even when it is extremely scarce in the body. P.C.R. is the metric against which all new testing techniques are compared; in the diagnostic landscape, few can match its ability to root out infection. But such accuracy comes at a cost. Even highly automated forms of P.C.R. require people to handle tubes, babysit machines and scrutinize ambiguous results. P.C.R.-based coronavirus tests also deal in DNA, the molecular language in which the human genome is written. The coronavirus, however, stores its genetic information in a close cousin called RNA, which must first be carefully extracted from virus particles, then converted to its more testable counterpart before diagnostics can proceed. When laboratories are well stocked, P.C.R. diagnostics can run from start to finish in just a few hours. But since the spring, laboratories around the country have been hamstrung by severe, often unpredictable shortages of chemicals and plasticware needed for these protocols.  And caseloads have skyrocketed; America\u2019s testing capacity has increased since March, but it has been vastly overtaken by the demand for tests. \u201cThe spring pales in comparison to what we are experiencing now,\u201d said Dr. Culbreath, of TriCore, which has run more than 600,000 coronavirus tests. Amid the pandemonium, labs must still work through their queues for other infectious disease tests, including for sexually transmitted infections. \u201cLabs are trying to maintain our standard of operation with everything else, with a pandemic on top of it,\u201d Dr. Culbreath said. Darcy Velasquez, a medical technologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, where cases continue to surge, is fighting to keep pace with some of her institution\u2019s highest sample volumes yet. Her shifts in the lab begin at 5:30 a.m., sometimes to a double-door refrigerator already brimming with 500 tubes, each containing a fresh patient swab and a small volume of liquid \u2014\u00a0more than a full day\u2019s work for one person. Ms. Velasquez typically spends the first couple hours of her day frantically trying to clear as much of the backlog as she can before another batch arrives around 8 a.m., when the local clinic opens. As much as an hour of that time might be spent simply de-swabbing samples: manually unscrewing and rescrewing caps and plucking out swabs, all without contaminating one sample with the contents of another. \u201cSometimes you walk into these refrigerators full of specimens and you think, \u2018I don\u2019t even know where to start,\u2019\u201d Ms. Velasquez said. At Georgia\u2019s state public health laboratory, direct handling of patient samples must be done with extra safeguards to minimize the chances of exposing personnel to infectious virus. Taylor Smith, a virologist and technologist at the lab, spends a large fraction of her workday in a full-body gown, sleeve covers, two pairs of gloves, an N95 respirator and goggles. Simply donning it all is exhausting. And although Ms. Smith has long been deft with lab instruments, the work always feels high-stakes, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re constantly thinking about how to not contaminate yourself.\u201d To keep their experiments running, lab workers must be proficient mechanics. The instruments needed for diagnostic tests were not built to run continuously for months on end. But as more facilities transition to 24/7 testing, malfunctions and breakdowns have become more common, requiring people to fix them. Tyler Murray, a clinical laboratory scientist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, spends his days listening for telltale alarms \u2014 a sign that one of his instruments has failed or is low on chemical ingredients. \u201cI make sure I talk nicely to them,\u201d Mr. Murray said of the lab\u2019s machines, which he decorates with gleaming gold stars when they perform at their best. \u201cI say, \u2018Hey bud, you worked hard this week, I\u2019m proud of you.\u2019\u201d But morale is low among the humans. After 10-hour shifts at U.T.M.B., Mr. Murray heads home and lies on the floor beside his two cats, Arya and Cleo. \u201cThe fatigue builds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but feel it.\u201d The monotonous motions that lab workers engage in daily take a physical and mental toll. Technologists are nursing repetitive-use injuries, a result of hours of maneuvering tubes and pipettes, which take up and dispense liquids with the press of a plunger. Workers must also be vigilant sanitizers, pausing regularly to swap out soiled gloves, clear their workspaces of plastic debris and scour surfaces with harsh chemicals that leave their clothes freckled with stains. \u201cWe\u2019re accustomed to holding things up in the background,\u201d said Natalie Williams-Bouyer, the director of the division of clinical microbiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \u201cWe enjoy doing it because we know we\u2019re helping people.\u201d But the enduring anonymity of testing labs has begun to splinter some spirits. Elizabeth Stoeppler, a senior medical technologist in the molecular microbiology lab at the University of North Carolina\u2019s School of Medicine, said that an old volleyball injury, which inflamed a tendon in her elbow years ago, had flared up after months of long stints in the lab. A few of her co-workers are wrestling with carpal tunnel syndrome. Ansel Oommen, an artist and medical lab worker, has turned biohazard labels into an outlet for pandemic grief and trauma. The strain has begun to affect Ms. Stoeppler outside of the lab. She bolts awake at 3 a.m., panicked about the previous day\u2019s work. She recently started a prescription medication to improve her chances of getting a full night\u2019s sleep. \u201cThere\u2019s signs everywhere that say, \u2018Heroes work here,\u2019\u201d she said of her hospital. She loves her job, she added. \u201cBut nobody sees us. We\u2019re just in the basement, or in the back.\u201d On a good day in a diagnostics lab, the phone might ring only a few times, with messages from clinicians inquiring about samples. But when \u201cthings are going poorly, it just rings off the hook,\u201d said Rachael Liesman, the director of clinical microbiology at the University of Kansas Health System, where she frequently clocks 15-hour shifts. To keep the lab on track, Dr. Liesman has put in some hours running tests herself \u2014 a task that is not a part of her normal job description. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange to have your director on the bench,\u201d said Ms. Larson, a supervisor in the lab. \u201cWhen you see that, some flare guns should be going up.\u201d In mid-November, Dr. Liesman\u2019s lab suffered a three-day stretch during which a supply of chemicals nearly ran dry on a Friday, then a pair of machines failed on Saturday and Sunday. \u201cWe were basically drowning in specimens\u201d by Monday, she said. \u201cI was paged by three different providers while brushing my teeth.\u201d Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Morale in the labs has flagged as the country continues to shatter records for caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths. The nation\u2019s testing experts know these statistics better than anyone: They count the numbers themselves, sample by sample. But they are also easy targets of criticism and complaint. \u201cThere is always this undercurrent of, it\u2019s never good enough,\u201d said Dr. Abbott, of Deaconess Hospital in Indiana. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating. We\u2019re working as hard as we can.\u201d Chelsa Ashley, a medical laboratory scientist at Deaconess, aches to be home with her three children, to whom she is a single mother, after 13-hour shifts in the lab. Once there, she struggles to leave her work behind. \u201cThere\u2019s that panicked feeling that I should have stayed to take care of our community samples,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s guilt, when you walk away.\u201d In the past few months, Ms. Ashley\u2019s children, who are 18, 13 and 10, have had to become substantially more self-sufficient. Shaylan, her youngest, rouses herself from bed at 5:50 a.m. every day to spend a few moments with her mother before she heads off to work. \u201cEven if it\u2019s only 10 minutes, it\u2019s 10 minutes that we talk,\u201d Ms. Ashley said. \u201cThat is one thing that has not changed.\u201d For some, the tidal wave of stress brought on by the pandemic has proved untenable. Since March, scientists have trickled out of laboratories, leaving chasms of expertise in a field that for years has struggled to recruit fresh talent. Joanne Bartkus, the former director of the Minnesota Department of Public Health Laboratory, retired from her position in May after a dozen years on the job. She pinned one of the pandemic\u2019s crucial inflection points to March 6, the day President Trump publicly remarked that \u201canybody that wants a test can get a test.\u201d \u201cThat was when the poop hit the fan,\u201d Dr. Bartkus said. Within about a week, her team went from receiving fewer than a dozen coronavirus testing samples each day to being inundated with roughly 1,000 daily specimens. It was unlike anything Dr. Bartkus had seen in her years at the institution. In 2009, the year of the H1N1 flu pandemic, Minnesota\u2019s public health laboratory tested about 6,000 patient samples. This spring, it broke that record in a couple of weeks. Dr. Bartkus, who is 65, had already planned to retire before the year was up. By the time April came, she had hastened her timeline to May: \u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long before I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m done with this.\u2019\u201d In interviews, several scientists noted that they were struggling to fill vacancies in their labs, some that were left open by overwhelmed technologists who had recently quit their jobs. While the need for such workers has grown in recent years, the number of training programs that build these skill sets has dropped. \u201cMedical technologists are a dying breed,\u201d Ms. Stoeppler, of the University of North Carolina, said. In Indiana, Dr. Abbott, of Deaconess Hospital, said her team had already performed more than 100,000 tests for the coronavirus. But the most chaotic months are most likely still ahead. For the first time in nine years, Dr. Abbott is doing hands-on work in the lab to help her staff cope with rising demand. She has yet to take more than a day off at a time since the pandemic\u2019s start, but insists that she can soldier on: \u201cThis is out of the sheer will of not wanting to be beaten by this pandemic.\u201d In the mini-refrigerator in her office, next to rotating bags of salad greens and a small cavalry of Diet Cokes, sits an unopened bottle of champagne that she purchased in March, intending to uncork it upon reaching a worthy testing milestone. Nothing has yet felt like enough. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what will feel like a reason to celebrate at this point,\u201d Dr. Abbott said. \u201cAsk me after the next 100,000 tests.\u201d [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

    "article_text": "Park With Covid Memorial Is Rising on Site of Former Toxic Dump JERSEY CITY, N.J. \u2014 Of all the toxic dumps in New Jersey, perhaps none was more infamous than PJP Landfill. It was here, at the edges of the Hackensack River in Jersey City, that underground fires erupted spontaneously for more than a decade, belching acrid smoke so thick it could snarl traffic on an adjacent bridge, the Pulaski Skyway, a key link for commuters to New York City. Firefighters tried dousing the smoldering land in the mid-1980s with 300,000 gallons of water a day, but residents complained that the spraying did not help.  A reputed mobster who had used the property when it was owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark even claimed that it was the final resting place of the world\u2019s most notorious Teamster: Jimmy Hoffa. That was then. Now, 30 years after the dump was held up as the poster child for toxic nightmares by the New Jersey congressman who wrote the Superfund law, plans for a phoenixlike rebirth await. It is about to be added to the ranks of wastelands reinvented as wonderlands, joining Fresh Kills on Staten Island, Mount Trashmore in Virginia and Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong. The site, which was designated a Superfund priority in 1983, is being converted into a public park with one of the nation\u2019s first memorials to victims of Covid-19. As part of a $10 million makeover, more than 500 trees will be planted in a grove of the newly named Skyway Park \u2014 one for every Jersey City resident who has died of the coronavirus, the mayor, Steven M. Fulop, announced on Thursday. Each person\u2019s name will also be included on a memorial wall, giving relatives of the dead a place to mourn. Many families were unable to observe traditional funeral rituals as the pandemic ravaged the Northeast. \u201cWe wanted to do something significant for those families that didn\u2019t get to grieve properly, and we\u2019re taking a step forward in that direction,\u201d Mr. Fulop said. \u201cIt has been a tough year for the city.\u201d For Mr. Fulop, the pain is personal. His grandmother died of Covid-19, and the City Council lost one of its members to the virus in April, Michael Yun. Vernon Richardson, who was an aide to Mr. Yun, said the park would \u201crepresent the resiliency of the city \u2014 everyone from those who died to those who loved them to those who just had a bad 2020.\u201d The site, polluted by hazardous chemicals when it was used as an industrial landfill in the 1970s, has been remediated and capped to make it safe for visitors, but extra soil will be brought in for planting. Once the park is complete \u2014 likely next summer or fall \u2014 walkways will wend along the river, through a pollinator garden and beside green spaces lined with flowers and reedy grasses native to the low-lying wetland area. A pedestrian bridge designed in the image of the Pulaski will connect two sides of the 32-acre site, which is bisected by a stream known as the Sip Avenue Ditch. A formal Covid-19 memorial installation will be erected beneath the bridge; visitors will be able to walk between the rows of trees on paths that run perpendicular to the main promenade. \u201cTo come into Jersey City from this west side, and to see a grove of trees, is going to be a beautiful thing,\u201d said Mira Prinz-Arey, a Jersey City councilwoman. \u201cIt will be improving the quality of life for our residents in the area who have basically no green space at all.\u201d The idea for the park was planted more than 12 years ago when Bill Matsikoudis, the city\u2019s former top lawyer, proposed buying the property. The $12.7 million purchase was finalized in 2012. \u201cTo see a place that constituted one of the most polluted parcels in the United States of America be returned to nature \u2014 a place where trees and wetlands and egrets can make a home \u2014 is extraordinary,\u201d said Mr. Matsikoudis, who ran for mayor against Mr. Fulop, a fellow Democrat, in 2017. The memorial grove of trees, Mr. Matsikoudis added, is \u201cfitting in so many ways.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a sign of life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring oxygen into a community that was choked for so long.\u201d A public housing complex sits across a four-lane highway from the landfill, at the edge of the Marion neighborhood, an historically Italian enclave. Decades ago, neighbors held community meetings and demonstrations, demanding action that eventually paved the way for emergency funds that were used to put out the fires for good. On Thursday, as politicians and environmentalists gathered next to the river, they invoked that past and noted that the wheels of environmental justice often turn slowly. \u201cIn a sad way,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Dea, a Hudson County commissioner who was on the Jersey City City Council in the 1980s, \u201cyou have to wait 35 years to see the end of that process.\u201d The park is a key element of a longer-term goal: creating a walkway along the Hackensack River that would stretch more than 10 miles from Bayonne north to Secaucus. A similar planned walkway, the Hudson Essex Greenway, would connect Jersey City, Secaucus, Kearny, Newark, Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge and Montclair. Bill Sheehan, who leads the Hackensack Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental group, noted the importance of creating open vistas in communities crowded with tall buildings. Eagles, he said, now nest in nearby Kearny. \u201cWhen I was a little boy living in Jersey City, the idea of an eagle anywhere near Jersey City was totally off the rails,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got eagles, we\u2019ve got plenty of fish in the river.\u201d Still, the site\u2019s industrial past is never far from mind. The Pulaski\u2019s 3.5-mile black-steel span and smokestacks from a power plant across the river dominate the horizon. Planes headed to and from nearby Newark Liberty International Airport leave streaks of smoky white entrails in the sky. The adjacent lots hold an imposing distribution warehouse and an e-commerce company. And, just maybe, Hoffa\u2019s grave. Phillip (Brother) Moscato, a reputed member of the Genovese crime family who grew up in Jersey City\u2019s Marion section and died in 2014, reportedly said in interviews that Hoffa was buried in a plot under the Skyway, inside a 55-gallon drum. The body of the Teamsters union boss, who disappeared in 1975 near Detroit, has never been found. A half-mile away, a large sculpture of a man holding a rolled-up green carpet stands in the shadow of the Skyway\u2019s on-ramp, an image made famous by its appearance in the opening credits of the HBO Mafia hit \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d Steve Krinsky, chairman of the Skyway Park Conservancy, said it was time to bury that sordid chapter for good. \u201cSomeday soon, Skyway Park will be an open, natural area along the shores of this awesome and cleaner-than-ever river, a part of the rebirth of the green coast of Jersey City, a stop along the Hackensack River Walkway and a world-class park,\u201d Mr. Krinsky said. \u201cToday is only the first step.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Further Slowdown in Job Creation Sets Off Economic Alarms The American job engine has slowed significantly, stranding millions who have yet to find work after being idled by the pandemic, and offering fresh evidence that the recovery is faltering. The Labor Department reported Friday that employers added 245,000 jobs in November, fewer than half the number created in October. The pace of hiring has now diminished for five straight months. While many of those knocked out of a job early in the pandemic have been rehired, there are roughly 10 million fewer jobs than there were in February. Many of the unemployed are weeks away from losing benefits that have sustained them, with emergency assistance approved by Congress last spring set to expire at the end of the year. The latest sign of economic headwinds arrived as members of Congress struggled to reach agreement on a new aid package. A bipartisan group of legislators has put forward a $900 billion proposal, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said the disappointing jobs report should add momentum to negotiations. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., warning of \u201ca dark winter,\u201d emphasized the urgency of congressional action. \u201cThis is a grim jobs report,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt shows an economy that is stalling. It confirms we remain in the midst of one of the worst economic and jobs crises in modern history.\u201d Covid-19 caseloads have doubled in the past month and are expected to rise further, discouraging people from in-store shopping and leading to new restrictions. And in much of the country, colder weather is likely to impede outdoor dining, which many restaurants have depended on. \u201cWe\u2019re in an unusual position right now in the economy,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at the accounting firm Evercore ISI. \u201cFar off in the distance there is sunlight\u201d because of progress on coronavirus vaccines, he said, but until then, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a few of the toughest months of this pandemic, and there will be a lot of scars left to heal.\u201d One of the longer-lasting wounds is likely to be a large pool of people \u2014 many still of prime working age \u2014 who drop out of the labor force, remaining sidelined even when opportunities return. The share of those 16 or older who are in a job or actively seeking one fell in November to 61.5 percent and remains far below levels seen before the pandemic. The drop has been especially noticeable among women, who are heavily represented in the service industries hit hardest by the pandemic \u2014 like retailing and dining \u2014 and have been more likely to leave the labor market because of family responsibilities. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate dipped in November, to 6.7 percent from 6.9 percent, but that was primarily because more people gave up looking for work. \u201cTemporary unemployment fell, but permanent job loss inched up,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the job search site Indeed. Easily won gains have already occurred, as employers recalled briefly displaced workers, making subsequent progress harder. \u201cMeasures of longer-term damage worsened slightly in November,\u201d he said. Last month\u2019s job totals were dragged down in part by the loss of 93,000 temporary census workers, unneeded now that the official counting has wound down. Yet even in the private sector, \u201cmomentum is slowing,\u201d said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. While distress can be found in nearly every pocket of the labor market, the pain has been unevenly distributed. This downturn, like previous ones, is expected to widen wealth and income gaps and hurt people with the least education. Joblessness among Black and Hispanic workers was significantly higher last month than it was for whites, in part because they hold a disproportionate share of service jobs. Gabriela Villagomez-Morales, 36, was laid off from her position as an assistant teacher at a day care center in Tacoma, Wash., after the pandemic arrived in March and schools shut down. Ms. Villagomez-Morales, a single mother of four, was unable to pay the $1,000 rent for her house, so she packed up and moved in with her sister and her two children. She has applied for jobs at restaurants and child care centers. Although she has yet to find work, she worries what will happen to her children if she does. \u201cIt would be difficult, because someone would have to watch my kids if I\u2019m not at home,\u201d Ms. Villagomez-Morales said. \u201cChild care is really expensive.\u201d There have been some signs of energy in the labor market. With the pandemic keeping shoppers out of stores and employees working from home, it\u2019s no surprise that some of November\u2019s biggest gains were in warehousing and moving goods and in health care jobs. Employers in business and professional services also continued hiring, although large sections of the economy \u2014 like hospitality, travel and entertainment \u2014 are still floundering. Becky Frankiewicz, president of the staffing and placement company ManpowerGroup North America, said a survey of all publicly posted jobs showed 11 million openings in November, a million more than the previous month. \u201cWe continue to see week-over-week job growth,\u201d Ms. Frankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near where we were, yet we continue to limp ahead with recovery.\u201d There has been seasonal hiring, but the composition is different from what it was in previous years. Instead of adding positions at cash registers, on sales floors and in call centers, employers are scooping up people to work in warehouses and to handle customer service calls from home. \u201cWe\u2019ve placed several thousand associates last week for seasonal holiday push, and there are a lot of openings for work-from-home opportunities,\u201d said Amy Glaser, senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco. Ilias Simpson, the chief executive of Radial, which handles e-commerce operations for retailers and other businesses, said the company had hired 15,000 seasonal workers, nearly tripling its North American work force for the holidays. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hiring since October,\u201d Mr. Simpson said, noting that Radial expected to hire 40 percent more people than it did last year. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of peak season.\u201d He plans to add several thousand workers over the next six months, some in permanent positions. Last year, when the unemployment rate had settled below 4 percent, news that employers had added nearly a quarter of million people to payrolls in a single month would have been greeted with enthusiasm. But circumstances have changed radically in a short time. Now millions more people are unemployed. And the broadest measure of joblessness, which includes workers who have part-time work but would prefer full-time employment or have given up the job hunt, has been at 12 percent for two months. If job creation doesn\u2019t pick up, it will take more than three years to get back to where the labor market was before the pandemic hit. Wendi Wilson, 54, has been out of work since March. She had worked for six years as a brand ambassador helping companies sell products at conferences on the Las Vegas Strip, making roughly $35,000 a year. Her state unemployment benefit amounted to $115 a week, which was augmented for a while by a $600 federal supplement before it ran out in the summer. That left Ms. Wilson struggling to pay the $1,170 rent for her two-bedroom apartment in Summerlin, Nev., and a $460 monthly car payment. In August, her unemployment benefits stopped, but she said she hadn\u2019t been able to reach the unemployment office to get the extension she is entitled to. So Ms. Wilson has been using her savings to pay bills, including cashing in her retirement account. She is also relying on donations from friends. \u201cI don\u2019t have any savings left, and that\u2019s scary to me because of my age,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to having to depend on others to help me, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Gillian Friedman and Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "The Virus Is Devastating the U.S., and Leaving an Uneven Toll HOUSTON \u2014 The United States is winding up a particularly devastating week, one of the very worst since the coronavirus pandemic began nine months ago. On Friday, a national single-day record was set, with more than 226,000 new cases. It was one of many data points that illustrated the depth and spread of a virus that has killed more than 278,000 people in this country, more than the entire population of Lubbock, Texas, or Modesto, Calif., or Jersey City, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s just an astonishing number,\u201d said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of this really severe wave and I think as we go through the day to day of this pandemic, it can be easy to lose sight of how massive and deep the tragedy is.\u201d In California, where daily case reports have tripled in the last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a new round of regional stay-at-home orders to address a mounting crisis over intensive-care beds. Some counties in the Bay Area said they were enacting tough new restrictions this weekend, before the state rules come into effect. And in South Florida, which is in the early stages of a new surge, physicians and politicians alike worried that there might not be enough resources to treat the sick. As the virus has spread, infectious-disease experts have gained a better understanding of who among the nation\u2019s nearly 330 million residents is the most vulnerable. Nursing home deaths have consistently represented about 40 percent of the country\u2019s Covid-19 deaths since midsummer, even as facilities kept visitors away and took other precautions and as the share of infections related to long-term care facilities fell substantially. Underlying conditions have played a pivotal role in determining who survives the virus. Americans who have conditions like diabetes, hypertension and obesity \u2014 about 45 percent of the population \u2014 are more vulnerable. And new evidence has emerged that people in lower-income neighborhoods experienced higher exposure risk to the virus because of their need to work outside the home. \u201cThe pandemic is us,\u201d said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, who added that part of the word \u201cpandemic\u201d derives from \u201cdemos,\u201d ancient Greek for \u201cpeople.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same word that gives us \u2018demography\u2019 or \u2018epidemic.\u2019 The pandemic is collectively all of our actions.\u201d Upticks on both coasts have more than offset the progress in the Upper Midwest, where new case numbers have started to fall. Some places in the Northeast are now reporting more cases each day than they were in the spring, in part because testing was limited then. Rhode Island is averaging more than 1,000 cases a day for the first time. In New York State, cases have reached record levels around Buffalo and Rochester, with no signs of slowing. More questions than answers remain about the virus and which people it kills, and why. There has been no modern pandemic of this scale and sort for infectious-disease experts and public health officials to draw from. As with cancer or even the common cold, no one has solved all of Covid-19\u2019s many mysteries. \u201cYou may be a person with cancer who gets exposed to very little virus and you\u2019re going to get a severe presentation,\u201d said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, an expert in infectious diseases at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. \u201cBut you may be a young person without comorbidities who gets a massive exposure and you may get a severe presentation as well.\u201d Months ago, there was a notion that the virus was a big-city phenomenon, as New York, Detroit, New Orleans and other urban centers were hard hit. It has become clear that is no longer true, if it ever was. The virus has torn through places on the southwestern border with Mexico, where cases are spiking around Nogales, Ariz., and up on the northern border with Canada, too, where the Roseau, Minn., area has set records. Los Angeles and Miami are current hot spots, but so are Ziebach County, S.D., and Deaf Smith County, Texas. The poor, in particular, have been more at risk than the rich, according to analyses of those who have been sickened by the virus or succumbed to it. And new studies have suggested that the reason the virus has affected Black and Latino communities more than white neighborhoods is tied to social and environmental factors, not any innate vulnerability. According to one recent study of cellphone data, people in lower-income neighborhoods experienced significantly higher exposure risk to the virus because they were compelled to go to jobs outside their homes. Through early May, the number of people in the most affluent neighborhoods who stayed home all day increased by 27 percentage points, while the number in the lowest-income areas increased by 11 percentage points, according to an analysis by social epidemiologists at the Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cNeighborhoods matter,\u201d said Molly Scannell Bryan, a research assistant professor at the Institute for Minority Health Research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cIn Chicago, both your race and the race of your neighborhood affected where high death rates were.\u201d Men are dying from the coronavirus at higher rates than women, data has shown. Some researchers suggest that one explanation is that men are generally in poorer health than women, more likely to smoke or have heart disease. By early December, at least 135,000 men had died from the virus in the United States, compared with at least 114,000 women, according to federal data. There are differences by state and by city, however. Women are more likely than men to die of the virus in Connecticut, but men are more likely than women to die in Arizona, New Jersey and the District of Columbia, according to research from the GenderSci Lab at Harvard, which created a tracker on gender disparities related to Covid-19. One of the key at-risk demographics is older Americans who live in nursing homes and similar facilities. More than 787,000 residents and employees of at least 28,000 nursing homes and long-term care centers for older people in the United States have contracted the coronavirus, according to a New York Times analysis based on federal, state, local and facility-level data. Of those infected, more than 106,000 have perished. The virus is known to be particularly lethal to those in their 60s and older who have underlying health conditions. And it can spread easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room. After her husband\u2019s nursing home in Boone, N.C., stopped allowing family members to enter the facility because of coronavirus risks, Doris Greer stood outside his window three or four times a week. They had a routine. Richard H. Greer, 79, who had heart problems and could not walk after a stroke, would call and ask his wife to bring their dogs, a Rat Terrier and \u201cBoston Weiner\u201d named Macy and Teton. Ms. Greer would drive over and a nursing home employee would slide Mr. Greer\u2019s window open just a little bit, and the two would talk through the screen. Since March, Ms. Greer had prayed that the coronavirus would not make its way into her husband\u2019s facility, but she thought her husband was well protected because he rarely, if ever, left his room. Then one day in the fall, she arrived at the window and a worker told her that her husband had tested positive and that they could not talk. His condition soon deteriorated. She was permitted to go into the facility briefly in September in protective gear. Mr. Greer was on oxygen and unconscious. Joined by her sister, she then went back outside and sat by his window and talked to him. She stayed until it was very late and then came back to the window the next morning. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he could hear me,\u201d Ms. Greer said. \u201cI just told him he was OK and that I loved him.\u201d She was still there at the window when he died later that day.

Gavin Newsom said the new stay-at-home orders would go into effect region by region as intensive care units fill up. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, we\u2019ll continue to see our death rate climb.\u201d Over the past week, there has been an average of 16,821 cases per day, an increase of 60 percent from the average two weeks earlier. Here\u2019s what we know about the measures. The new order divides the state into five regions: Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, the Bay Area, Greater Sacramento and Rural Northern California. Once each region\u2019s I.C.U. capacity falls below 15 percent, residents will be required to stay home except for essential tasks and outdoor exercise. Most businesses will have to shut down, including in-person dining, salons and sports events. Hotels in affected areas will be allowed to operate only \u201cin support of critical infrastructure services.\u201d Customer numbers in retail stores will be capped at 20 percent of their legal capacity. Some cities and counties in the state have already imposed new restrictions, including Los Angeles County, which issued a similar stay-at-home order last week. And in the hardest-hit areas, which are currently under the state\u2019s purple tier of restrictions and encompass more than 90 percent of the state\u2019s residents, a limited stay-at-home order has prohibited people from leaving their homes for nonessential tasks between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. since Nov. 21. [See our map of coronavirus cases in California by county.] Regional stay-at-home orders would take effect if intensive-care capacity in an area dips below a 15 percent threshold. None of the regions have met that threshold yet, but all are expected to hit it soon. The orders will take effect in each region 24 hours after it meets that mark \u2014 and the soonest the restrictions could be imposed is Sunday. On Friday, some areas decided to implement the measures even though they had not hit the threshold. A stay-at-home order for a group of counties in the Bay Area will begin on Sunday at 10 p.m. Once imposed, each region\u2019s order will last for at least three weeks. In order for the restrictions to end, that region\u2019s forecast I.C.U. capacity for the next four weeks must reach 15 percent or higher. Each county would then return to the existing reopening tier system. San Francisco\u2019s order is set to end on Jan. 4, but officials said the restrictions could be lifted sooner if the forecast for I.C.U. capacities increased. [Sign up for our California Today newsletter, for top news and features from across one of America\u2019s largest and most dynamic states.] Currently, none of the five regions has hit the mark to impose the new restrictions, but some counties, like San Francisco, have voluntarily opted in as a precaution. You can see which counties are in each region here. Updated Dec. 7, 2020 The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education. According to California\u2019s reported data, the I.C.U. capacity remaining as of Thursday for the five regions is: Northern California: 18.60 percent Bay Area: 25.30 percent Greater Sacramento: 22.20 percent San Joaquin Valley: 19.70 percent Southern California: 20.60 percent In March, the shelter-in-place order was statewide and prohibited residents from leaving their homes for nonessential tasks. The order this time is less restrictive. Some shops that were ordered closed last time will be able to remain open, with customer capacity capped at 20 percent. Some beaches and the parking lots of state parks were also closed in March, but they remain open now. [See the coronavirus restrictions across the U.S. here.] Mr. Newsom said parks and beaches would remain open, and he encouraged residents to go outside and use them, and even to take outdoor fitness classes. Once the region\u2019s stay-at-home order goes into effect, the following will close: Outdoor dining (indoor dining was already suspended for counties in the most-restrictive purple tier) Hair salons, nail salons and other personal care services Playgrounds Outdoor museums, zoos, aquariums, movie theaters and wineries Restaurants will still be open for takeout and delivery. Religious services will still be allowed outdoors, and any schools that have been allowed to reopen can continue to operate. Outdoor exercise, film and TV production and professional sports without live audiences can also continue. The California Department of Public Health has issued a travel advisory encouraging residents to avoid nonessential travel. If you are arriving in California from another state or country, California officials advise a self-quarantine of 14 days. As it has since the spring, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise postponing travel and staying home to prevent spreading the virus. Before traveling to another state or country, be sure to check government websites there for any additional Covid-related restrictions or advisories. The new order prohibits private and public gatherings of any size. The rollout of new restrictions, particularly in Los Angeles County, has been confusing, and enforcement has been spotty.",

    "article_text": "Yes, People Are Traveling for the Holidays. Stop Shaming Them. Last month, a war erupted in America over whether to celebrate Thanksgiving if it involved visiting family and friends. My Twitter feed was filled with people railing against scenes of crowded airports, as if those traveling to see loved ones were attacking them personally. These angry judgments put people on the defensive. They fear they will be reproached for their choices. They\u2019re not wrong. When we see people gathering in groups or going about without a mask or engaging in other activities we deem unsafe, we condemn them. Too often, we do so publicly. Shaming occurs in private, too. I see family and friends scolding people for certain activities they engage in. Some of the activities are easy to denounce, like attending large indoor rallies. Others are smaller perceived infractions, like getting a massage or playing on a sports team. The anger is there either way. All of this judgment is counterproductive, even when the behavior in question is indisputably reckless. For one thing, drawing attention to aberrant unwanted behavior risks \u201cnormalizing\u201d it. Although very few parents refuse to immunize their children (only about 1 percent get no vaccines at all), widespread condemnation of the so-called anti-vaxxers makes it seem as if they are a significant movement. The same is true of the anti-lockdown protesters: They were small in number \u2014 indeed, most Americans were perfectly willing to comply with shelter-in-place policies \u2014 but the disproportionate news coverage of them made it seem otherwise. Another problem with judging people for engaging in risky behavior is that it leads to judging them for the consequences of that behavior. It\u2019s a small step from belittling people who don\u2019t take sufficient coronavirus precautions to belittling people for contracting Covid-19. Viewing illness as a personal failing is not only morally misguided; it\u2019s also damaging from a public health perspective. Many people don\u2019t want to find out if they are infected, even if they are sick, because they worry that others will wonder what they did \u201cwrong.\u201d Some who are infected even hide their status, for fear that those they\u2019ve been near will be angry at them for putting them at risk. Such fears are entirely rational. Lots of people get angry when they find themselves infected with the coronavirus, wanting to know which person they came into contact with is to blame. We don\u2019t play this \u201cblame game\u201d with influenza, even when it\u2019s an especially bad flu season. But we are doing it with Covid-19. The focus on blame is unhelpful, because what really matters is that people do as much as they reasonably can to prevent the spread of the disease, not that everyone adhere to the same set of rigid standards. I choose not to go inside friends\u2019 homes, but I do eat outdoors at restaurants; other people might do the opposite. What\u2019s important is that we all try to minimize risk. While some people may have legitimate reasons to be upset (say, if they were infected by a co-worker who refused to wear a mask or stay home after developing flulike symptoms), anger and hectoring are rarely the way to make things better. Shaming others might make you feel good about yourself, but it rarely corrects bad behavior. Indeed, it often backfires. It can harden feelings and drive bad behavior underground. That\u2019s exactly what we don\u2019t want. Consider adolescents and sex. We can tell young people never to have sex and then demean them if they do anyway and contract a disease or get pregnant. But the evidence suggests it\u2019s much more productive to talk about safe sex and to help them deal with any adverse consequences of having sex. This approach also makes it more likely they will come in for testing, counseling and treatment if they need it. Likewise, we can lecture people about eating more healthfully and stigmatize those who don\u2019t, but it rarely results in behavioral change. It\u2019s much more effective to assist them, compassionately, in determining what prevents them from making better decisions. The same is true of Covid-19 shaming. We can demand that people stop socializing and cancel their holidays entirely, but as we saw over Thanksgiving, that doesn\u2019t work. Many people traveling for the holiday had made their plans, bought their tickets and scheduled their vacation days many months before. It\u2019s not their fault that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally got around to putting out a warning about travel a week before the holiday. In addition, we too often fail to recognize that the rules aren\u2019t fair. Some gatherings are deemed acceptable; others are forbidden. Some services are deemed essential; others are not. The reasons for these decisions are seldom consistent. Lots of people were told that while it wasn\u2019t safe to gather with 10 relatives in their homes, it was still somehow permissible to gather with those same 10 people \u2014 and many, many others \u2014 in a restaurant or bar. It\u2019s understandable that people respond by fashioning a set of rules that makes more sense to them. We could also do a better job of appreciating that many people who don\u2019t meet our standards for safe behavior are unable to \u2014 not that they choose not to. Many people can\u2019t work at home. Many have to rely on public transportation. Many don\u2019t have the luxury of backyards for socializing. I can remember reading numerous articles early in the pandemic about how to make sure delivery food was virus-free. I wish there had been more articles about how to make sure all Americans got the food they need. I understand that Covid-19 shaming is rooted in frustration. We\u2019re angry about our inability to get a handle on the pandemic. But in our quest to scold and lay blame, even when we\u2019re publicly calling out truly bad actors, we\u2019re just making ourselves feel superior, which only makes it harder to achieve the solidarity needed for shared sacrifice. We can all do better; we\u2019re all in this together. This is just a virus, one that\u2019s too easily transmitted to stigmatize its effects. The only shame we should associate with Covid-19 is that our country has done so little to fight it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "article_text": "Many of us are stress eating because of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted everyday life, isolated people from friends and family, and spawned an economic crisis. On top of all that, it has also affected people\u2019s mental and physical health. A global survey conducted earlier this year confirms what many have already experienced firsthand: The virus and resulting lockdowns led to dramatic changes in health behaviors, with people around the world cutting back on physical activity and eating more junk foods. It has also worsened anxiety and disrupted sleep. And those who are obese, who already face increased health risks, may have fared the worst, the researchers found. While they tended to experience improvements in some aspects of their diets, they were also the most likely to report struggling with their weight and mental health.  The study, carried out by researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana, surveyed almost 8,000 adults across the globe, including people from 50 different countries and every state in America. The researchers found that the decline in healthy behaviors during the pandemic was fairly common regardless of geography. They found that most people became more sedentary, and many said they had given in to their food cravings. Consumption of sweetened beverages and sugary snack foods, for example, went up. About 27 percent of people said they had gained weight after the initial lockdowns went into effect. The findings, published in the journal Obesity, offer a cautionary lesson. With months to go before we can safely resume our pre-pandemic routines, now might be a good time to assess the healthy habits we may have let slip and to find new ways to be proactive about our physical and mental health.",

    "article_text": "Covid Survivors With Long-Term Symptoms Need Urgent Attention, Experts Say There is an urgent need to address long-term symptoms of the coronavirus, leading public health officials said this week, warning that hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of people worldwide might experience lingering problems that could impede their ability to work and function normally. In a two-day meeting Thursday and Friday, the federal government\u2019s first workshop dedicated to long-term Covid-19, public health officials, medical researchers and patients said the condition needed to be recognized as a syndrome, given a name and taken seriously by doctors. \u201cThis is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,\u201d Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, said at the conference on Thursday. While the number of people affected is still unknown, he said, if long-term symptoms afflict even a small proportion of the millions of people infected with the coronavirus, it is \u201cgoing to represent a significant public health issue.\u201d Such symptoms \u2014 ranging from breathing trouble to heart issues to cognitive and psychological problems \u2014 are already plaguing an untold number of people worldwide. Even for people who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, the aftermath can be long and grueling with a complex and lasting mix of symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently posted a list of some long-term symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, chest pain, brain fog and depression, but doctors and researchers said they still know little about the extent or cause of many of the problems, which patients will develop them or how to address them. Over the last several months, coronavirus patients with lingering, debilitating health issues have been widely referred to as \u201cCovid long-haulers.\u201d But some survivors and experts feel that name trivializes the experience, lessening its importance as a medical syndrome which doctors and insurers should recognize, diagnose and try to treat. One of the pressing issues patients and experts are now weighing is what official medical term should be adopted to describe the collection of post-Covid symptoms. \u201cWe need to dig in and do the work that needs to be done to help relieve the suffering and stop this madness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Saag, an infectious disease expert from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was a co-chair of a session. In an inadvertent but stark illustration of the difficulty of the recovery process, two of the four patients scheduled to speak at the meeting were unable to because they had recently been hospitalized. \u201cThose individuals had their acute illness several months ago and they\u2019ve been suffering pretty mightily since then,\u201d Dr. Saag said. \u201cAnd the fact that they\u2019re still struggling with this gives extra power to what we\u2019re trying to do today.\u201d Dr. John Brooks, the chief medical officer of the C.D.C.\u2019s Covid response, the co-chairman with Dr. Saag of one session, said he expected long-term post-Covid symptoms would affect \u201con the order of tens of thousands in the United States and possibly hundreds of thousands.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you were to ask me what do we know about this post-acute phase, I really am hard pressed to tell you that we know much. This is what we\u2019re really working on epidemiologically to understand what is it, how many people get it, how long does it last, what causes it, who does it affect, and then of course, what can we do to prevent it from happening.\u201d [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Presentations from Covid-19 survivors \u2014 including Dr. Peter Piot, a world-renowned infectious disease expert who helped discover the Ebola virus \u2014 made it clear that for many people, recovering from the disease is not like flipping a switch. Dr. Piot, who is the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a special adviser on Covid-19 research to the president of the European Commission, said he contracted the coronavirus in March and was hospitalized for a week in April. The acute phase of his illness involved some, but not all, of the classic disease symptoms. For example, his oxygen saturation was very low, but he did not develop shortness of breath or a cough until after he got home from the hospital. For the next month, he experienced a rapid heart rate several hours a day, he said. For nearly four months, he experienced extreme fatigue and insomnia. \u201cWhat I found most frustrating personally was that I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Dr. Piot, who now considers himself recovered except for needing more sleep than before his infection. \u201cI just had to wait for improvement.\u201d Chim\u00e9re Smith, 38, a teacher in Baltimore who has not been able to work since becoming sick in March, said she had struggled for months to have her symptoms, which included loss of vision in one eye, taken seriously by doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s been a harrowing task and the task and the journey continues,\u201d she said. Ms. Smith, who is Black, said it was especially important to inform people in underserved communities that long-term effects are \u201cas real and possible as dying from the virus itself.\u201d The condition, she said, \u201cnot only needs to be explored, but it needs to be explained to the same group of people who suffer with being stricken with it the most, and that\u2019s the minority population. I am not just here today for me; I am here for us.\u201d Hannah Davis, 32, a researcher and artist in Brooklyn, described neurological and cognitive symptoms that began in late March. \u201cI forgot my partner\u2019s name,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI would regularly pick up a hot pan, burn myself, put it down and literally do it again. I forgot how to shower. I forgot how to dress myself.\u201d Months later, some things have improved, but she still struggles to remember things, saying \u201cI feel like I am basically on a 48-hour memory cycle.\u201d Ms. Davis is part of a long-term Covid survivor group called Body Politic and said a survey of 3,800 of its members in 56 countries has found that 85 percent report cognitive dysfunction, 81 percent had numbness and other neurological sensations, nearly half had speech and language issues and nearly three-quarters had some difficulty working at their jobs. Clinics treating Covid survivors are seeing a striking number of people with brain fog and other thinking problems, as well as psychological issues, doctors participating in the workshop said. \u201cApproximately three months after their acute illness, more than half of our patients have at least a mild cognitive impairment,\u201d said Dr. Ann Parker, who co-directs a post-Covid clinic at Johns Hopkins. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing substantial mental health impairments.\u201d Dr. Janet Diaz, head of clinical care for the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 response, said the agency is planning a meeting focused on long-term coronavirus effects and will soon start collecting data on post-Covid symptoms and medical visits. She said that while doctors are accustomed to prolonged recovery challenges for people hospitalized for serious illnesses, the lingering symptoms in younger people and those who were not hospitalized for the coronavirus \u201curgently needs to be better understood and investigated.\u201d",

But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus. The agency also called for increased access to testing and quarantine for those who are exposed. Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers. Two days later, a committee of outside experts will convene to make recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration about whether to grant emergency approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.

She is one of the richest people in the world, a leading voice in global health and an advocate for women\u2019s economic empowerment. As a face of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she is also a lightning rod for critics who say billionaires have too much sway over public policy, as well as for conspiracy theorists who harbor darker fantasies. The Gateses have been sounding the alarm about infectious diseases \u2014 and the need to fund vaccination efforts \u2014 since the late 1990s. That was when, during travels in Africa and India, the extreme poverty they saw prompted them to reflect on how they might use their wealth to make a difference. \u201cWe just kept saying: \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Why isn\u2019t the infrastructure here for roads? Why aren\u2019t we seeing more people who are doing well economically? What\u2019s happened?\u2019\u201d Ms. Gates said. \u201cWe started to think about what philanthropy\u2019s role might be and realized that the best place to intervene, if you want somebody to live a full and productive life, was to start with health.\u201d Since then, the Gates Foundation has given away more than $55 billion, much of it directed at efforts to eradicate disease in the developing world. It has helped to all but wipe out polio, and has poured money into programs aimed at ensuring that poor countries have easy access to vaccines. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the foundation turned its attention to the vast and complex project of developing vaccines for the new virus, and ensuring that they could be widely distributed. So far, the foundation has contributed nearly $500 million to coronavirus response efforts. Earlier investments by the foundation are paying off as well \u2014 one of the drugmakers it previously funded, BioNTech, has developed a successful Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer. Ms. Gates is more optimistic today than she was a couple months ago. Vaccines that appear to be safe and effective are beginning to be deployed. Treatments for the virus have improved. And President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made beating back the pandemic his top priority. \u201cThe Biden administration will re-enter the global stage and be a participant in making sure the whole world gets vaccines,\u201d Ms. Gates said. She added that the virus team assembled by Mr. Biden was \u201ca very strong, eminent group who are wise and thoughtful and very reasonable.\u201d Yet Ms. Gates was realistic about the challenges ahead. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, disinformation is running rampant on social media, many Americans still refuse to wear masks, and cases are surging again. \u201cWe still have a stretch of very dark months ahead of us,\" she said. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity. You and Bill have been warning about the risk of pandemics for a long time. How has the last year diverged from your expectations? You can project out and think about what a pandemic might be like or look like, but until you live through it, it\u2019s pretty hard to know what the reality will be like. So I think we predicted quite well that, depending on what the disease was, it could spread very, very, very quickly. The spread did not surprise us. What did surprise us is we hadn\u2019t really thought through the economic impacts. What happens when you have a pandemic that\u2019s running rampant in populations all over the world? The fact that we would all be home, and working from home if we were lucky enough to do that. That was a piece that I think we hadn\u2019t really prepared for. What do you think should have been done earlier at the start of the pandemic? We can look at how this disease traveled around the world and see that the countries who locked down first, they\u2019re doing better. Many African countries saw it coming and locked it down early. Their replication rate just never got as high as many other countries. And that is a good thing. We should have said sooner that if you\u2019re going to go out, wear a mask. I mean, the fact we\u2019re even still debating that in the United States makes zero sense. Most people get in a car today and know that to save their own life, they ought to wear a seatbelt. Most people would agree that having drunken drivers on the road is a bad thing, not only individually but for us as a society, because it causes more deaths. Well, masks are just the right thing to do right now. It is insane that we\u2019re at this point in this pandemic, in the United States, and we\u2019re still debating whether people should wear a mask when they go in a store to buy their groceries. What do you believe are going to be the most serious challenges to conducting an effective and comprehensive vaccination campaign in this country and around the world? We do know how to get the vaccine out, even in very remote circumstances. Some of the vaccines will be much harder than others and require very substantial cold chains, so those will be hard to get out around the globe. But there are vaccines coming right behind those, so I\u2019m quite optimistic. The disinformation has been incredibly harsh, and it affects people\u2019s lives. But I\u2019m also hopeful that as the vaccine comes out and people see that it\u2019s safe and efficacious, they will start to take it so that they can go out and return to normal. To what do you attribute the rise in vaccine hesitancy? Is it as simple as disinformation? I think, quite honestly, the advent of social media. If you\u2019re a conspiracy theorist and you get connected to somebody else who maybe has heard of the autism problem that didn\u2019t really exist, those things start to connect, and then those conspiracies start to replicate. We\u2019re at a point of a lot of distrust in the country and all over the world. We know people are more polarized. Disinformation is just too easy to spread, and that\u2019s going to cost people their lives. Say I start to believe PizzaGate and I start clicking all the theories of PizzaGate. What I\u2019m going to get served up on my social media channel is lots more things about conspiracy theories. And if I don\u2019t have anybody pushing back on that, and I\u2019m going down that wormhole, I\u2019m going to start to believe more and more and more disinformation. That\u2019s just not good for society. Between social media and people\u2019s own anxiety and the polarized nature of our country, all these pieces have combined to make sort of a perfect storm around vaccine hesitancy. Are there some people who will never get vaccinated, never wear a mask? Yes. We\u2019re already seeing that in places in the country. But I think the more important question is: Will there be a broad set of people that will take this vaccine? And I think the answer to that will be yes. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: You and Bill have been subject of conspiracy theories, too. Why do you think they\u2019ve targeted you specifically? I don\u2019t know. I just think that fear is there, and so people are looking to point to somebody or some thing or some institution. And then once it lands on that person or institution, you get sort of a pile-on effect because of social media, and it\u2019s deeply, deeply concerning for society. Our democracy depends on facts, and we depend on having real facts out there to keep ourselves safe and healthy. Do you believe that the Trump administration\u2019s politicization of the vaccine development process is contributing to that hesitancy? Absolutely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was set up to give scientific information and guidance to health commissioners in every region of the United States. That agency needs to be left to do its job in terms of real scientific fact. And same thing with the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A. is our gold standard. It\u2019s how we know our vaccines are safe and efficacious. So they need to be independent organizations and left as independent so that we can trust them. Unfortunately, the opposite of that has happened during this current administration. Do you believe the United States will be able to recover its leadership position in public health? People are looking to the U.S. and saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? What\u2019s going on?\u201d But I do believe our F.D.A. will hold. I do believe our C.D.C. will hold. I do believe the institutions we have will hold over the long term. I\u2019ve traveled to many different countries and seen where they don\u2019t have good governance or good institutions, or they don\u2019t have a free press. We are lucky to have those things in the United States. And, yes, they have been eroded to some extent, some of them, and, yes, our position in global leadership has people scratching their heads. Can it be built back? Yes. Definitely. Do you believe it\u2019s appropriate for drug makers to profit from the sale of vaccines in the midst of a pandemic? I think they should make a small profit, because we want them to stay in business. And at the end of the day, they are beholden to their shareholders. The question is how much profit. And I think during a pandemic like this, it should only be slightly above the marginal cost of the vaccine. Do you accept the line of criticism that says big philanthropy has too much power right now, that individuals, not governments, are making decisions that shape educational policy and public policy? I think that\u2019s a critique that is well worth listening to and looking at. In our philanthropic work, there isn\u2019t a single thing that we don\u2019t work on in partnership with governments. Because at the end of the day, it is governments that scale things up and that can help the most people. There is a healthy ecosystem that needs to exist between government, philanthropy, the private sector and civil society. And when you get that ecosystem working at its best, no one party in that ecosystem has too much power. You know, if Bill and I had had more decision-making authority in education, maybe we would\u2019ve gotten farther in the United States. But we haven\u2019t. Some of the things that we piloted or tried got rejected, or didn\u2019t work, and I think there\u2019s a very healthy ecosystem of parents and teachers\u2019 unions and mayors and city councils that make those education decisions. I wish the U.S. school system was better for all kids. Do you believe the tax code should be changed in ways that address some of the enormous economic disparities in this country? Bill and I completely agree if you\u2019re wealthy in this country, you benefited from the system, you benefited from the amazing infrastructure of the United States, and so you have an obligation to give back. And we don\u2019t have a tax policy that is appropriately taxing the wealthiest. I\u2019m not an expert on tax policy, but I will say this: A lot of wealthy people are making a lot off of their capital gains, versus their ordinary income. And I think that\u2019s one place we ought to look at tax policy. How do you reconcile the enormous privilege that you have with the acute suffering that so many people are experiencing right now? It\u2019s something I\u2019ve pondered a lot. There\u2019s no explanation how you get to be in this situation of privilege. There\u2019s just none. But I spend a lot of my waking hours, when we\u2019re not in a pandemic, traveling and meeting other people and doing what I call letting my heart break. I\u2019ve worked in Mother Teresa\u2019s home for the dying. I\u2019ve slept on people\u2019s farms in Africa. I do meditation every morning, and I\u2019ve had days of tears thinking about people I know who\u2019ve lost a loved one. It\u2019s going to those places where your heart really hurts for everybody, not just your own sense of loss. And so I cry a lot, and then I come back and I say, \u201cHow do I take what that person shared with me and what I learned, and how do I plow that back into the work to try and make the world better, or to convince a global leader that they ought to give more money to malaria, or care about people getting a vaccine on the other side of the world, or care about a child not getting a proper education in certain cities in the United States?\u201d I just try to constantly remember that it\u2019s a privilege.",

    "first_p": "The bad news in the November jobs numbers reported Friday isn\u2019t in the rate of job creation, though that was pretty bad.",
    "article_text": "A Jobs Report Without Silver Linings The bad news in the November jobs numbers reported Friday isn\u2019t in the rate of job creation, though that was pretty bad. Employers added only 245,000 positions last month, and even if you adjust for the one-time effects of temporary census jobs being eliminated, it would take 29 more months to return to February employment levels at that rate of job creation. But at least there is good reason to expect those numbers to improve once coronavirus vaccines are widely available. The thing that is most worrying is what seems to be happening among the people who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The jobs report offers clues that what was once temporary unemployment is becoming more permanent \u2014 in ways that, if unchecked, could do long-term damage to millions of families and to the economic potential of the United States. Although the unemployment rate fell last month, to 6.7 percent from 6.9 percent, it was for the worst of reasons: Many Americans gave up even looking for work. The number of adults not in the labor force \u2014 neither working nor actively seeking work \u2014 rose by 560,000, as the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.2 percentage points. The share of prime working-age Americans working \u2014 those between 25 and 54 \u2014 was unchanged in November at 76 percent and remains far below its 80.5 percent share in February. The number of people who are not in the labor force but say they want a job is 2.2 million higher than it was in February. A growing share of the unemployed have been out of work for a long time. The number of Americans unemployed for more than 27 weeks rose by 385,000 in November. Since only September, the number of these long-term unemployed is up by a devastating 1.5 million people \u2014 a 64 percent increase. Put those numbers together, and the pattern is clear: Many people who lost jobs in the spring have been without work continuously since then, and some of them have given up looking. A central lesson of the grinding recovery that followed the 2008-9 recession is that these prolonged periods of unemployment (actively seeking a job) or nonemployment (not working, and also not looking) have long-term effects. Even as the economy recovered, people had experienced various forms of damage. Some people\u2019s skills became outdated. But more generally, many people just lost a sense of attachment to the work force. It\u2019s much harder to find a job when you\u2019ve been out of work for years than when you\u2019ve been on a short-term layoff. And that\u2019s before you get to the more social dimensions of the problem; those out of the work force can become vulnerable to developing addictions and other mental health problems. The nonemployment crisis of the 2010s and the opioid crisis of the 2010s weren\u2019t completely separate. In that episode, the share of prime-age Americans who were employed did not return to its January 2008 level until August 2019! When economists talk about what a slow, disappointing expansion that was, this is a big part of what they are referring to. There is a good chance to avoid that fate in the recovery from the pandemic recession. A quick snapback in employment after widespread vaccination is possible in 2021, and it could pull many of those long-term unemployed and nonemployed back into the work force quickly, after only a year or so of detachment from the rhythms of work life. This is normally the point in analyzing a bad jobs report where one points out silver linings \u2014 those little reasons for optimism that are hiding if you know where to look. This month, they are hard to find. The data in the new numbers are based on employment levels in the week of Nov. 8-14. Various real-time data sources point to a softening in economic activity since then, as coronavirus infections have risen and the weather has turned colder, limiting outdoor dining and retail options. December employment numbers could well be worse. For a slight hint of optimism, one of the big categories of job loss that dragged down the November numbers will probably reverse. Retailers cut about 35,000 jobs, according to the official numbers, which are adjusted for the typical seasonal patterns. But if you ignore those seasonal adjustments, the sector added 302,000 jobs \u2014 stores did do holiday hiring, just less than past experience would have predicted. The good news, such as it is, is that in January this pattern should reverse itself, creating an apparent employment surge when seasonal adjustments are applied. In a miserable November for American workers, this is what counts as a cause for optimism: The people who weren\u2019t hired as temporary help at retailers this holiday season won\u2019t lose their jobs in January. But the real hope for 2021 is that enough unemployed and nonemployed Americans can come back to work quickly enough that the long-lasting effects of the last scarring downturn can be prevented from recurring.",

    "article_text": "Pelosi voices optimism on stimulus after McConnell agrees to compromise on a year-end spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi flashed fresh optimism on Friday that the House and Senate could soon reach a bipartisan deal on an elusive pandemic stimulus plan after she and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed to try to find an agreement that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package. \u201cThat would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said at a news conference in the Capitol Friday morning, a day after her conversation with Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. The phone call marked their first conversation since the election. Though Ms. Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be \u201csufficient time\u201d to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported on Friday as an added accelerant. \u201cThere is momentum. There is momentum,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed similar resolve on Thursday, although he stopped short of endorsing the $908 billion outline proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates that Ms. Pelosi has said should be the starting point for talks, instead pressing for a far smaller bill. Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like liability protections for businesses, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11, though most involved in the process say that a resolution is feasible before the end of the year. After months of insisting they would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Democrats now appear poised to accept less than one third of the spending they initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs, leaving other priorities unaddressed until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office Jan. 20. The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks, and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine. While a bipartisan group of senators is expected to continue working on finalizing legislative text through the weekend, there remain a number of significant hurdles. The policy divides that have helped derail attempts to reach agreement earlier this year persist even as lawmakers circulate a tentative outline. Pressed on her reversal, Ms. Pelosi was defensive on Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that the Senate called nonstarters were important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Mr. Biden\u2019s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to \u201ca total game-changer.\u201d \u201cPresident-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it, as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to saves lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Pandemic Arrived. His Text Back Did Not. \u201cWant to go on a 6 ft apart walk this afternoon?\u201d I texted. No response. A week passed as I wiped down every surface of my apartment, but those three hopeful dots never appeared. I began to face the facts. I had been ghosted during quarantine. There are clear but unspoken milestones of app-mediated dating. The first is moving your virtual courtship offline. Unless you are highly unlikable, a second date is usually guaranteed. Tread slowly. Third and fourth dates are crucial. By then, you can no longer have the same conversation about siblings and work. You actually have to get to know a person. At this point, you may begin folding them into the other parts of your life. You let them meet a select group of friends whom you can count on to dress well and banter lightheartedly. You\u2019ve brought them to your hidden spots where the bartender knows your order, cooked breakfast with your roommates. You exhale. This could actually work. The thing about this timeline, though, is it doesn\u2019t account for a pandemic. [Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.] We had been seeing each other for three months, my longest relationship to date and the most comfortable. He was the first guy whose place I didn\u2019t feel the urge to flee in the morning after spending the night; instead, we would hang out and watch episode after episode of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d He was training for a marathon, and often it was only his pre-scheduled runs that would end our TV binge. I kept looking at my calendar, counting the weeks since our first date and bracing myself for the inevitable fade-out that had happened with all the other men I\u2019d seen in New York. Each day felt like a small victory \u2014 one step closer to an actual, real-world relationship. Two weeks before New York shut down, I was the fifth wheel to two sets of coupled-up friends at an Indian restaurant in the West Village. Between bites of chicken tikka masala, my friends assured me that it was time for the feelings talk. Was this a talk of exclusivity? Defining the relationship? I wasn\u2019t quite sure, but my friends insisted that there comes a point in all real relationships when feelings can no longer be left unsaid. I didn\u2019t want to be the one to initiate this talk. I wanted to carry on as the mysterious, chill girl who doesn\u2019t discuss feelings \u2014 or even have needs. But as my coupled-up friends informed me, my escalating anxiety signaled that I was not, in fact, the chill girl, and that it was time. Equipped with my friend\u2019s advice (and with several seasons of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d under my belt), I was ready. I texted the guy saying that I needed to check in \u2014 direct but vague, as instructed. \u201cLet\u2019s get lunch after my run,\u201d he wrote. He\u2019s always running! I applied waterproof mascara, put on my best high-waisted jeans and headed to my execution. We split French toast and chicken and waffles while talking about a job he didn\u2019t get; he asked no questions about mine. He glanced at his Apple watch several times. We settled the check and headed to the park across the street. I didn\u2019t know it then, but it was a day of lasts. Last time dining out, last time sitting in a crowded park, last shared meal. After several moments of silence punctuated by my offhand remarks about dog breeds, I told him about my feelings. We had spent an intense weekend together, after which he hadn\u2019t contacted me for days, so I wanted to know where he was \u201cat.\u201d If I had feelings, I wanted to know if he did too. What I got in return was confusing. Or maybe just upsetting. He told me he liked me but that he didn\u2019t want to emotionally support someone or have someone emotionally support him. He valued his independence and boundaries and running. He had space for me once a week. I held it together. We kissed goodbye. Then I met my best friend on the steps outside the Brooklyn Public Library and cried. The next day he texted, asking about a play I had seen. I told him I needed space, that we should \u201ccheck in next week.\u201d Unknown to me, this was the week that New York City would ask us all for space by instituting social distancing policy. I would get my solitude whether I had asked for it or not. The world would look a lot different during the pandemic. And yet my primary preoccupations remained the same. Like many New Yorkers, I experienced dread while reading daily headlines. I approached each morning anxiously, recognizing that the gravity of this crisis would continue to unfold. But the thoughts that kept me up at 2 a.m. remained as self-centered as they were before Covid-19: I\u2019m lonely. I\u2019m unlovable. What if I\u2019m alone forever? As the crisis accelerated, so did the panic for intimacy. There was no time to search for someone more right. You had to grab the best available thing. I wanted to stockpile romantic partners like toilet paper. The store was out of Charmin, so I frantically grabbed the 99-cent Scott. The runner and I started texting again. And then he ghosted me. Lockdown was a turning point for many people in the early dating stages. As conventional wisdom was screaming at the time: If you\u2019re a couple, be a couple. Quarantine together, or break up. We broke up. I watched with jealousy as several friends overcame the hurdle I couldn\u2019t. My roommate, also in a budding three-month relationship, bought walkie-talkies to communicate with her new suitor. It was nauseatingly cute. If others could do it, why couldn\u2019t I? In isolation, I spiraled into hypotheticals. If I could have kept up the myth of chill girl for a little longer, would we still be together, sharing a bed, shielding each other from the misery outside? In quarantine you lose the excuse of life\u2019s many distractions. There is no \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t see that text,\u201d or \u201cMaybe he\u2019s busy at work or out with friends.\u201d You must remind yourself of the truth: that he\u2019s sitting on his couch, looking at his phone, choosing to not respond. You\u2019re also drastically limited in terms of diversions, making the sting of rejection all the more painful. There is no bartender to flirt with, no movie theater to hide in, no live music to drown out your manic thoughts. It is a harsh but clarifying reality. Our need for connection and reciprocity loom larger in times of crisis. The world spins off its axis and we turn to those around us to keep from spiraling out along with it. But even as social distancing presents challenges, the opportunities to support those we care for are vast. They just take new forms: 2 a.m. phone calls to your friend across the coast, shared playlists, House Party happy hours. These moments of mutual connection offer the grounding we need. We feel that we are being held, even when no one is physically there to do the holding. His ghosting confirmed my fears that this relationship, by contrast, could bear no weight. I was forced to confront my own needs. I was missing something larger than this one person, whom I had yet to really get to know. The aching was not just rejection but the disappointment of thinking someone might provide what I was so desperately seeking in all relationships: reciprocity, emotional matching, assurance. Love during quarantine is no different from love during any other time. Instagram feeds signal an uptick in friends\u2019 engagements, but quarantine does not make love out of thin air, nor does it break a relationship that was already off its hinges. It simply sheds light. Jenna Klorfein is a social worker in New York City. Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.

    "article_text": "Could a Blood Test Show if a Covid-19 Vaccine Works? A new study in monkeys suggests that a blood test could predict the effectiveness of a Covid-19 vaccine \u2014\u00a0and perhaps speed up the clinical trials needed to get a working vaccine to billions of people around the world. The study, published on Friday in Nature, reveals telltale blood markers that predict whether a monkey\u2019s immune system is prepared to wipe out incoming coronaviruses. The finding raises hope that researchers will be able to look for the same markers in people who get vaccines in clinical trials. If the markers are strong enough, they could reveal if the vaccines protect against Covid-19. And researchers would no longer have to wait for some trial volunteers to get the disease, as they do now. \u201cIt will pave the way for a much more rapid advancement of the Covid vaccine field,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and one of the researchers behind the new study. Last month brought the stunning news that clinical trials of two new coronavirus vaccines, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech, showed efficacy rates around 95 percent. The strength of these two vaccines is, paradoxically, bad news for the dozens of others in earlier stages of development. Many of them will most likely have to be compared against the robust front-runners rather than a placebo shot. Because that is a high statistical bar to clear, their trials will need a lot more volunteers, time and money. \u201cYou\u2019d have to follow millions of people for a long time,\u201d said Dr. Nelson Michael, the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where a protein-based vaccine is being prepared for clinical trials in early 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s just fantasy.\u201d For some smaller companies, these comparison trials may be deal-breakers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of dropout,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic. That\u2019s a big problem, because Pfizer and Moderna won\u2019t have nearly enough doses to give to everyone in the United States, let alone the world. And the next wave of vaccines may turn out to be superior to the first, in one way or the other. They could cost a lot less, for example. Some might come in just one dose instead of two, and won\u2019t need a deep freeze. Some might offer protection that lasts a lot longer. \u201cWe\u2019d rather not have to revaccinate the world every one or two years,\u201d Dr. Michael said. The new monkey study offers a ray of hope for these next-generation vaccines, suggesting that they could be tested not against older vaccines, but using a measurement known as a \u201ccorrelate of protection.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the holy grail of vaccine research,\u201d Dr. Michael said. Influenza vaccines are already tested this way. Every new flu season requires the design of a new flu shot, but researchers don\u2019t have to run clinical trials comparing it with old versions. Instead, they just check whether the new vaccine triggers a person\u2019s immune system to make enough of a certain kind of antibody against the flu. If it does, then researchers know the vaccine is adequately stimulating the immune system. If scientists could discover a correlate of protection against the coronavirus, they could follow the example of the flu. \u201cThat is an entirely plausible and feasible scenario,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said that basing clinical trials on correlates of protection \u2014\u00a0if they turn out to exist \u2014\u00a0\u201cpossibly could be considered in the future.\u201d A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. In their new study, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues found a correlate of protection in monkeys. They built the experiment on their previous research showing that once monkeys recover from Covid-19, they can resist a second infection. The scientists drew blood from these exposed animals and isolated an array of protective antibodies called IgG. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The researchers set out to see if there was a level of IgG that reliably protected monkeys from Covid-19. If the IgG antibodies produced by vaccines were above that level, the vaccines could be judged effective. To find that line, the researchers gave monkeys varying doses of antibodies, and then exposed them all to the coronavirus and watched how well they fought off the infection. In the monkeys with the weakest dose, the viruses multiplied much as they would in an ordinary animal. But the monkeys that got a medium dose produced far fewer viruses. Some of them were able to wipe out the viruses altogether. At the highest dose, the monkeys were completely protected. Until now, scientists relied on circumstantial evidence that suggested IgG antibodies were crucial to clearing coronavirus infections. The new study puts that idea to the test \u2014\u00a0and determines the threshold of IgG antibodies required to ward off an infection. \u201cThis is the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that we\u2019ve actually proven that antibodies protect,\u201d Dr. Barouch said. \u201cEverything else has been a statistical association.\u201d The experiment revealed that a modest amount of IgG antibodies turned out to be enough. That could be heartening news for vaccine developers, because even so-so vaccines may be able to cross the threshold. Researchers are now starting to review the results of vaccine clinical trials to see if a correlate of protection like the one identified by Dr. Barouch and his colleagues in monkeys exists in people. \u201cThe study bodes well for the upcoming immune correlates studies,\u201d said Holly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute in Seattle who was not involved in Dr. Barouch\u2019s study. Although it will take some time for those studies to produce solid results, Dr. Janes said preliminary hints made her optimistic. \u201cThe emerging data do suggest that we could be gleefully surprised,\u201d she said.

Se ci\u00f1e a su cuerpo cuando se desplaza por el escenario, moviendo los labios al comp\u00e1s de canciones de amor en espa\u00f1ol en un lugar lleno sobre todo de ausencia. Es tarde el 9 de marzo, y Yimel Alvarado est\u00e1 en su trabajo habitual de los lunes, un bar encima de un restaurante mexicano en la secci\u00f3n Corona de Queens. Aqu\u00ed es donde se siente como en casa, donde por lo general un p\u00fablico de clientes gays y transexuales aplaude sus bromas coquetas. \u00a1Tomen!, dice a menudo, mientras los fans tiran dinero a sus pies. La noche se nos va a ir. Pero esta noche Yimel no es ella misma. Lleva d\u00edas as\u00ed. Su delineado de ojos estilo Cleopatra solo acent\u00faa el cansancio de su mirada. Es solo una gripa, dice. En alg\u00fan momento, la due\u00f1a del bar, preocupada, saca el tequila. Las dos amigas se toman unos tragos mientras, cerca, unos cuantos clientes se besan y se juntan para hacerse selfis con el celular. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la puerta del restaurante, la misma negaci\u00f3n y temor se ciernen sobre los barrios densamente poblados, en los apartamentos subdivididos por paredes de yeso y necesidad, a lo largo y ancho del bullicio de la Avenida Roosevelt. En un edificio, una inmigrante de Ecuador se preocupa por los muchos parientes que viven en su estrecho apartamento, entre ellos sus fr\u00e1giles padres. Un integrante de la familia, su cu\u00f1ado, tiene una tos persistente. En otro, una pareja de Banglad\u00e9s recibe una llamada de su hija desde su dormitorio en una prestigiosa universidad de la Ivy League, quien les advierte que se arriesgan a enfermarse al ir al trabajo y compartir el aire de cerca con extra\u00f1os: su madre en el aeropuerto de La Guardia, su padre en su taxi amarillo. Ella les ruega que se queden en casa. No lo hacen. Pero un conductor de Uber est\u00e1 tan obsesionado con la tos de dos pasajeros recientes que ha dejado de buscar clientes. Hace 30 a\u00f1os en Nepal, huy\u00f3 de su vida de monje budista al tirar su t\u00fanica roja bajo un \u00e1rbol. Ahora reza mientras desinfecta su Toyota negro. A la vuelta de la esquina, un chef tailand\u00e9s que viaja en metro a Manhattan env\u00eda angustiados mensajes de texto desde el trabajo a su compa\u00f1ero, menos preocupado, en casa. Le inquieta el creciente n\u00famero de casos confirmados en Estados Unidos. \u00bfEst\u00e1 aqu\u00ed? \u00bfEl mortal coronavirus? En el Hospital Elmhurst, cerca de ah\u00ed, una m\u00e9dico de urgencias ha notado una oleada de pacientes con s\u00edntomas parecidos a los de la gripe. Ahora hay confirmaci\u00f3n de lo que ella y sus colegas sab\u00edan que era inevitable: el primer caso de COVID-19, la enfermedad mortal causada por el coronavirus. Est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed. Pero los mensajes son contradictorios. El gobernador Andrew M. Cuomo ha declarado el estado de emergencia, mientras que el presidente Donald Trump sigue restando importancia al virus. Una \u201czona de contenci\u00f3n\u201d est\u00e1 a punto de establecerse en la peque\u00f1a ciudad de Nueva Rochelle, mientras que a una decena de kil\u00f3metros al sur el ajetreo apresurado de Manhattan fluye ininterrumpidamente. Pronto, este punto del mapa de Queens, donde convergen tantas culturas, se convertir\u00e1 en el epicentro mundial de un tipo de crisis de salud que no se ha visto en Estados Unidos en un siglo. Muy pronto. Por ahora, cansada, Yimel Alvarado contin\u00faa su espect\u00e1culo, animada por poco m\u00e1s que la dosis de tequila. Decidida pero enferma, vocaliza una balada en la que una mujer se dirige a la esposa de su amante. Ahora es tarde, se\u00f1ora Ahora es tarde, se\u00f1ora Es demasiado tarde ahora, se\u00f1ora. Son apenas unos tres kil\u00f3metros los que separan las estaciones de las calles 69 y 103 de la l\u00ednea 7 del metro en el norte de Queens. Sin embargo, bajo las v\u00edas elevadas se extiende el mundo entero.

Luego las viviendas para las masas, los rostros siempre cambiantes. Caminar por la Avenida Roosevelt ahora es viajar desde los picos del Himalaya a las \u00e1ridas llanuras mexicanas y escuchar la m\u00fasica de la mezcla de lenguas y dialectos, todo ello en un radio de tres decenas de breves cuadras. En el crep\u00fasculo perpetuo que proyectan desde el cielo las v\u00edas elevadas del metro, los comerciantes venden cestas tejidas de Ecuador y zapatos de cuero de M\u00e9xico, mientras que tenderos indios exhiben sus productos y hombres llevan cabras desolladas a las carnicer\u00edas halal. Los dentistas y los m\u00e9dicos ofrecen sus servicios desde estrechos escaparates, al igual que los autoproclamados curanderos que se encuentran entre las estatuas y velas de las tiendas de art\u00edculos religiosos, disponibles para consultas. Los animados ritmos de la calle siguen el ritmo percusivo de la cumbia, el golpe del reguet\u00f3n, la llamada a la oraci\u00f3n. El combustible de todo esto es un buffet internacional de chisporroteantes tacos de carne del sur de M\u00e9xico, bollos al vapor de Nepal, curris indios, ceviche peruano, bu\u00f1uelos colombianos. Y en todas partes, gente. Muchos trabajan en los servicios que animan la ciudad: conducen, limpian, cocinan, construyen. Se despiertan con la primera luz del d\u00eda y se alinean en los andenes del metro, cascos y vasos de caf\u00e9 en la mano. Muchos desconf\u00edan de las autoridades, o son vulnerables a la explotaci\u00f3n, o simplemente tienen demasiado miedo de reportarse enfermos. Decenas de miles brotan de los conventillos de ladrillo con patios estrechos, de las peque\u00f1as casas con jardines de parra, de los s\u00f3tanos con poca luz natural. Si tienen suerte, viven con familia o amigos; si no, viven entre extra\u00f1os, pagan una cama o tal vez solo un sof\u00e1. Condiciones imperfectas para el distanciamiento social. Perfectas para el contagio. \u2014 Andrew M. Cuomo, gobernador de New York Yimel Alvarado yace enferma en la penumbra de su peque\u00f1o dormitorio; sobre su cabeza, en la pared, hay un crucifijo. Las cortinas de sat\u00e9n rosa est\u00e1n corridas contra la luz de la tarde, cinco d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de su actuaci\u00f3n de cabaret en el bar arriba del restaurante El Tr\u00edo. Desde entonces, un p\u00e1nico de baja intensidad se ha instalado en la ciudad afuera de su modesto apartamento de Jackson Heights. Los torniquetes del metro son desinfectados dos veces al d\u00eda. La Di\u00f3cesis de Brooklyn ha suspendido la obligaci\u00f3n de la misa dominical para los cat\u00f3licos. El Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Nueva York ha alertado a sus 77 distritos que la COVID-19 est\u00e1 ahora clasificada como una pandemia. El capit\u00e1n Jonathan Cermeli, el oficial al mando de la comisar\u00eda 110 de Elmhurst, no puede creer el cambio abrupto de los acontecimientos. Hace solo una semana, en la fiesta de cumplea\u00f1os por los 12 a\u00f1os de su hijo, unos amigos discut\u00edan un tema que parec\u00eda totalmente ajeno a sus vidas. \u00bfHan o\u00eddo sobre ese virus? Ahora el alcalde Bill de Blasio ha declarado el estado de emergencia. Su oficina dir\u00e1 que estuvo en contacto frecuente con los hospitales de la ciudad e inform\u00f3 regularmente a los funcionarios electos y al p\u00fablico. Pero dos concejales locales, Francisco Moya y Daniel Dromm, se quejan de recibir poca orientaci\u00f3n por parte de la alcald\u00eda. \u201cNos sentimos como si estuvi\u00e9ramos solos\u201d, dir\u00e1 m\u00e1s tarde Moya. Yimel, de 40 a\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 sola. Como tantos inmigrantes indocumentados, no tiene seguro m\u00e9dico, ni m\u00e9dico de cabecera al que llamar. Ha rechazado varias veces los ofrecimientos de ayuda de sus compa\u00f1eros de habitaci\u00f3n \u2014que la ven como a una madre\u2014 y apenas ha insinuado a su familia en M\u00e9xico que est\u00e1 enferma. Ha recurrido a la oraci\u00f3n y al t\u00e9 con infusi\u00f3n de c\u00edtricos para tratar lo que llama sarc\u00e1sticamente su bendita tos. Pero ahora la mujer siempre dispuesta a tomarse un selfi coqueto no contesta el tel\u00e9fono, y su texto sobre una tos ha asustado en el Bronx a una de sus hermanas menores, Olivia Aldama, que intuye lo que esto significa: su amada Chiquis est\u00e1 enferma. Olivia, de 34 a\u00f1os, termina su turno en una tintorer\u00eda y se apresura para tomar el metro a Jackson Heights. Entra en la oscura habitaci\u00f3n de Yimel y encuentra a su hermana gimiendo en sue\u00f1os, con el celular enterrado entre las s\u00e1banas. Su respiraci\u00f3n es trabajosa, sus labios est\u00e1n secos, su lengua parece papel blanco; necesita ir al hospital. Estoy aqu\u00ed, dice Olivia, abraz\u00e1ndola. Ya estoy aqu\u00ed. Puede que Olivia no sepa todo sobre la hermana que tiene en sus brazos. Que Yimel durmi\u00f3 en las calles cuando lleg\u00f3 a Nueva York hace unos 20 a\u00f1os. Que fue trabajadora sexual, y soport\u00f3 ataques verbales y f\u00edsicos bajo las v\u00edas elevadas de Jackson Heights. Que puede que a\u00fan lo sea. Lo que Olivia sabe es que, al nacer, su hermana fue identificada como un ni\u00f1o, un g\u00e9nero con el que Yimel se dio cuenta m\u00e1s tarde que no encajaba, pero que ella y su familia a\u00fan reconocen como parte de su pasado. Al crecer en Tlapa de Comonfort, una ciudad en las monta\u00f1as del sur de M\u00e9xico, en el estado de Guerrero, prefer\u00eda jugar a ponerse vestidos con las cuatro hijas de la familia, lo que provocaba la ira de su padre. Las tensiones se fueron acumulando a lo largo de los a\u00f1os hasta que un d\u00eda, rebosante de bebida y verg\u00fcenza, el hombre sac\u00f3 un cuchillo y grit\u00f3: \u00a1M\u00e1tese! La \u00fanica opci\u00f3n era huir. Pero antes de que unos contrabandistas la cruzaran al otro lado de la frontera, la adolescente acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a su madre en el fresco de la Bas\u00edlica de Guadalupe en Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. All\u00ed, la madre la encomend\u00f3 a la Virgen. En Jackson Heights, la nueva inmigrante al fin encontr\u00f3 aceptaci\u00f3n entre las personas gays y transexuales que tambi\u00e9n hab\u00edan huido de la intolerancia en Am\u00e9rica Latina. Floreci\u00f3 en Yimel Alvarado y encontr\u00f3 su vocaci\u00f3n de artista en los clubes gays de la Avenida Roosevelt. Tambi\u00e9n se ha convertido en la atrevida matriarca de gran coraz\u00f3n de lo que se conoce como la Familia Alvarado, un grupo muy unido a cuyos integrantes ha alimentado, vestido, aconsejado y a menudo acogido. Sobre la puerta de su apartamento cuelga un cartel que reafirma, en ingl\u00e9s: We Are So Good Together, Somos tan buenos juntos. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, sin embargo, Yimel ha salido menos, ha ganado peso y ha bebido m\u00e1s. A menudo se queda aqu\u00ed en su dormitorio, creando su glamuroso vestuario en una m\u00e1quina de coser, o dibujando dise\u00f1os de vestidos en un cuaderno. Tambi\u00e9n anota los aforismos reconfortantes que encuentra. Antes de rendirte, intenta Antes de morir, VIVE Ahora, que Olivia lucha por ayudar a su hermana a sentarse, un joven salvadore\u00f1o llama a la puerta. Desde que Yimel se enter\u00f3 de que al chico le hab\u00edan robado en un refugio para personas sin hogar, \u00e9l ha estado viviendo en el apartamento y duerme en el sof\u00e1. Juntos, visten y gu\u00edan a Yimel, que delira, hacia las escaleras. Ella se incorpora y comienza a bajar los escalones con calma, uno por uno, solo para detenerse, exhausta. Llaman un taxi. Pero el conductor, al sospechar que la mujer desplomada en las escaleras tiene el virus, se disculpa y se va. En un fugaz momento de claridad, Yimel habla: Llama a una ambulancia. La ambulancia que lleva otro posible caso de covid llega a la entrada de emergencias del Hospital Elmhurst. El coloso de color salm\u00f3n remonta sus ra\u00edces a casi dos siglos atr\u00e1s, a un hospital penitenciario en lo que ahora se llama Roosevelt Island, donde se atend\u00eda a los encarcelados, los pobres y los desamparados mucho antes de que se abriera este complejo de once pisos en 1957. Puede que otros vean aqu\u00ed un deslucido hospital municipal sin comodidades que atiende sobre todo a los desfavorecidos y a los que no tienen seguro. Pero la doctora Laura Iavicoli, de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, considera que su hospital de protecci\u00f3n social es \u201cel lugar m\u00e1s m\u00e1gico de la Tierra\u201d, con personal capacitado y comprometido y una mezcla diversa de pacientes que cada d\u00eda presentan nuevos desaf\u00edos. Pero nunca un desaf\u00edo tan abrumador como este virus mortal, que apareci\u00f3 por primera vez a finales del a\u00f1o pasado en la ciudad china de Wuhan, a 12.000 kil\u00f3metros de Nueva York. Ahora es aqu\u00ed en Queens, donde la reciente confirmaci\u00f3n de casos de coronavirus en el hospital predice sombr\u00edos d\u00edas por venir. Al principio el hospital se consider\u00f3 preparado: al realizar un ejercicio interactivo sobre el virus con el personal a finales de enero, una serie de simulacros de rutina y asegurar el acceso a cuatro salas de aislamiento con presi\u00f3n negativa en el departamento de emergencias. Los responsables supusieron que el virus se comportar\u00eda como otras enfermedades contagiosas para las que el hospital se hab\u00eda preparado pero que jam\u00e1s hab\u00eda visto, como el \u00e9bola. Pero las previsiones se derrumbaron. Las enfermedades parecidas a la gripe est\u00e1n fuera de control, mientras que los casos de coronavirus van en aumento. Y como el acceso a las pruebas est\u00e1 severamente limitado, los m\u00e9dicos env\u00edan a muchos pacientes \u2014incluyendo a algunos que pueden tener covid\u2014 a casa para que se a\u00edslen. Los administradores del hospital est\u00e1n investigando la pandemia de gripe de 1918, se comunican con expertos m\u00e9dicos de todo el mundo y se re\u00fanen todas las noches en una sala de conferencias para revisar los modelos y las estad\u00edsticas. Pero Iavicoli se ha convencido de que este virus no puede esquivarse. El plan inicial de aislamiento del hospital \u2014basado en los protocolos de varios pa\u00edses y agencias, incluyendo los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades\u2014 descansaba en otra suposici\u00f3n m\u00e1s: que el coronavirus se manifiesta con fiebre, tos y dificultad respiratoria. Ahora los m\u00e9dicos se est\u00e1n dando cuenta de que la diarrea y el malestar tambi\u00e9n pueden indicar covid, lo que significa que, sin querer, algunos pacientes contagiosos pueden haber sido pasados por alto. Cada d\u00eda, m\u00e1s espacio de los departamentos de emergencia debe ser reutilizado como zona de aislamiento. El \u00e1rea reservada para el tratamiento de la tos y los cortes menores es ahora para la covid. El \u00e1rea de cuidados intensivos, originalmente con siete camas, pronto tendr\u00e1 20, todas para la covid. Las mangueras verdes de ox\u00edgeno serpentean por el suelo, mientras las mangueras azules de los filtros de aire se elevan hasta el techo. Los enfermos se agrupan en la entrada, se encorvan en sillas, se acuestan en camillas a lo largo de las paredes de color rosa apagado. Ahora los param\u00e9dicos en trajes protectores traen a una m\u00e1s: Yimel Alvarado. La colocan en una camilla en el pasillo, junto a una joven que sujeta su barriga y grita en agon\u00eda. Brevemente fuera de su delirio, Yimel la mira con evidente compasi\u00f3n, pero pronto se pierde de nuevo, y habla en el idioma de la alucinaci\u00f3n al mirar fijamente los monitores del hospital en el pasillo: Por eso no veo televisi\u00f3n. Porque nom\u00e1s cambian de canal. Sin el ox\u00edgeno que recib\u00eda en la ambulancia, Yimel se debilita. Un sorbo de agua le causa accesos de tos, lo que env\u00eda a Olivia a buscar ayuda. Un enfermero se apresura a comprobar la oxigenaci\u00f3n de la sangre de Yimel. Varios trabajadores del hospital se re\u00fanen pronto alrededor de ella. Primero en ingl\u00e9s, luego en espa\u00f1ol, preguntan: \u00bfHas viajado? \u00bfHas tenido tos? \u00bfHas tenido fiebre alta? \u00bfPor cu\u00e1nto tiempo? Olivia repite las respuestas que escuch\u00f3 que su hermana dio a los param\u00e9dicos en la ambulancia: No. S\u00ed. S\u00ed. Cuatro d\u00edas. A Yimel la llevan detr\u00e1s de un conjunto de puertas de cristal. Horas m\u00e1s tarde, un doctor aparece para informar a Olivia que su hermana se encuentra en estado cr\u00edtico con neumon\u00eda y que estar\u00eda muerta si no la hubieran llevado al hospital. Hace cinco d\u00edas, Yimel actuaba en un bar; ahora est\u00e1 en cuidados intensivos. Por la ma\u00f1ana estar\u00e1 inconsciente, intubada y encerrada en una tienda de pl\u00e1stico. A principios de este s\u00e1bado, Trump afirm\u00f3 que el n\u00famero relativamente bajo de muertes relacionadas con el coronavirus en el pa\u00eds \u2014unas 50 hasta ahora\u2014, se deb\u00eda a \u201cun mont\u00f3n de buenas decisiones\u201d. Ma\u00f1ana describir\u00e1 el virus como \u201calgo sobre lo que tenemos un tremendo control\u201d. Pero estas optimistas afirmaciones contradicen lo que se est\u00e1 viviendo en el Hospital Elmhurst, donde los casos de covid y enfermedades similares a la gripe contin\u00faan su siniestro aumento. Cerca de la medianoche, Iavicoli habla por tel\u00e9fono con otros dos supervisores de la sala de urgencias, Stuart Kessler y Phillip Fairweather, para evaluar el da\u00f1o de otro d\u00eda desgarrador. Iavicoli, que tiene experiencia en el manejo de urgencias, recomienda un requerimiento estricto de que el personal de los departamentos de emergencias use equipo de protecci\u00f3n personal completo \u2014bata, guantes, gafas y m\u00e1scara N95\u2014 en todo momento. Los tres doctores est\u00e1n de acuerdo. Ahora todo el departamento es oficialmente una \u201czona de riesgo\u201d, basado en una nueva suposici\u00f3n: es probable que todos tengan covid. \u2014 El presidente donald Trump Una quietud se asienta sobre la ciudad. Se han cancelado los eventos con los que Nueva York mide el tiempo, como el Desfile del D\u00eda de San Patricio. Las escuelas est\u00e1n cerradas para m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de estudiantes. Se suspenden los servicios religiosos. Los centros de transporte est\u00e1n desiertos. Los rascacielos est\u00e1n vac\u00edos. Broadway est\u00e1 en penumbra. Atravesar ese silencio despierta una ansiedad palpable, una preparaci\u00f3n colectiva para el golpe que viene. En el apartamento de arriba de una casa para dos familias en Woodside, Dawa Sherpa, el conductor nepal\u00ed de Uber, trata de limpiar lo que no puede ver pero teme que est\u00e9 presente. Limpia la escalera, donde los zapatos de sus tres hijos, de 18, 13 y 6 a\u00f1os, forman una fila ordenada en los escalones. Limpia los dormitorios, la cocina y la sala, donde hay un mapa roto del sistema de metro y un gran santuario budista con tres figuras clave: Buda Shakyamuni, Guru Rinpoche y Chenrezig. En el altar se encuentran siete cuencos de plata que se llenan de agua por la ma\u00f1ana y se vac\u00edan por la noche, un c\u00e1liz de plata rebosante de una ofrenda de t\u00e9 de color \u00e1mbar, y una gran botella de desinfectante de manos. Dawa tiene 50 a\u00f1os, es bajo y fornido, su pelo negro salpicado de gris. Naci\u00f3 en una peque\u00f1\u00edsima aldea agr\u00edcola en la cima de una monta\u00f1a en el Himalaya, se mud\u00f3 con su familia a Katmand\u00fa, y a la edad de 10 a\u00f1os fue enviado a un monasterio budista, donde su vida se convirti\u00f3 en un campo de entrenamiento espiritual de oraci\u00f3n, tareas y estudio. El no saber la lecci\u00f3n pod\u00eda resultar en una paliza. Cuando ten\u00eda unos 20 a\u00f1os, salt\u00f3 el muro de un monasterio para ver qu\u00e9 pasaba en el mundo. Jam\u00e1s volvi\u00f3. El exmonje viaj\u00f3 a China para ayudar al negocio de importaci\u00f3n de su padre, luego a Jap\u00f3n, donde trabaj\u00f3 en una f\u00e1brica de Toyota, y despu\u00e9s, en 1996, a Estados Unidos, que \u00e9l cre\u00eda que era\u201cun pa\u00eds de libertad\u201d. Gravit\u00f3 hacia Jackson Heights, se cas\u00f3 con Sita Rai, una mujer que hab\u00eda conocido en una boda en Katmand\u00fa, y comenz\u00f3 a armar un cl\u00e1sico curr\u00edculum de inmigrante: empleado en una tienda de art\u00edculos escolares; cocinero en un restaurante chino; conductor de una empresa productora; repartidor de Domino\u2019s Pizza; taxista con un turno nocturno de 12 horas. Hace cuatro a\u00f1os, Dawa pas\u00f3 a conducir para Uber, y lleva a los clientes por la zona triestatal en su camioneta Toyota negra. En las \u00faltimas semanas, ha escuchado constantemente las noticias de la emisora de radio 1010 WINS en su carro para obtener informaci\u00f3n actualizada sobre el avance de la pandemia. Entonces, hace dos semanas, dos clientes tosieron en su asiento trasero. Condujo a casa y limpi\u00f3 sistem\u00e1ticamente los asientos, las manijas de las puertas, todo, con nubes de Lysol en aerosol. No ha conducido para Uber desde entonces. Y puede que su mente le juegue una mala pasada, pero Dawa no se siente al 100 por ciento. A menos de un kil\u00f3metro de distancia, decenas de familias se re\u00fanen en un tramo comercial a lo largo de la calle 73, a pocos pasos de la Avenida Roosevelt. Esta es la secci\u00f3n de la Peque\u00f1a Banglad\u00e9s de Jackson Heights, una mezcla de tiendas de comestibles, restaurantes y tiendas que atienden a los inmigrantes de Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet. Por ahora han quedado atr\u00e1s los d\u00edas en que los hombres discut\u00edan las noticias en bengal\u00ed mientras com\u00edan samosas y beb\u00edan t\u00e9, mientras que las mujeres miraban los saris en las boutiques y los ni\u00f1os tomaban dif\u00edciles decisiones en las tiendas de dulces. Se ha ido el aire tranquilo con olor a especias. En cambio, la inquietud se ha instalado, mientras la gente se re\u00fane en una b\u00fasqueda decidida de alimentos y provisiones. Con las escuelas cerradas, los ni\u00f1os se quedar\u00e1n en casa y tomar\u00e1n clases en l\u00ednea por qui\u00e9n sabe cu\u00e1nto tiempo. As\u00ed que las madres amontonan bolsas de arroz y latas de aceite en los autom\u00f3viles familiares al tiempo que los padres llevan los trozos de carne para guardarlos en los congeladores reci\u00e9n comprados, como si estuvieran almacenando para un largo asedio. Por todas partes, la gente se enferma. Un sargento que analiza las estad\u00edsticas de cr\u00edmenes para el capit\u00e1n Cermeli en la comisar\u00eda 110. Un joyero que ayuda a dirigir una liga de f\u00fatbol en Corona. El sacerdote de la Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica San Bartolom\u00e9 en Elmhurst. A lo largo y a la redonda de la calle 73, las filas serpentean fuera de las tiendas de comestibles, y algunos estantes de las farmacias han sido vaciados. La misma escena se desarrolla en otras \u00e1reas cercanas: Peque\u00f1a India, Peque\u00f1a Colombia, Peque\u00f1a Manila. La gente que ha conocido conflictos lejanos se est\u00e1 armando para la guerra. \u2014 Bill de Blasio, alcalde de Nueva York En un edificio de ladrillos en Corona, once integrantes de una familia extensa de Ecuador, j\u00f3venes y viejos, viven en un apartamento de tres habitaciones. Dos est\u00e1n enfermos: Rosa Lema, de 41 a\u00f1os, con fiebre, y su cu\u00f1ado, con una tos violenta. Ahora, a \u00faltima hora de la tarde \u2014en un d\u00eda en que Cuomo anuncia el cierre de gran parte del estado\u2014 Rosa escucha por tel\u00e9fono de que su madre, Vicenta Flores, se ha desmayado durante una sesi\u00f3n de di\u00e1lisis en el Hospital Elmhurst, y que alguien de la familia tiene que llevarla a la sala de emergencias. Rosa, una mujer menuda con p\u00f3mulos altos y pelo oscuro y brillante, pas\u00f3 d\u00edas en la desinfecci\u00f3n de la cocina y el ba\u00f1o, muy frecuentado, que tiene una manija en la ducha para que sus padres se sostengan. Anim\u00f3 a su madre, de 77 a\u00f1os, a quedarse en su min\u00fascula habitaci\u00f3n entre las citas de di\u00e1lisis, y le compr\u00f3 Robitussin sin az\u00facar para diab\u00e9ticos para tratar lo que pensaba que era un peque\u00f1o resfriado. Estas precauciones fueron in\u00fatiles. Rosa llama a su hermano Jorge, que vive cerca. \u00c9l se apresura a ir al hospital. El plan nunca fue meter a tanta gente en el apartamento de Rosa. Ni llenar de ropa las estanter\u00edas de la sala. Ni amontonar botas polvorientas y zapatos infantiles brillantes afuera de la puerta de entrada. Pero hace unos meses, en la puerta de Rosa apareci\u00f3 su hermana Carmen con su familia, cubiertos con mantas de la Cruz Roja despu\u00e9s de que perdieron su hogar en un incendio. As\u00ed que ahora seis adultos, cinco ni\u00f1os, dos gatos y un perro viven amontonados, entre las chucher\u00edas desechadas que Vicenta ha juntado mientras recoge latas que intercambia por dinero que env\u00eda a su madre en Ecuador. Jorge vuelve a llamar, preocupado; una fila de m\u00e1s de 100 personas se despliega de la sala de emergencias. Rosa le dice que avise al personal del hospital que su madre est\u00e1 en una silla de ruedas, enferma y deca\u00edda. Pronto el hermano de Rosa vuelve a llamar, esta vez con un m\u00e9dico que tiene preguntas. \u00bfVicenta ha tenido fiebre? \u00bfAlguien m\u00e1s de la familia ha estado enfermo? S\u00ed. Tanto Rosa como su madre no se han sentido bien. Pero si su madre ha contra\u00eddo el virus, Rosa se pregunta d\u00f3nde. \u00bfEn la cl\u00ednica de di\u00e1lisis? \u00bfDurante las visitas a otro hospital de Queens donde su marido de 83 a\u00f1os, Jos\u00e9 Redentor Lema \u2014el padre de Rosa\u2014 se hab\u00eda estado recuperando de complicaciones de una cirug\u00eda de p\u00e1ncreas? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 hay de la sala, donde Vicenta se sienta durante el d\u00eda, jugando con los gatos o acariciando las colitas de caballo de sus nietas? Por la noche los sof\u00e1s se convierten en camas para la hermana de Rosa, su marido y sus gemelos; \u00e9l es un azulejero que se enferm\u00f3 cuando el virus caus\u00f3 estragos entre su cuadrilla de construcci\u00f3n. En Elmhurst, los trabajadores del hospital ponen a su madre sobre una camilla y se la llevan, mientras que Jorge se queda a apreciar el largo camino de los enfermos y los preocupados, algunos tan agotados que est\u00e1n tirados en el suelo. Rosa piensa en la fortaleza de su madre. Cocinando tortillas de ma\u00edz sobre el fuego para la familia en su pueblo natal, Bibli\u00e1n. Criando seis hijos mientras su marido viajaba por el pa\u00eds construyendo carreteras. Luego, cuando sus hijos emigraron a Estados Unidos, criando a algunos de sus nietos. Una vez que estuvo en Queens, la menuda mujer, de menos de un metro y medio de altura, aprendi\u00f3 a moverse por las calles de la gran ciudad mientras recog\u00eda latas. Incluso sali\u00f3 de un coma de seis semanas despu\u00e9s de que un carro la atropell\u00f3. Ella va a estar bien. Esto es lo que Rosa les dir\u00e1 a sus hermanos. Estar\u00e1 bien. Pero, \u00bfqu\u00e9 le dir\u00e1 a su padre, que ha sido trasladado recientemente a un centro de rehabilitaci\u00f3n? Est\u00e1 tan apegado a su esposa de 52 a\u00f1os que siempre pregunta lo mismo si ella llega un minuto tarde a casa. \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la Vicenta? \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la Vicenta? \u2014 Dave A. Chokshi, jefe de salud poblacional del sistema de hospitales p\u00fablicos de Nueva York A dos kil\u00f3metros de distancia en Woodside, en otro edificio de ladrillos, Jack Wongserat, el chef, le ha hablado de sus temores sobre el coronavirus a su compa\u00f1ero, Joe Farris, que no ha estado tan ansioso. Hasta ahora. Jack tiene una fiebre de 39 grados. El suyo ha sido un romance neoyorquino: un inmigrante tailand\u00e9s llamado Jack, bajo y compacto, conoce a un nativo de Alabama llamado Joe, alto y delgado, en un bar del Bowery en 2005. Participan en el consabido intercambio de n\u00fameros de tel\u00e9fono, pero entonces Jack sorprende a Joe al llamar. \u201cMe cortej\u00f3\u201d, dice Joe. En la unida comunidad de la cocina tailandesa de la ciudad, Jack, de 53 a\u00f1os, es conocido por ser exigente pero atento: r\u00edgido en cuanto a la higiene y la rapidez y luego, despu\u00e9s de que se haya servido el \u00faltimo plato de curry, dispuesto para una copa de Riesling y una alentadora charla con sus colegas reci\u00e9n llegados a Estados Unidos. Bas\u00e1ndose en su propia vida \u2014nacido en la ciudad tailandesa de Ubon Ratchathani, perdi\u00f3 a sus dos padres cuando era joven, emigr\u00f3 en 1990 sin perspectivas\u2014 Jack les dice que sean fuertes. Cuenta historias sobre su suerte en los casinos, y los invita a ver a sus amados Giants y a compartir la comida picante que ha cocinado y que los hace sentirse como en casa. Lo apodan Mam\u00e1. Su pareja, Joe, de 58 a\u00f1os, creci\u00f3 en la peque\u00f1a ciudad de Jasper y estudi\u00f3 m\u00fasica en la Universidad de Alabama. Ense\u00f1\u00f3 ingl\u00e9s en Taiw\u00e1n durante un a\u00f1o, y luego se mud\u00f3 a Nueva York a principios de los 90. Despu\u00e9s de un largo per\u00edodo como mesero, se dedic\u00f3 a la investigaci\u00f3n de mercado y ahora trabaja como director de proyectos desde el apartamento que ha compartido con Jack durante dos a\u00f1os. En un rinc\u00f3n se encuentra el peque\u00f1o santuario de Jack a Buda y una vajilla desigual para el restaurante que espera abrir alg\u00fan d\u00eda. En otra esquina est\u00e1 el piano digital que compr\u00f3 para que Joe reavivara su pasi\u00f3n por la m\u00fasica. Ahora, este s\u00e1bado por la ma\u00f1ana, Jack le env\u00eda mensajes a Joe desde el dormitorio de ambos. 11:43 a.m.: Mi prueba es positiva 11:43 a.m.: El Dr. dijo que bebiera m\u00e1s agua 11:45 a.m.: Tomar la medicina para el Virus 11:50 a.m.: Comenzar a separar tenedor cuchara 11:50 a.m.: Usar la protecci\u00f3n de la mascarilla 11:50 a.m.: Cada vez 12:07 p.m.: Lo siento \u2014 El presidente Trump Los cielos son de plomo, cae una mezcla invernal. Todo en consonancia con el estado de \u00e1nimo de Queens. Dentro del Hospital Elmhurst, Vicenta Flores est\u00e1 en un respirador, inconsciente y sola. No se permiten visitas, pero de todos modos muchos en el peque\u00f1o apartamento de su familia en Corona est\u00e1n demasiado enfermos para ir a verla, entre ellos dos nietos que comparten un nebulizador para el asma. Rosa Lema, la hija de Vicenta, est\u00e1 tan enferma que se ha hecho la prueba del coronavirus. Mientras tanto, la artista Yimel Alvarado permanece sedada y con un ventilador en su capullo de pl\u00e1stico transparente. Con la ayuda de un integrante de la Familia Alvarado que habla ingl\u00e9s, su hermana Olivia ha estado llamando dos veces al d\u00eda para saber c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 Yimel, cuyo propio resultado de la prueba ha llegado finalmente: positivo. Los casos de covid han sobrepasado el departamento de emergencias. Hace unas semanas, la opini\u00f3n general era que las cuatro salas de aislamiento de presi\u00f3n negativa del hospital pod\u00edan manejar cualquier caso infeccioso que se presentase. La idea ahora parece absurda. Para Stuart Kessler, el director de urgencias, los d\u00edas son una crisis prolongada bajo luces fluorescentes. Un nativo de Queens que creci\u00f3 en Bayside, 11 kil\u00f3metros al este, tiene grandes ojos dormilones y un aire de \u201chaberlo visto todo\u201d que ha ganado durante d\u00e9cadas como m\u00e9dico de urgencias en los hospitales de grandes ciudades. Pero nunca ha visto progresar una enfermedad como este virus, y est\u00e1 instando a sus compa\u00f1eros de todo el pa\u00eds a que rechacen el pensamiento convencional y se preparen para algo totalmente desconocido. Sus palabras de advertencia no parecen escucharse. Si no lo has vivido, decide, no puedes entenderlo. Afuera del hospital, barricadas gris acero gu\u00edan a un grupo de personas maltratadas por la lluvia hacia un lugar donde se hacen pruebas en una tienda de campa\u00f1a cerca de la entrada de emergencias. Inclinados bajo los paraguas, encorvados contra el fr\u00edo, forman una columna diaria de pavor. Francisco Moya, el concejal local, pasa por la fila despu\u00e9s de entregar 1000 mascarillas al hospital donde naci\u00f3 hace 46 a\u00f1os y donde una vez trabaj\u00f3 como administrador. Hijo de inmigrantes ecuatorianos que se establecieron en Corona, es una presencia familiar y barbuda por aqu\u00ed, que tambi\u00e9n ha servido como organizador comunitario y asamble\u00edsta estatal. Est\u00e1 desconsolado y enojado por ver a tantos \u2014muchos de ellos inmigrantes sin seguro\u2014, amontonados en la desesperaci\u00f3n. Parece una escena de un pa\u00eds devastado por la guerra, no del suyo. Cuando los casos confirmados de la ciudad se duplican cada semana, Moya est\u00e1 entre los que dan la alarma. En las redes sociales y en llamadas a la alcald\u00eda, afirma que el Hospital Elmhurst est\u00e1 sobrecargado y necesita urgentemente m\u00e9dicos, enfermeros, ventiladores y equipos de protecci\u00f3n personal. Es cierto: a muchos en Queens les falta casi todo, menos desesperaci\u00f3n. Pero docenas de organizaciones locales trabajan para llenar el vac\u00edo. A pocas cuadras del Hospital Elmhurst, un joven im\u00e1n de Banglad\u00e9s convierte su mezquita, el Centro Cultural An-Noor, en un almac\u00e9n improvisado; la alfombra de la sala de oraci\u00f3n pronto se cubrir\u00e1 con alimentos halal donados. Con la magia de su hijo de 13 a\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n publica videos diarios en las redes sociales para mantener informados a sus feligreses aislados. En Woodside, Luis Gaguancela, un contratista desempleado de Ecuador ofrece servicios voluntarios en Facebook a sus compa\u00f1eros de la iglesia Aliento de Vida. \u201cMis hermanos, Dios los bendiga\u201d, escribe. \u201cPara los que necesitan salir a comprar v\u00edveres o alguna emergencia y necesitan transportaci\u00f3n, me ofrezco a llevarlos completamente gratis\u201d. Y en Jackson Heights, una vieja iglesia luterana vibra con la precisi\u00f3n de una l\u00ednea de montaje. El edificio es ahora un templo budista y sede de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Sherpas Unidos, que asiste a los inmigrantes de Nepal, T\u00edbet y But\u00e1n. Entre sus miembros est\u00e1 Dawa Sherpa, el conductor de Uber, que participa activamente en su programa de deportes juveniles. En el segundo piso, donde una bufanda blanca llamada khata cubre una viga en se\u00f1al de bienvenida, los voluntarios hacen paquetes de cuidado para los enfermos, confinados en casa y asustados. Han estado buscando a toda hora guantes, mascarillas y desinfectante para las manos, y los integrantes que se dedican al negocio de importaci\u00f3n llaman a sus contactos en Asia a altas horas de la noche. Pero parece que no tienen suficiente de un art\u00edculo que antes abundaba: Tylenol. Joe Farris, que vive a una corta cuadra del edificio Sherpa, ha estado en la misma b\u00fasqueda. Su pareja, Jack Wongserat, intenta mantenerse en forma durante su enfermedad, haciendo estiramientos en una manta que ha dejado en el suelo junto a la cama. Pero su tos seca es incesante. En busca de aliviar el dolor de Jack, Joe camina por las calles extra\u00f1amente tranquilas de Queens en busca de alcohol isoprop\u00edlico, zinc, tabletas de vitamina C y Tylenol. Nada en la farmacia Duane Reade. Nada en Walgreens. Lo mejor que puede hacer es conseguir dos term\u00f3metros. Joe tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 mal. Tose y ha perdido el sentido del olfato, que se dice que es un s\u00edntoma de covid. El otro d\u00eda se puso la mu\u00f1eca en la nariz y no pudo sentir su colonia. Los dos hombres al menos tienen un plan. Limpian todo con hisopos de alcohol y guardan los cubiertos por separado en recipientes de pl\u00e1stico marcados con sus nombres. Joe duerme en la sala de estar. A\u00fan as\u00ed, Jack parece estar pensando en el futuro. Mientras Joe est\u00e1 en la cocina, donde las especias de Jack ocupan cuatro estantes, oye a su compa\u00f1ero murmurar palabras alarmantes mientras pasa de largo. No tengo miedo de morir. Tengo 53 a\u00f1os. He tenido una buena vida. \u2014 El gobernador Cuomo A poco m\u00e1s de un kil\u00f3metro al norte, en East Elmhurst, Mahdia Chowdhury est\u00e1 en casa tras regresar de la Universidad de Cornell y se le va el sue\u00f1o en el peque\u00f1o apartamento del segundo piso de su familia, en el dormitorio que comparte con sus dos hermanos adolescentes. Afuera, las ambulancias son tan comunes que por la noche sus luces pintan de rojo el techo de su dormitorio. En el interior, su padre, Shamsul, se pone m\u00e1s enfermo cada d\u00eda. Hace unos d\u00edas dej\u00f3 de ir a su mezquita y devolvi\u00f3 el Toyota Prius amarillo que hab\u00eda rentado con un compa\u00f1ero a un garaje de taxis en la zona de Queens llamada Long Island City, tal como ella le rog\u00f3 que hiciera por los riesgos para su salud. Demasiado tarde. Ahora, todas las noches, viene a su habitaci\u00f3n para preguntarle si su \u201cdisenter\u00eda\u201d \u2014su t\u00e9rmino para fiebre y diarrea\u2014 significa que tiene covid. No, miente la hija para tranquilizarlo. Est\u00e1s bien. Aunque sus padres duermen en la misma cama, Mahdia no est\u00e1 tan preocupada por su madre, Tarana, de 47 a\u00f1os, que sigue trabajando sirviendo comida y limpiando en la sala de United Airlines en el cercano aeropuerto de La Guardia. Est\u00e1 casi vac\u00eda ahora, el rugido constante de los aviones sobre la cabeza ha quedado pr\u00e1cticamente silenciado. Su padre es el que le preocupa. Dejando a un lado sus tareas universitarias para investigar los s\u00edntomas de la covid, se ha convencido de que est\u00e1 infectado y, como es diab\u00e9tico y fumador, corre un gran riesgo. Tiene 48 a\u00f1os. Hace unos d\u00edas, Mahdia estaba en la biblioteca de su campus en medio de colinas a 380 kil\u00f3metros de distancia, estudiando para los ex\u00e1menes de mitad de curso. Ahora est\u00e1 acostada pero despierta mientras sus hermanos duermen. Shamsul parece m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil. Apenas toca el arroz que la familia deja fuera de la puerta de su dormitorio, bajo un talism\u00e1n de un ojo azul destinado a ahuyentar el mal. Piensa en los silenciosos sacrificios de su padre. En la ciudad banglades\u00ed de Sylhet pose\u00eda tierras y ten\u00eda una maestr\u00eda. Era parte de la clase privilegiada. Shamsul, serio y meticuloso, dej\u00f3 todo eso en 2009 para dar m\u00e1s oportunidades a sus hijos en Estados Unidos, donde, en lugar de gestionar las operaciones en un banco de Sylhet, llevaba a Mahdia y a sus hermanos a la escuela todas las ma\u00f1anas en el taxi que conduc\u00eda 10 horas al d\u00eda. Ya no parece tan deprimido como cuando llegaron, aunque las finanzas de la familia siguen siendo una preocupaci\u00f3n. Teme haberse convertido en un taxista de Nueva York una generaci\u00f3n demasiado tarde; teme que la industria del taxi se estaba derrumbando incluso antes de la pandemia; teme que \u00e9l y su esposa nunca puedan permitirse una casa. Ahora Shamsul va al ba\u00f1o en pijamas sueltos y chanclas, protegiendo sus ojos de la luz. \u00bfCrees que lo tengo? Mahdia, peque\u00f1a y pr\u00e1ctica, con su gruesa melena negra a la altura de los hombros, suele encargarse del papeleo de la familia, una tarea habitual para los hijos mayores de los inmigrantes. Ella ser\u00e1 la que decida qu\u00e9 hacer. \u00bfDeber\u00eda esperar antes de enviarlo al Hospital Elmhurst, que se rumorea que est\u00e1 rebasado? \u00bfO deber\u00eda llevarlo all\u00ed mientras pueda? Se imagina marcando fren\u00e9ticamente el 911 alguna noche, solo para enterarse de que todas las ambulancias ya han sido ocupadas. Otra ambulancia chillona se apresura a bajar su cuadra con otra persona enferma. Desde su ventana ha visto los guantes de goma usados que descartan los param\u00e9dicos en la calle. \u2014 Mike Pence, vicepresidente Jack Wongserat exige que se le entregue un envase de comida para llevar para llenar una orden. Se molesta cuando no hay uno disponible, y luego se sienta a marcar el tel\u00e9fono. Pero no hay envases de comida para llevar. No hay tel\u00e9fono. Tampoco est\u00e1 trabajando en un restaurante tailand\u00e9s en Manhattan en esta fr\u00eda y nublada ma\u00f1ana. Jack est\u00e1 en su apartamento en Woodside, en los estertores de una alucinaci\u00f3n. Para esta noche, gran parte del pa\u00eds se habr\u00e1 deshecho de cualquier ilusi\u00f3n sobre el virus, en parte gracias a Jack. Su pareja, Joe, lo coloca en una silla confortable en su dormitorio, y luego lo lleva a la cama, esperando que duerma. Pero pronto Jack est\u00e1 jadeando, le falta el aire. Cuando Joe lo gira r\u00e1pidamente de lado, ambos se estrellan contra el suelo. Joe llama al 911 e intenta seguir las instrucciones del operador para administrar la RCP. La ambulancia, por supuesto, parece tardar una eternidad. Los param\u00e9dicos arrojan la silla beige sobre la cama para hacer espacio, luego bajan a Jack en camilla al atrio. Mientras cinco param\u00e9dicos lo llevan a la ambulancia, su est\u00f3mago sube y baja en fren\u00e9tica medida de su b\u00fasqueda de aliento. Dios m\u00edo, dice una vecina que mira desde su ventana. Ay no, ay Dios m\u00edo, que Dios lo bendiga. Joe corre al Hospital Elmhurst, y encuentra a Jack intubado e inconsciente en una cama en el frenes\u00ed controlado del atestado departamento de emergencias. Las camas pasan rodando, incluyendo una que lleva a un paciente que parece estar muerto. Una cortina corrida en un rinc\u00f3n proporciona una m\u00ednima privacidad para dos hombres que han compartido un v\u00ednculo entre Alabama y Tailandia durante 15 a\u00f1os. Ante la remota posibilidad de que Jack pueda o\u00edr, Joe habla. Todo va a estar bien. Est\u00e1s en paz. Un m\u00e9dico explica que la p\u00e9rdida de ox\u00edgeno ha causado un da\u00f1o cerebral significativo y permanente. Se excusa para darle tiempo a Joe para decidir si se debe hacer todo o nada para mantener a Jack con vida. Para Joe, la \u00fanica opci\u00f3n es la que Jack querr\u00eda. Acepta y firma el formulario de No Resucitar. Sentado al lado de su compa\u00f1ero de vida, Joe pierde todo sentido del tiempo. En un momento el latido del coraz\u00f3n de Jack se vuelve err\u00e1tico, pero un colega le aconseja a un m\u00e9dico que se apresura a venir que no intervenga: el paciente no debe ser resucitado. El coraz\u00f3n de Jack se detiene. Dos trabajadores sociales aparecen al lado de Joe para proporcionarle consuelo y una lista de funerarias. Uno de ellos recomienda que haga los arreglos inmediatamente, dada la repentina demanda. Jack Wongserat es una de las 13 personas que morir\u00e1n en el Hospital Elmhurst en el lapso de 24 horas. El c\u00f3digo del hospital para la intervenci\u00f3n de emergencia \u2014Equipo 700\u2014 resuena por el altavoz, mientras que un cami\u00f3n refrigerado que ha llegado hace poco emite un zumbido afuera, preparado para recibir. La cantidad de pacientes es tan abrumadora que los m\u00e9dicos y enfermeros de emergencia ya no se ponen mascarillas N95 nuevas cada vez que se acercan otro m\u00e1s. Llevar\u00eda demasiado tiempo y consumir\u00edan demasiadas. La petici\u00f3n de ayuda de una m\u00e9dico del Hospital Elmhurst, transmitida en un video publicado por The New York Times, difunde la situaci\u00f3n cada vez m\u00e1s sombr\u00eda. La doctora, Colleen Smith, dice que el departamento de emergencias est\u00e1 atendiendo a 400 pacientes al d\u00eda \u2014casi el doble de lo normal\u2014 mientras que los suministros disminuyen y multitudes esperan evaluaciones m\u00e9dicas. \u201cEsto es malo. La gente est\u00e1 muriendo\u201d, dice Smith en el video. \u201cEn el departamento de emergencias y en el hospital no tenemos las herramientas que necesitamos para atenderlos\u201d. Al anochecer, el distrito de Queens \u2014y espec\u00edficamente el Hospital Elmhurst\u2014 ser\u00e1 conocido como el epicentro de la pandemia en Nueva York, si no en Estados Unidos. Para muchos estadounidenses, el coronavirus pasar\u00e1 de ser una amenaza abstracta a un horror de la vida real. Epicentro. Una y otra vez, la palabra ser\u00e1 repetida por el presidente y el gobernador, por los peri\u00f3dicos y las emisoras. Los funcionarios de la ciudad pronto dar\u00e1n a conocer datos que muestran que estos barrios, que entrelazan c\u00f3digos postales que contienen el mundo, encabezan la lista de las zonas m\u00e1s afectadas de Nueva York. Pero ahora mismo solo est\u00e1 Joe Farris solo, caminando a casa en una tarde gris. Se dirige por la Avenida 41, pasa una farmacia espa\u00f1ola, una iglesia china y la antigua iglesia luterana donde la gente de ascendencia sherpa est\u00e1 armando los paquetes de cuidado para covid. Se encuentra en estado de shock, su mente es un revoltijo de cada pensamiento y ning\u00fan pensamiento. Todo lo que sabe con certeza es que una pandemia en Queens se ha llevado a su amor. \u2014 El alcalde De Blasio El d\u00eda de las 13 muertes en el Hospital Elmhurst fue dif\u00edcil, horrible, tr\u00e1gico. Pero para Laura Iavicoli, directora asociada del departamento de emergencias, no fue el peor d\u00eda. El peor sucede dos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s: hoy. Ella se describe a s\u00ed misma como una orgullosa chica de Filadelfia cuyo pelo negro hasta los hombros anula su bata blanca de laboratorio. As\u00ed es como ha querido ser desde la escuela primaria, despu\u00e9s de que su mejor amiga fue atropellada por un coche y sufri\u00f3 una lesi\u00f3n cerebral, y luego los m\u00e9dicos de emergencias la salvaron. Tambi\u00e9n es muy motivada, alguien que se descomprime batallando para conseguir un cintur\u00f3n negro en artes marciales mixtas y cuya idea de relajarse es beber caf\u00e9 colombiano, con mucha leche, mientras trabaja en su port\u00e1til en una cafeter\u00eda. La relajaci\u00f3n es ahora un concepto extra\u00f1o. Desde el brote del coronavirus, sale temprano del apartamento de su familia en el Upper West Side, regresa tarde y evita hablar de su d\u00eda. No hay necesidad de preocupar a sus tres hijas, que tienen 12, 10 y 9 a\u00f1os. Esta ma\u00f1ana, Iavicoli se pone su casco negro y monta su bicicleta, una Fuji Oval roja y negra que su marido compr\u00f3 hace una semana por 250 d\u00f3lares. Es el reemplazo de los trotes relajantes para los que ya no tiene tiempo. Va en bicicleta a trav\u00e9s de Central Park, sobre el puente de la calle 59 y hacia Queens, con destino a su ahora famoso lugar de trabajo. Su orgullo por el Hospital Elmhurst sigue fuerte, pero es testigo de que la instituci\u00f3n est\u00e1 siendo probada hasta sus l\u00edmites. Uno de sus colegas llama a la situaci\u00f3n apocal\u00edptica; otro la comparar\u00e1 con el Infierno de Dante A \u00faltima hora de la tarde, se apresura a unirse a Kessler para otra teleconferencia relacionada con la pandemia, pero en el camino se sorprende de c\u00f3mo los enfermos de covid han sobrepasado al departamento de emergencias. En las camas, detr\u00e1s de las cortinas, en el pasillo, en la sala de espera, en todas partes. Apenas puede ver el p\u00e1lido suelo de baldosas. Olvida la conferencia telef\u00f3nica, le dice a Kessler. Los dos supervisores se unen al grupo de profesionales de la salud que trabajan sin parar para mantener a raya un virus mortal en una esquina de Queens. Revisan las camas, llevan suministros, trasladan a los pacientes, lo que sea necesario. En este teatro de vida o muerte, el tiempo se vuelve eterno. Cuando Iavicoli recuerde esta noche en los d\u00edas venideros, su dura identidad de Filadelfia se quebrar\u00e1 al describir una escena simult\u00e1neamente fren\u00e9tica y met\u00f3dica, estresante y genial: una escena de gente trabajando en concierto para mantener a otros con vida. Los m\u00e9dicos ajustando los ventiladores. Los enfermeros calibrando las gotas. Equipos corriendo para monitorear los niveles de ox\u00edgeno, reemplazar los tanques y cambiar la posici\u00f3n de los pacientes para facilitarles la respiraci\u00f3n. Pero darlo todo no siempre es suficiente. Antes del amanecer de esta ma\u00f1ana, un tel\u00e9fono celular que suena interrumpe el sue\u00f1o en el apartamento del Bronx de Olivia Aldama, la hermana de Yimel. La persona que llama est\u00e1 hablando en ingl\u00e9s, as\u00ed que le pasa el tel\u00e9fono a uno de sus hijos adolescentes, ya despierto. Es el Hospital Elmhurst. La presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea de Yimel ha bajado y su respiraci\u00f3n ha disminuido, dice. Si su coraz\u00f3n se detiene, como lo hizo hace unos d\u00edas, \u00bfdeber\u00edan tratar de revivirla? S\u00ed, s\u00ed, s\u00ed, dice Olivia. Hagan todo lo posible. Cuelgan, y Olivia espera en la oscuridad. La \u00faltima vez que vio a su hermana fue hace casi dos semanas, el d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que Yimel fue hospitalizada. Hab\u00eda esperado en vano durante 12 horas, aguardando una actualizaci\u00f3n de la condici\u00f3n de Yimel, antes de finalmente reunir su coraje y entrar en la UCI tarde esa noche. Los enfermeros ni siquiera la miraron. No s\u00e9 si Dios me hizo invisible, pens\u00f3 Olivia. Ah\u00ed encontr\u00f3 a su hermana, sedada en una habitaci\u00f3n sellada con vidrio. Incluso con los tubos enrollados alrededor de su cara, Yimel luc\u00eda digna, con el ment\u00f3n levantado, los ojos cerrados bajo unas cejas finas y arqueadas. El tel\u00e9fono suena de nuevo. Esta vez, un servicio de traducci\u00f3n del hospital llama para decir que Yimel \u2014su Chiquis\u2014 ha muerto. Olivia no puede volver a dormir. En unas pocas horas, piensa, le pedir\u00e1 a alguien que hable ingl\u00e9s que llame al hospital para asegurarse de que es cierto. M\u00e1s tarde esta ma\u00f1ana, en una oscura habitaci\u00f3n en Corona, Rosa Lema yace despierta en s\u00e1banas h\u00famedas de otra noche febril. Su mente da vueltas. Su cu\u00f1ado, el de los azulejos, acaba de irse al hospital con s\u00edntomas graves. Los resultados de las pruebas de Rosa han mostrado no solo que tiene el coronavirus, sino tambi\u00e9n que est\u00e1 embarazada. D\u00e9bil y sin aliento, no quiere moverse. Pero desde su cama escucha un sonido que interrumpe el habitual murmullo de conversaciones del apartamento. Una de sus hijas, sollozando. Rosa se las arregla para levantarse y entrar en la sala. Su marido, que acaba de perder su trabajo en la construcci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 llorando; la toma en sus brazos. Su hermana Carmen, que acaba de perder su trabajo limpiando casas, ha dejado de hacer el almuerzo y consuela a la hija de nueve a\u00f1os de Rosa. Rosa asimila la escena, y lo sabe. Su hermano Jorge ha llamado con una noticia devastadora: Se nos fue la vieja. Perdimos a nuestra madre. La familia no ha sabido casi nada del Hospital Elmhurst desde que Vicenta fue ingresada e intubada hace una semana. No hubo ninguna advertencia de que su condici\u00f3n se hab\u00eda deteriorado. No hubo oportunidad de despedirse, ni siquiera por video. Pronto, los seis hijos de Vicenta Flores van a batallar para encontrar una funeraria que recoja su cuerpo del hospital, que exige que lo retiren lo antes posible. Tendr\u00e1n que mantener dif\u00edciles discusiones por videoconferencia sobre la cremaci\u00f3n, que, seg\u00fan el consulado, es ahora la \u00fanica manera de enviar los restos de las personas que murieron de covid de vuelta a Ecuador. Y tendr\u00e1n que decidir cu\u00e1ndo decirle a su padre, Jos\u00e9, que permanece en un centro de rehabilitaci\u00f3n local, que su esposa de medio siglo ha muerto. Pero en este momento, todo el mundo est\u00e1 llorando por la p\u00e9rdida de su abuelita. Carmen se mueve para abrazar a Rosa, pero su hermana se da la vuelta y se dirige de nuevo a su cama. Pronto, desde detr\u00e1s de la puerta de Rosa, viene el sonido del llanto. Son casi las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana cuando Iavicoli se pone el casco. La doctora gu\u00eda su nueva bicicleta fuera de la oficina, por un pasillo vac\u00edo y hacia fuera en la noche tranquila. Con la tienda blanca y el cami\u00f3n refrigerado detr\u00e1s de ella, pasa en bicicleta por una tienda de comestibles mexicana, un par de restaurantes tailandeses, un templo hind\u00fa, un centro cultural musulm\u00e1n, un servicio de impuestos para hispanohablantes. Queens. Sabe que cuando llegue a su apartamento, su marido habr\u00e1 dispuesto el desinfectante de manos y las toallitas desinfectantes. Tirar\u00e1 su ropa en la lavander\u00eda y se dar\u00e1 una ducha caliente. Tiene 50 minutos antes de llegar a su puerta para dejar atr\u00e1s el d\u00eda lleno de pandemia. Piensa en lo que ha ido bien, en lo que podr\u00eda haber ido mejor y c\u00f3mo. Se pregunta cu\u00e1ndo terminar\u00e1n la muerte y la enfermedad. La doctora gira a la izquierda en la Avenida Roosevelt, donde las v\u00edas elevadas del metro crean un techo esquel\u00e9tico. Se siente como si se estuviera moviendo a trav\u00e9s de alg\u00fan universo alternativo. Como si la gran metr\u00f3poli de Nueva York estuviera en un shock paralizante. Va por calles de la ciudad tan tranquilas como las del campo, y luego al puente de la calle 59. Iavicoli puede ver el r\u00edo Este a trav\u00e9s de las rejas met\u00e1licas bajo sus llantas, y luego partes de Roosevelt Island, donde su querido lugar de trabajo comenz\u00f3 a funcionar hace casi 200 a\u00f1os. Sale del puente y se desliza como en un sue\u00f1o por un Manhattan silencioso. El aire fresco de la ciudad le despeja la mente, le permite deshacerse del d\u00eda como una bata de laboratorio tirada. Arriba por la Primera Avenida. A lo largo de la calle 66. A trav\u00e9s del oscuro santuario de Central Park hacia el Upper West Side. A casa. \u2014 Anthony Fauci, director del Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas Dawa Sherpa ha estado enfermo durante m\u00e1s de una semana. Tosiendo. Aletargado. Sin apetito. Con problemas para respirar. Su esposa, Sita Rai, lo persigue mientras va por el apartamento de Woodside, limpiando con desinfectante todo lo que toca. Pero est\u00e1 tan d\u00e9bil esta noche que ella llama a una ambulancia. Se abre paso por los escalones alfombrados de gris, pasa por la fila descendente de los zapatos de la familia, y se queda sin aliento por el esfuerzo. Dawa es trasladado al Hospital Elmhurst, a menos de un kil\u00f3metro, donde se siguen desarrollando protocolos en el momento para lo que ahora se considera un evento en curso con m\u00faltiples v\u00edctimas. La noticia de la \u00faltima semana de 13 muertes en un d\u00eda ha provocado una avalancha de apoyo en donaciones de mascarillas y otros suministros. Y, pronto, los traslados de pacientes aliviar\u00e1n el hacinamiento. Pero la publicidad tambi\u00e9n ha alimentado un preocupante malentendido entre algunos residentes locales, basado en cosas siniestras que han visto y o\u00eddo. El cami\u00f3n refrigerador. Las sirenas de las ambulancias. Las largas filas. El r\u00edtmico ruido de los helic\u00f3pteros de las noticias que revolotean. Se corre la voz de que nadie que entra en el Hospital Elmhurst sale vivo. La f\u00e1brica local de rumores convierte las 13 muertes en 15, 25, 1000. La informaci\u00f3n falsa ha convencido a algunos de enfrentar a la covid por su cuenta en casa, armados con poco m\u00e1s que t\u00e9 y, con algo de suerte, Tylenol. Puede ser una decisi\u00f3n fatal. Pero como muchos otros, Dawa ha elegido confiar en los m\u00e9dicos de Elmhurst. Se le lleva a una peque\u00f1a zona donde otros, sentados en sillas disparejas, obtienen ox\u00edgeno de varios aparatos. El hospital no tiene otra opci\u00f3n que agrupar a los enfermos. Algunos hablan en espa\u00f1ol por celular, otros lloran de miedo. \u00c9l comparte su terror. Sabe que otro conductor de Uber de Nepal, padre de tres hijos, muri\u00f3 hace poco a causa del virus en este hospital. Ese hombre era un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s joven que Dawa. El exmonje est\u00e1 conectado a un generador de ox\u00edgeno. Para mantener la calma, recita una oraci\u00f3n en su cabeza que invoca y evoca la encarnaci\u00f3n de la compasi\u00f3n de Buda: Sol wa deb so la ma chen re zig, Sol wa deb so yi dam chen re zig \u2026 A Queens le vienen bien las oraciones. Las calles est\u00e1n desiertas. Los letreros en el restaurante cerrado Himalayan Yak y en la Escuela Popular de Manejo, el Afghan Kebab and Grill y la tienda S.M. Digital Sign & Printing, todos ofrecen la misma raz\u00f3n: Debido a la crisis de COVID-19\u2026 Trump hoy solo intensifica el estado de \u00e1nimo apocal\u00edptico. Ha seguido restando importancia a la crisis, pero los informes de noticias de su distrito natal \u2014se cri\u00f3 en una urbanizaci\u00f3n pudiente de Jamaica, a menos de nueve kil\u00f3metros del Hospital Elmhurst\u2014 parecen hacer pausar al presidente por un momento. \u201cCuando veo que los camiones se detienen para sacar los cuerpos \u2014y estos son camiones tan largos como el Jard\u00edn de las Rosas, y se est\u00e1n deteniendo para sacar los cuerpos\u2014 y miras dentro y ves las bolsas negras para cad\u00e1veres\u201d, dice. \u201cY dices, \u2018\u00bfQu\u00e9 hay ah\u00ed? Es el Hospital Elmhurst. Deben ser suministros\u2019\u201d. \u201cNo son suministros. Es gente\u201d. Algunos funcionarios locales y defensores del vecindario est\u00e1n demasiado furiosos para ocuparse de reflexiones macabras. Han estado denunciando lo que ven como la falta de respuesta adecuada del gobierno a una pandemia en una comunidad de inmigrantes famosa por sus condiciones de hacinamiento. Pero todos se ven obligados a adaptarse, incluyendo al capit\u00e1n Cermeli de la comisar\u00eda 110 en Elmhurst, donde m\u00e1s de un tercio de los agentes est\u00e1n de baja por enfermedad. Con su pelo corto y su impecable camisa blanca de uniforme, el capit\u00e1n Cermeli, de 39 a\u00f1os, irradia orden. En su oficina de la comisar\u00eda, la disposici\u00f3n de las fotograf\u00edas familiares, los dibujos con crayones, los premios y honores, es toda as\u00ed. \u00bfPero c\u00f3mo se aplica el orden a una amenaza invisible? Al Queens en el que creciste, pero que ahora apenas reconoces: sin corrientes de pasajeros que bajen por las escaleras desde el tren elevado 7. Sin multitudes que peregrinan para animar a los Mets en Citi Field. Sin compradores en el centro comercial Queens Center. Hoy en d\u00eda, los oficiales de Cermeli protegen contra los robos en tiendas cerradas y sin vigilancia. Recorren el Flushing Meadows Corona Park, emitiendo recordatorios por altavoz para mantener el distanciamiento social. Hacen guardia a los que han muerto en casa hasta que los cuerpos puedan ser recogidos. Cuando regresa a su casa de Long Island por la noche, el capit\u00e1n Cermeli entra por el garaje, se ducha y se esfuerza por no abrazar a sus dos hijos, de 12 y 9 a\u00f1os. Hace a\u00f1os, en una estancia anterior, el capit\u00e1n encontr\u00f3 un crucifijo de cristal detr\u00e1s de uno de los archivadores de la comisar\u00eda 110. Cuando regres\u00f3 como comandante en febrero, lo colg\u00f3 en una pared de su oficina. Ahora se toma el tiempo de pararse ante el crucifijo y, como Dawa Sherpa, rezar para que vengan d\u00edas mejores. Mant\u00e9n a mi familia a salvo. Mant\u00e9n a mis hombres y mujeres a salvo. Mantenme a salvo. Dawa se sienta en un rinc\u00f3n de la sala de emergencias. Se sienta mientras el domingo por la noche se convierte en lunes, y el lunes en martes. De vez en cuando estira las piernas y pone su chaqueta negra sobre su silla acolchada para reservarla. Le pregunta a las enfermeras que controlan sus signos vitales si hay una cama, solo para que le digan que a\u00fan no. Tiene hambre y le dan un s\u00e1ndwich, pero no puede comer. Se las arregla con jugo, agua, ox\u00edgeno y oraci\u00f3n. Sol wa deb so la ma chen re zig, Sol wa deb so yi dam chen re zig \u2026 El martes se convierte en mi\u00e9rcoles. Finalmente, Dawa es llevado a una habitaci\u00f3n en el tercer piso. Se despoja de su ropa marchita para ponerse una bata de hospital gris y se instala en la comodidad de una cama por primera vez en cuatro d\u00edas. Su compa\u00f1ero de habitaci\u00f3n, un hombre con el mismo virus, solo habla espa\u00f1ol. A\u00fan as\u00ed, intercambian gestos sencillos de aliento. Un asentimiento. Un pulgar hacia arriba. Un signo de paz. \u2014 El alcalde De Blasio Una minivan Chrysler gris hace sus rondas diarias. Su conductor escucha cualquier cosa que le distraiga, desde deportes a hip-hop o Johnny Cash. Ahora bebe Gatorade en vez de caf\u00e9, ya tiene bastantes problemas para dormir. Este es Tom Habermann, 34 a\u00f1os, gerente y funerario residente de Guida Funeral Home. Delgado y agotado, lleva jeans y un su\u00e9ter en lugar de su habitual atuendo de trabajo de color negro sombr\u00edo. La muerte es demasiado com\u00fan para cualquier formalidad. Pasa estos d\u00edas conduciendo de hospital en hospital, recogiendo cuerpos. No hay tiempo para embalsamar, o elegir arreglos florales, o reunir portadores de f\u00e9retros. Solo tiene que deslizar bolsas para cad\u00e1veres en la parte trasera de la minivan, una y otra vez. La funeraria Guida, una empresa familiar de Corona desde hace m\u00e1s de un siglo, suele encargarse de unas 100 muertes al a\u00f1o. Esta primavera en solo ocho semanas casi igualar\u00e1 ese n\u00famero. Se ha contratado un servicio de telefonista para atender las numerosas llamadas de personas que piden ayuda, ahora que algunas funerarias se niegan a aceptar a las v\u00edctimas del virus o est\u00e1n demasiado ocupadas para siquiera contestar el tel\u00e9fono. Habermann y Eddie Guida Jr., el due\u00f1o de la funeraria y su mejor amigo de la secundaria, hacen lo que pueden. Se ven a s\u00ed mismos realizando un deber sombr\u00edo pero necesario en un momento en el que los rituales de luto se han puesto patas arriba. Los \u00faltimos en responder. Pero el volumen es demasiado grande. Los hospitales y funerarias no tienen suficiente espacio para todos los cuerpos; los crematorios y cementerios no tienen suficiente tiempo. Un crematorio local ofreci\u00f3 hace poco: Puedes venir el pr\u00f3ximo viernes, pero trae solo dos. Guida, de 34 a\u00f1os, fornido y tatuado, ha recurrido a sus muchas conexiones. Un t\u00edo tiene un amigo en Long Island que ha proporcionado un cami\u00f3n refrigerado de 16 por 2 metros, y uno de sus primos es due\u00f1o de un lote vac\u00edo en las cercan\u00edas. Ah\u00ed es donde el cami\u00f3n estacionado ahora ronronea con la temperatura fija en 0 grados. Pronto albergar\u00e1 casi 50 cuerpos. Guida siente la presi\u00f3n de administrar el negocio de su familia, que tiene antig\u00fcedad suficiente para haber manejado las muertes durante la pandemia de gripe de 1918. Le preocupa que la funeraria no sea capaz de mantener el ritmo de la demanda. Pero Habermann es el que tiene que recoger los cuerpos. Luego tiene que arreglar los rasgos del rostro de los muertos para hacer simples fotos de la cabeza que permitan tanto la identificaci\u00f3n como un cierto cierre para las familias a las que se les ha negado el velorio y la \u00faltima oportunidad de verlos. Lleva su minivan al Hospital Elmhurst. Al Hospital Flushing. Al Hospital de Coney Island. Al Hospital Mather en Long Island. De vuelta a la funeraria. Luego al cami\u00f3n. A veces Habermann escucha la radio mientras conduce. A veces piensa en las remodelaciones de su apartamento que \u00e9l y su mujer nunca parecen poder terminar. A veces se pregunta cu\u00e1ndo volver\u00e1 la muerte a la normalidad. A veces, al final del d\u00eda, la fachada profesional se agrieta y el agente funerario llora. Las noticias de este d\u00eda nublado no son solo malas, anuncia el gobernador Cuomo. Son terribles. El estado de Nueva York acaba de registrar la mayor cantidad de muertes en un solo d\u00eda como resultado del coronavirus: 779. A medida que se cuenten m\u00e1s p\u00e9rdidas en los pr\u00f3ximos meses, el n\u00famero cambiar\u00e1 ligeramente. Pero este lapso de d\u00edas seguir\u00e1 siendo un hito oscuro: el momento m\u00e1s mortal del virus en Nueva York. La ciudad tambi\u00e9n ha publicado algunas nuevas e inquietantes estad\u00edsticas. El virus est\u00e1 matando a las personas negras y latinas al doble que a las blancas. \u201cCada n\u00famero es un rostro\u201d, dice el gobernador Desde que el brote comenz\u00f3 hace poco m\u00e1s de un mes, el estado ha contabilizado 6268 muertes. Cuomo se\u00f1ala que esto es m\u00e1s del doble de las vidas perdidas en los ataques del 11 de septiembre al World Trade Center. Pero, dice, tambi\u00e9n hay \u201cbuenas noticias\u201d. El concepto mismo parece tan alejado de la vida en Queens, donde los \u00fanicos sonidos durante esta sombr\u00eda Semana Santa, cuando los cristianos conmemoran la crucifixi\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas, parecen ser las sirenas de las ambulancias y el canto de los p\u00e1jaros de principios de la primavera. Pero los funcionarios de salud de la ciudad y el estado han encontrado un peque\u00f1o resquicio de luz en la envolvente oscuridad: Las admisiones diarias en las unidades de cuidados intensivos han disminuido. Las intubaciones diarias han disminuido. Las hospitalizaciones est\u00e1n comenzando a aplanarse. El hermanamiento de dos simples palabras \u2014buenas noticias\u2014 da ox\u00edgeno a la esperanza. Estas mismas tendencias las observa Israel Rocha Jr., el director ejecutivo del Hospital Elmhurst, cuya vida ha sido un l\u00edo de manejo de crisis y oraci\u00f3n personal las 24 horas del d\u00eda. Pr\u00e1cticamente vive en una sala de conferencias donde se comparten las \u00faltimas estad\u00edsticas, se proponen los \u00faltimos planes, se expresan las \u00faltimas preocupaciones. El hospital hace pruebas a m\u00e1s de 200 pacientes al d\u00eda para detectar el virus, con resultados positivos que ascienden a un asombroso 80 por ciento. Al mismo tiempo, los resultados de sus propios trabajadores son positivos a montones. Pero Rocha, de 42 a\u00f1os, ha visto estad\u00edsticas similares a las que informan las alentadoras palabras del gobernador. Sentado en su oficina, donde una obra de arte en la pared declara que \u201cQueens es el futuro\u201d, ha analizado informes que muestran que los \u00edndices de positividad en Elmhurst se han estabilizado. Por primera vez en m\u00e1s de un mes, el jefe del Hospital de Elmhurst encuentra que respirar es un poco m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. Se acerca la noche, las nubes se separan y un paciente de covid en Elmhurst se prepara para salir. Dawa, el conductor de Uber que una vez fue un monje budista, ha pasado las \u00faltimas nueve noches en el hospital. Mientras se recuperaba, su compa\u00f1ero de habitaci\u00f3n, que siempre le devolv\u00eda el \u00e1nimo con el pulgar hacia arriba, hab\u00eda declinado. Una ma\u00f1ana Dawa se despert\u00f3 junto a una cama vac\u00eda. Se quita la bata de hospital para ponerse la ropa de calle y firma los papeles del alta. Contempla la posibilidad de caminar, pero se da cuenta de que no tiene fuerzas. Toma un Uber para recorrer los 800 metros hasta su casa. \u2014 El gobernador Cuomo Un peque\u00f1o escenario aparece en un estacionamiento junto al restaurante El Trio en Corona. Su tel\u00f3n de fondo de tela escarlata oculta una vieja camioneta Chevy. Maniqu\u00edes con vestidos negros y fucsias se erigen como guardaespaldas en un exclusivo evento al aire libre. Se trata de una celebraci\u00f3n conmemorativa para Yimel Alvarado, quien cre\u00f3 estos vestidos para sus Noches de cabaret en el sal\u00f3n arriba del restaurante, donde ella hac\u00eda playback de baladas de amor. Sus amigos cercanos, la Familia Alvarado, han adornado el escenario con alegres ramos que compensan el gris del pavimento. Recitan el rosario y levantan tragos para brindar. Muchos llevan mascarillas para protegerse de lo que pueda haber en el aire caliente de la noche. Mientras el coronavirus contin\u00faa su propagaci\u00f3n indiscriminada por todo el pa\u00eds, aqu\u00ed en Nueva York ha hecho una inquieta pausa de verano que permite acercarse a algo as\u00ed como la vida normal. Una pausa que ha permitido a la familia y amigos de Yimel reunirse en su honor, aunque sea al aire libre. Pero la gran metr\u00f3poli sigue sacudida por la supremac\u00eda letal del virus; para esta noche, los funcionarios de salud habr\u00e1n contado 18.787 muertes confirmadas. Y ning\u00fan rinc\u00f3n de Nueva York ha sentido su ira m\u00e1s que los barrios entrelazados de Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights y Woodside en Queens. Decenas de miles est\u00e1n sin trabajo. La gente hace largas filas en los bancos de alimentos y tratan de mantener una sana distancia. Muchos son indocumentados, y por lo tanto no son candidatos para recibir los beneficios y han recurrido a la venta ambulante en las aceras: tacos, chicharrones de cerdo, raspadillas, mascarillas. Casi todo el mundo conoce a alguien que ha muerto. En este parche de veinte kil\u00f3metros cuadrados de Queens, cerca de 1400 personas habr\u00e1n muerto por el coronavirus a finales de julio. En solo una escuela primaria en Elmhurst, casi 90 estudiantes ya han perdido a un padre o tutor. La ausencia est\u00e1 en todas partes. En un apartamento lleno de gente en Corona, la familia Lema no llora una muerte, sino dos. D\u00edas despu\u00e9s del servicio f\u00fanebre en Staten Island para Vicenta, la matriarca de la familia, su marido, Jos\u00e9, muri\u00f3 del virus antes de que le informaran sobre la muerte de su esposa. Dos peque\u00f1as urnas que contienen sus cenizas se encuentran sobre una c\u00f3moda astillada en el dormitorio que compart\u00edan. Entre ellas, una estatuilla de la Virgen Mar\u00eda. Su hija Rosa, que est\u00e1 embarazada, planea llevar las urnas a Ecuador. Est\u00e1 esperando el papeleo necesario y el nacimiento de su hijo. En Woodside, Joe Farris contin\u00faa adapt\u00e1ndose a la vida sin su pareja, Jack Wongserat. Durante unas semanas durmi\u00f3 en el sof\u00e1 de la sala, incapaz de entrar en su dormitorio, y mucho menos quitar el sill\u00f3n que los m\u00e9dicos hab\u00edan tirado en la cama cuando atend\u00edan a Jack. Los muchos pares de tenis de Jack todav\u00eda llenan el estante de zapatos cerca de la puerta principal, y las piezas de la vajilla del restaurante que nunca abri\u00f3 se encuentran en una vitrina de cristal. El collar de oro con la figura de Buda que Jack llevaba el d\u00eda de su muerte ocupa un lugar de honor. Pero Joe est\u00e1 logrando avances. Toca m\u00fasica de meditaci\u00f3n budista, practica m\u00e9todos de reducci\u00f3n del estr\u00e9s y duerme en la cama que ya no comparte. Muchos se recuperaron. Algunos experimentaron s\u00edntomas menores. Algunos soportaron lo que parec\u00eda una gripe especialmente mala. Algunos estuvieron tan cerca de morir que durante meses se quedar\u00e1n sin aliento. Despu\u00e9s de que lo dieron de alta del Hospital Elmhurst, Dawa Sherpa pas\u00f3 semanas recuper\u00e1ndose. Ahora, mientras su esposa trabaja, cuida de sus tres hijos \u2014el m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o da volteretas por el apartamento\u2014 y es voluntario en la Asociaci\u00f3n de Sherpas Unidos, preparando paquetes de cuidado para los que a\u00fan lo necesitan. No ha vuelto a conducir para Uber. Shamsul Chowdhury, el funcionario bancario de Banglad\u00e9s que se convirti\u00f3 en taxista en Queens, tambi\u00e9n se ha recuperado, pero su familia no ha salido indemne. Tres parientes murieron y todos los dem\u00e1s miembros de su familia se enfermaron: su esposa, su hija, Mahdia, y sus dos hijos. Muchos de sus colegas taxistas perecieron por el virus, por lo que se habla de un monumento conmemorativo. Pero Shamsul tambi\u00e9n ha dejado de conducir por encargo; pronto tendr\u00e1 un nuevo trabajo en el Servicio Postal de Estados Unidos. Mahdia trabaja ahora como pasante no remunerada para la oficina de un senador estatal \u2014sus tareas incluyen ayudar a los electores a solicitar el seguro de desempleo\u2014 y volver\u00e1 a Cornell en oto\u00f1o. El virus ha provocado otros cambios. El Hospital Elmhurst ha realizado reuniones virtuales para tranquilizar a los residentes y disipar ideas err\u00f3neas. Ha mejorado las formas de proporcionar actualizaciones sobre las condiciones de los pacientes, y ha ayudado a establecer los protocolos cl\u00ednicos para el tratamiento de la covid, forjados en los infernales d\u00edas de marzo. No es que esos d\u00edas est\u00e9n en el olvido. Aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1 hay modestos homenajes: una foto de un mec\u00e1nico muy querido fuera de una tienda de reparaci\u00f3n de bicicletas; una cinta negra en la ventana de una panader\u00eda; la llama temblorosa de una vela votiva. Pero mientras la ciudad anticipa un resurgimiento del virus, uno que alcanzar\u00e1 niveles espantosos a finales del oto\u00f1o, lo que preocupa es si las advertencias han sido atendidas. \u00bfSe habr\u00e1 aprendido la lecci\u00f3n de que la sobrepoblaci\u00f3n ayud\u00f3 a convertir a Queens en el epicentro de la peor pandemia del siglo? Hacia arriba y hacia abajo de la Avenida Roosevelt, volantes pegados a las columnas elevadas del metro anuncian habitaciones reci\u00e9n disponibles en los s\u00f3tanos, en apartamentos subdivididos, en viviendas dentro de viviendas. Revolotean en la brisa de la ciudad. Fuera de El Trio, en esta calurosa y h\u00fameda noche de julio, se han rezado los rosarios, ha actuado una banda de mariachis y se ha colocado una caja negra con las cenizas de Yimel en el escenario de tela roja. Su hermana menor Olivia, el \u00faltimo integrante de la familia que la vio con vida, lleva una camiseta que muestra a Yimel como un \u00e1ngel con un fabuloso vestido rojo. Olivia ha perdido su trabajo en la lavander\u00eda; sus brazos est\u00e1n ahora bronceados por vender agua embotellada en un parque. Llama a su madre, Concepci\u00f3n Alvarado, en M\u00e9xico. Pronto la mujer canosa aparece en la pantalla del celular, junto al altar que ha instalado en honor a Yimel fuera de una casa de bloques de cemento. All\u00ed, en un plato, est\u00e1 el pan dulce favorito de su hija. La madre llora, y se seca las l\u00e1grimas con un trapo. Cuando la tarde azul celeste cede ante la noche cer\u00falea, el dolor cede un poco. Los miembros de la Familia Alvarado desaparecen, solo para volver con vestidos de lentejuelas y caftanes. Elevados por sus zapatos de plataforma, se muestran seductoras y cantan de amor y rebeld\u00eda. Se alzan caballitos de tequila y se bebe mientras la gente estalla en gritos de \u00a1Que viva Yimel!. La celebraci\u00f3n de la vida en un sombr\u00edo estacionamiento en Queens se prolonga mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la medianoche, hacia la esperanza e incertidumbre de otro d\u00eda.

    "article_text": "In Blue States and Red, Pandemic Upends Public Services and Jobs The coronavirus pandemic has inflicted an economic battering on state and local governments, shrinking tax receipts by hundreds of billions of dollars. Now devastating budget cuts loom, threatening to cripple public services and pare work forces far beyond the 1.3 million jobs lost in eight months. Governors, mayors and county executives have pleaded for federal aid before the end of the year. Congressional Republicans have scorned such assistance, with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, calling it a \u201cblue-state bailout.\u201d But it turns out this budget crisis is colorblind. Six of the seven states that are expected to suffer the biggest revenue declines over the next two years are red \u2014 states led by Republican governors and won by President Trump this year, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Analytics. Those on the front lines agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a red-state, blue-state issue,\u201d said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. The National Governors Association\u2019s top officials \u2014 Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican \u2014 issued a statement this fall saying, \u201cThis is a national problem, and it demands a bipartisan and national solution.\u201d Efforts to forge a new stimulus bill gained momentum this week with a $900 billion proposal \u2014 offered by a bipartisan group of legislators and endorsed by Democratic leaders \u2014 that includes $160 billion for state, local and tribal governments. While short of plugging the widening fiscal gaps, such a sum would provide welcome relief. But the Republican leadership shows no sign of coming around on state and local aid. In reality, the degree of financial distress turns less on which party controls a statehouse or a city hall than on the number of Covid-19 cases, the kinds of businesses undergirding a state\u2019s economy, and its tax structure. Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota, Republican-led states that depend on energy-related taxes, have been walloped by the sharp decline in oil prices. Places where tourism provides a large infusion of revenues, like Florida and Nevada, face revenue declines of 10 percent or more, as does Louisiana, which relies on both tourism and energy. Elsewhere, the steep falloff in sales and personal income taxes \u2014 which on average account for roughly two-thirds of a state\u2019s tax revenue, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts \u2014 is forcing Republican and Democratic officials to consider laying off police officers, reducing childhood vaccinations and closing libraries, parks and drug treatment centers. Even the most optimistic assumptions about the course of the pandemic point to fiscal consequences for states and local governments that \u201cwould be the worst since the Great Depression\u201d and take years to dig out of, Dan White, director of fiscal policy research at Moody\u2019s Analytics, concluded. The squeeze at the state level reverberates in urban, suburban and rural counties in nearly every corner of the United States, and officials are making piercing choices. In Casper, Wyo., someone from the district attorney\u2019s office walks around the block to the Circuit Court building each week and fetches a large plastic garbage bag full of discarded paper clips to reuse. The brief journey is just one way that the prosecutor, Dan Itzen, is cutting costs. He has also stopped prosecuting 17 types of misdemeanors \u2014 including assault and battery, first-time drunken driving, shoplifting, check fraud and property damage. \u201cSomething had to give,\u201d said Mr. Itzen, who handles about one-third of Wyoming\u2019s criminal caseload and gets his funding from the state. \u201cIf I\u2019m losing personnel, I cannot continue to prosecute as many cases.\u201d In Kansas City, Mo., with a municipal budget of $1.7 billion, the city manager has asked each department to draft a plan for cuts of more than 11 percent. That could mean laying off 200 police officers from the 1,300-member force and 180 firefighters and emergency medical technicians, said Dan Fowler, a City Council member. \u201cThis is one of the things that keeps me up at night,\u201d Mr. Fowler said, thinking about the impact on the city\u2019s half a million residents. Such cuts could end up closing one or two police stations, even though crime is rising, he said. Emergency response times are already slow, Mr. Fowler said, so even though he lives near a hospital, \u201cif I have a heart attack, I\u2019ll just crawl over there.\u201d From collecting garbage to issuing building permits, maintaining parks to fixing potholes, \u201ceverything\u2019s going to slow down because we\u2019re not going to have the people to do it,\u201d he explained. A traffic study of a street in his district with a heavy accident toll has been delayed. In New Orleans, Democratic city leaders are going through a similarly painful process, shrinking next fiscal year\u2019s general fund by $92 million, down to $634 million. To avoid layoffs, the city is cutting the pay of higher-level employees by 10 percent and requiring most other employees, including police officers, firefighters and emergency responders, to take 26 unpaid furlough days \u2014 one every two weeks \u2014 next year. The move amounts to a 10 percent pay cut, and comes on top of six furlough days imposed on the city\u2019s roughly 4,000 employees through the end of this year. On any given day, that will mean fewer people available to drive buses, respond to emergency calls or pick up trash. \u201cWe are at the marrow,\u201d said Gilbert Monta\u00f1o, the city\u2019s chief administrative officer. Every agency on average took a 21 percent cut on top of what they were already facing. New Orleans, like most cities and localities, spends the bulk of its budget on its employees, which makes it nearly impossible to reduce spending without reducing the hours that people work.

For women and Black workers, in particular, the public sector has historically offered more opportunities than the private sector for a stable income and reliable benefits. \u201cThese are folks that are providing essential public services every single day, risking their lives,\u201d said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, \u201cand now there\u2019s a good possibility that many are going to be faced with a pink slip.\u201d So far, an overwhelming majority of state and local job losses have been in education. Though many of the layoffs have been characterized as temporary, educators and parents worry that they could become permanent. In a new survey of mayors, 45 percent said they expected \u201cdramatic\u201d cuts for their school budgets. Public schools overwhelmingly rely on property taxes. States often provide additional funding, but many have cut their education budgets. Most states managed to hobble along until the summer, a typical endpoint to the fiscal year. There had been strong growth before the pandemic struck in March, and the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which Congress passed in early spring, kept many households afloat. In spots, the extra federal money could be used to cover some state and local pandemic-related expenses in health care and education. Both of those cushions are fading. In most places, the 2020-21 fiscal year will play out in the shadow of the pandemic and a stumbling economy. And federal emergency money for extended unemployment benefits that has helped families meet housing and food expenses expires at the end of December, putting even greater demand on public services. Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and many economists have warned that reducing state and local spending will further drag down a weak recovery, as it did after the Great Recession. Spending by state and local governments accounted for about 15 percent of the nation\u2019s economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the Commerce Department. While the federal government can run budget deficits to cover both regular and unexpected expenses, states generally cannot. In Wyoming, Mark Gordon, the Republican governor, acknowledged the fallout on the economy after announcing a new round of cuts for the coming fiscal year. He said 160 private-sector jobs depended on every 100 state employees, who spend money on haircuts, children's sports and restaurants. Although Wyoming is facing one of the worst budget shocks, it also has one of the biggest rainy-day funds, which states built up after the last recession to help weather downturns. Several states \u2014 including Louisiana, Nevada, New York and Illinois \u2014 have little or nothing left in reserve. Even so, Wyoming\u2019s governor has said he doesn\u2019t want to burn through the state\u2019s safety net with years of hard times potentially lying ahead. The fund may also be needed to plug an additional $300 million deficit related to the state\u2019s public schools. So Mr. Gordon has proposed cutting programs dealing with childhood vaccinations, substance abuse and mental health. Meg Wiehe, deputy executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said Wyoming at least was dealing with the painful reality. \u201cThe bigger kind of cuts that will resonate with people are all going to come to a head in the early part of next year,\u201d Ms. Wiehe said. \u201cWe\u2019re staring down some deep and very devastating cuts.\u201d",

    "article_text": "U.S. employers added 245,000 jobs in November, a fifth month of tapering, amid a coronavirus surge. The American economic recovery continues to slow, stranding millions who have yet to find a new job after being thrown out of work by the coronavirus pandemic. The latest evidence came Friday when the Labor Department reported that employers added 245,000 jobs in November, the fifth month in a row that the pace of hiring has tapered off. The figure for October was revised downward to 610,000, from the initially stated 638,000. The unemployment rate in November was 6.7 percent, down from the previous month\u2019s rate of 6.9 percent. But that figure does not fully capture the extent of the joblessness because it doesn\u2019t include people who have dropped out of the labor force and are not actively searching for work. November\u2019s job totals were dragged down in part by the loss of 93,000 temporary census workers who are no longer needed now that the official counting has wound down. More than half those knocked out of a job early in the pandemic have been rehired, but there are still roughly 10 million fewer jobs than there were in February. Many people in that group are weeks away from losing their unemployment benefits, as the emergency assistance approved by Congress last spring is set to expire at the end of the year. \u201cWe\u2019re in an unusual position right now in the economy,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at the accounting firm Evercore ISI. \u201cFar off in the distance there is sunlight\u201d because of progress on a vaccine, he said, but until then, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a few of the toughest months of this pandemic, and there will be a lot of scars left to heal.\u201d Covid-19 caseloads have doubled in the past month, leading to new restrictions and tamping down shopping and other commerce. In much of the country, colder weather is likely to discourage outdoor dining, which many restaurants have depended on. And Congress has been unable to agree on a new spending package to help struggling businesses and households. ",

    "article_text": "Which New Yorkers Will Be First to Get the Virus Vaccine? Health care workers. Essential workers. Nursing home residents. New Yorkers who live in the hardest-hit neighborhoods. These are among the different groups that the public health authorities in New York want to prioritize for coronavirus vaccination. On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that the state would receive its first batch of the vaccine \u2014 170,000 doses from the drug maker Pfizer \u2014 on Dec. 15, pending federal approval. New York City anticipates receiving around 480,000 doses by the beginning of January, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday. Bill Neidhardt, the spokesman, said about roughly half would be Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and half would be from Moderna, another drug maker. Mr. Cuomo said he was unsure when the vaccine would be widely available. The uncertainty surrounding availability will be just one element of what is shaping up to be the greatest mass vaccination campaign in the United States in at least the last half century. Pfizer has said it expects to have produced about 25 million doses for the American market by the end of the year, while Moderna has said it expects to produce more than 20 million doses. A total of 45 million doses would be enough for 22.5 million people, since each person requires two doses, separated by a few weeks. Mr. Cuomo said the first batch from Moderna should arrive later this month. Both companies still need F.D.A. approval. The federal government has said the initial doses will be distributed to states based on the size of their adult population.  While the C.D.C. will offer a broad framework for which groups to prioritize, there is considerable room for New York State and New York City to make their own decisions. Hospitals are already preparing to receive their first shipments, even if they don\u2019t know how many doses they will get. Northwell Health, the state\u2019s largest hospital system, was told it would receive 48 hours\u2019 notice before its first allotment of the Pfizer vaccine shipped from a distribution center in Michigan, according to Onisis Stefas, the hospital system\u2019s chief pharmacy officer. The vaccine would arrive in a suitcase-sized box, packed with dry ice. Inside, a smaller box would contain the frozen vaccine vials. There was so much uncertainty that Dr. Stefas said he was unsure whether to use those doses quickly, or reserve half to use as the second dose. An advisory committee to the C.D.C. on Tuesday recommended that the first people to receive the vaccine should be health care workers, along with nursing home residents and staff. Mr. Neidhardt, the spokesman for the mayor, said the 480,000 expected doses would be given to health care personnel performing high-risk activities, like working on coronavirus floors at hospitals, and people living and working in nursing homes.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to protect health care workers so they can continue to go to work and take care of the sick,\u201d said Jessica Justman, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. Nursing home residents are being prioritized for a different reason: They are at high risk of dying from the coronavirus. Residents and staff of long-term care facilities account for about 40 percent of the deaths attributed to the virus in the United States. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo and his aides said the first shipments of the vaccine would go to nursing home residents and staff, as well as frontline health care workers. (A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and initial shipments of the Moderna vaccine would arrive later in December, the governor\u2019s office said.) There are about 85,000 residents of nursing homes, according to the governor\u2019s office, and the state has told the C.D.C. that there are more than \u201c800,000 critical health care workers.\u201d That includes home health care aides and staff members in hospitals, nursing homes and ambulance companies. In all, that is more than 4 percent of the state\u2019s population. There is likely some overlap between the 480,000 doses New York City expects to receive and the 170,000 doses Mr. Cuomo described Wednesday. Getting through the high-priority groups could take some time, experts said. Hospitals are already deciding which employees are eligible to be vaccinated once the first shipments come in.  Mount Sinai Health System, for example, will include some janitors and food delivery personnel who work in the emergency department and intensive care units among the health care workers slated to receive some of the earliest doses, said Susan Mashni, the chief pharmacy officer of the system. New York State has told the C.D.C. that the next groups to be \u201ctargeted\u201d for the vaccine will be \u201cother frontline essential workers, medically high risk individuals and individuals over 65.\u201d In a draft plan that the state released publicly in October, more than a dozen categories of people were put in one of five priority groups. Grocery store workers were ahead of \u201cindividuals under 65 with high-risk comorbidities,\u201d who were in turn ahead of certain groups of essential workers. Mr. Cuomo has also been expressing concern that low-income and minority areas could be underserved by the vaccines, a point he reiterated on Wednesday, saying the federal vaccination plan \u201coverlooks the Black, brown, and poor communities.\u201d A draft plan that New York City filed with the C.D.C. raised the possibility that race would factor into the city\u2019s vaccination plans. Black and Hispanic New Yorkers have died of the virus at a disproportionate rate. The draft stated that \u201cvaccine planning and allocation decisions must be made through an anti-racist and intersectional lens.\u201d What that means in practice remains unclear. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would prioritize vaccination for residents of some 27 neighborhoods that had been disproportionately hard hit in the spring. Many of those neighborhoods have predominately Black or Hispanic residents, one city official said. But the official added that the plans largely depended on how much of the vaccine the city received in the coming months. In the past, the city has released lists of neighborhoods it has deemed particularly hard-hit. These priority categories encompass millions of people across the state. But it is unclear when the vaccine will be widely available for everyone. By early next year, Pfizer and Moderna may be able to ship about 70 million doses a month, a top federal vaccine official told The Washington Post. Other vaccines may also be approved by then. It\u2019s possible that Americans who don\u2019t fit any specialized category may be receiving vaccines in the spring. There is so much uncertainty, and some of that is unavoidable. But there is also a growing sense that the authorities could be providing a clearer picture of what to expect. \u201cWhatever the plan is, it hasn\u2019t been shared really with the public,\u201d said James Krellenstein, an H.I.V. activist and an organizer of a coalition of health care workers and advocates called the Covid-19 Working Group-New York. He worried that the confusion and lack of information would contribute to \u201cpeople not feeling they\u2019re getting their fair place in the line.\u201d The city\u2019s provisional plans call for relying in part on the existing vaccine distribution infrastructure, which includes doctor\u2019s offices and pharmacies. That means many New Yorkers might be getting their Covid-19 vaccine at the nearest CVS. That posed a potential problem: Asking people to wait at the pharmacy counter could lead to more transmission. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people crowding indoors together,\u201d Professor Justman said, noting that outdoor vaccination sites made a lot of sense in this pandemic. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at very low temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius. Hospital systems have been buying new ultracold freezers in preparation and locating existing ones in their research labs.  And they have started to prepare for what to do the minute their first shipments arrive. \u201cWe\u2019re told we have a minute to unload it from the special box to the freezer,\u201d said Dr. Mashni. Already, the city\u2019s Health Department is asking hospitals to regularly report the temperatures in their ultracold freezers to make sure they can maintain temperatures at least as cold as minus 70 degrees indefinitely. But the vaccination can be kept at more ordinary temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius during the five days leading up to its use, according to Pfizer. The demanding cold-storage requirements for the Pfizer vaccine may lead it to be largely steered toward cities early on, further determining who ends up getting that vaccine in New York. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably going to make sense that the Moderna vaccine goes to rural areas, and that the Pfizer vaccine is directed to large institutions,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Farber, an infectious disease expert at Northwell Health and a member of a state task force that will review the vaccines.",

    "article_text": "The Winds Have Shifted in Pandemic Aid Negotiations WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory and faster-than-expected breakthroughs on a coronavirus vaccine have shifted the dynamics of stimulus talks in Congress, leading to the first serious bipartisan negotiations in months and empowering rank-and-file lawmakers who have long agitated for a compromise. With many cities and states reinstating lockdowns and the pace of job creation slowing, congressional lawmakers and Mr. Biden are facing pressure to provide a financial lifeline to the economy until a widespread vaccine forces the virus into submission. Mr. Biden has used public appearances in recent days to encourage lawmakers to compromise on a quick aid package that he said would only be a \u201cdown payment\u201d on what the incoming administration believes is necessary to mitigate the nation\u2019s economic pain in the months ahead. His team has pushed for Democrats to move off their hard-line negotiating stance for a trillion-dollar-plus bill, a stance that had made discussions with Republicans a nonstarter, and to embrace a smaller, bipartisan proposal. \u201cI think it should be passed,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the $908 billion proposal in a CNN interview broadcast Thursday evening, though he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask for more help when we get there to get things done.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced such a shift on Wednesday, throwing their support behind a bipartisan $908 billion outline as a baseline for restarting negotiations. The plan, which rank-and-file lawmakers are still finalizing, would provide aid through March, offering a new wave of aid to small businesses and the unemployed, helping state and local governments and temporarily shielding businesses from some lawsuits amid the pandemic. In a sign of momentum, more Republicans also began coalescing around the $908 billion framework as a baseline for restarting negotiations, which had collapsed over disagreements about size and scope. On Thursday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, spoke for the first time since the November election about another relief package, along with the spending bills needed to avert a government shutdown on Dec. 11. Mr. McConnell later told reporters that he and Ms. Pelosi are \u201cboth interested in getting an outcome\u201d on the two issues. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more hopeful that we\u2019ll get a bill,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He told reporters that he supported the bipartisan framework and that he had discussed coronavirus relief with President Trump at the White House on Thursday. But he added a dose of skepticism, given Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to circulate a blueprint for a smaller relief package. \u201cI will support what Senator McConnell wants to propose,\u201d Mr. Graham said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have any Democratic support. I\u2019m tired of doing show votes here.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, along with Democrats on Capitol Hill, have become alarmed at the possibility that the economy could slip back into recession in the new year, as small businesses shutter and government benefits expire for millions of workers, handing him an even bigger economic challenge. But Mr. Biden is walking a delicate path in moving toward a possible compromise. He has called publicly for an immediate deal to provide more economic aid, even before he becomes president, and spoken favorably about the bipartisan framework. But he has not directly injected himself into talks between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell, as some lawmakers and aides stressed that any immediate deal would need Mr. Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 not Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cThe president-elect has been very clear in stating that something needs to happen, that the American people need relief,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia and one of several House lawmakers who have worked on compromise legislation in an effort to break through the impasse. When asked if Mr. Biden should be more involved, she said she believed it better for Mr. Biden to play a supporting role while Mr. Trump remained president. \u201cHe will not be president until Jan. 20 \u2014 we can\u2019t wait until Jan. 20,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. He\u2019s not yet the president.\u201d The question of whether Mr. Trump would support a final compromise remains a wild card. Asked Thursday whether he agreed with Mr. McConnell that pandemic relief was \u201cin sight\u201d and whether he would support \u201cthis bill,\u201d Mr. Trump answered affirmatively. \u201cI will, and I think we are getting very close,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. While it was initially unclear which bill Mr. Trump was willing to sign, the White House later clarified that it was the outline of the smaller Republican bill, which Mr. McConnell is backing. Unlike in the fall, when both Republicans and Democrats had political incentives not to cut a deal, statements by Mr. Biden and his congressional allies in recent days show that lawmakers now see compromise as in their best interests. Depending on the outcome, stimulus plans could become a key issue in the Georgia runoff elections that will decide Senate control in January. Even with the renewed movement, a deal is far from assured. Mr. McConnell, who has continuously criticized the Democrats as wanting too expensive a package, acknowledged that it had been \u201cheartening to see a few hopeful signs\u201d this week in negotiations. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of endorsing the compromise plan in remarks on Thursday, admonishing lawmakers to focus on policy provisions where there was substantial agreement and signaling that he would not be quick to move off his targeted proposal. Even as he declared \u201ccompromise is within reach,\u201d he did not explicitly comment on the bipartisan framework. It also remains unclear what top Democrats would insist on in any final bill. But lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill acknowledged that a devastating spike in coronavirus cases across the country helped fuel momentum behind the discussions. Even a smaller, more immediate deal would fund an imminent distribution of a vaccine \u2014 a prospect that emerged after the election \u2014 and leave open the possibility for another relief package under a Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of the logistical costs and difficulties of vaccine distribution and the dramatic spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths every day,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, a longtime close ally of Mr. Biden\u2019s who is involved in the discussions. \u201cIt is clear, to everyone I think, that we are in for a very hard winter before the vaccine is broadly available.\u201d Discussions toward a possible deal began among a loose bipartisan group of senators in mid-November, according to four officials familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks who requested anonymity to describe them. The participants agreed to meet over dinner at the Capitol Hill home of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Nov. 17, two weeks after Election Day, to see if they could cobble together a plan. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, picked up the tab for food and drinks from San Lorenzo, a favorite of Washington\u2019s political class for Tuscan food. Fresh off a come-from-behind victory in Maine, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, agreed to co-host. They were joined by three more Senate Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the party\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 as well as two more Senate Republicans, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah. The conversation was productive enough that it quickly spilled into a nearly daily series of Zoom sessions that continued \u2014 sometimes for hours at a time \u2014 through the Thanksgiving holiday. Pleased at their progress, senators involved dryly dubbed themselves \u201cthe dinner group.\u201d Party leadership was kept informed, but senators did most of the negotiating themselves. Despite his more junior Senate status, Mr. Romney, his party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emerged early on as a driver of the talks with Mr. Warner. He insisted that Republicans could go no higher than roughly $900 billion in new spending \u2014 a number that Ms. Collins floated as a possible compromise figure \u2014 and that liability protections for employers would have to be included in some form. The proposal was made final Monday night over a pizza dinner hosted by Mr. Romney in an oversize hearing room. It would provide $300 a week in additional benefits to the unemployed for 18 weeks, after a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapsed in July. It includes $288 billion for struggling small businesses, restaurants and theaters and $160 billion for strapped cities and states, and most likely will include some liability protections for businesses. The framework, unveiled Tuesday, quickly received a boost from Mr. Biden. And speaking Thursday on CNN, he noted that he had faith in Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Coons to resolve the impasse, adding that he was \u201crelying on their judgment\u201d in determining \u201cthe most basic things that are needed now.\u201d Luke Broadwater, Thomas Kaplan and Michael D.

    "article_text": "A Covid-Free Cruise Takes Planning, but the Strip Show Goes On ABOARD THE WORLD DREAM, IN THE STRAIT OF MALACCA \u2014 The drinks were virgin and the distancing was social when the Dream Boys strippers stormed the stage. Masks at poolside were mandatory. Hand sanitizer stations stood within easy reach of the slot machines. And in a vision of the future of the global cruise industry, passengers aboard the World Dream cruise liner wore small pink contact-tracing pods that monitored their locations and recorded the names of everybody they met with. \u201cWe aboard the World Dream are doing our utmost to keep your cruise with us healthy,\u201d Robert Bodin, the ship\u2019s captain, told his 1,400 passengers as they set sail, in a departure from his usual invitation to relax and enjoy the journey. The World Dream departs from Singapore two or three times a week on a cruise to nowhere, a rare beacon of hope for an industry under mortal threat. In February, the world watched in horror as the coronavirus infected more than 200 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, trapping its 3,600 passengers and crew. Governments banned cruises, crews were sent home, and passengers canceled their bookings, idling an industry that employed more than one million people. Singapore, along with several countries in Europe as well as Japan, has extended the cruise business a lifeline. As many ships sit idle around the world, the city-state has encouraged voyages on a limited and highly controlled basis. To find out how this was possible, I booked a three-day voyage on the World Dream. Friends and colleagues wondered why I would want to go on what some of them called \u201ca floating petri dish.\u201d Their fears weren\u2019t baseless. U.S. health officials suggest people avoid cruise ships and have said operators must set out a framework for how cruising could restart. Most major cruise lines in the United States have announced that they will not resume operations until 2021. A week before I set sail, a Caribbean liner from Barbados was forced to turn back after five people tested positive for the coronavirus. I contacted infectious-disease experts to ask about the risks. \u201cWhen I first saw your email, I thought: \u2018Bad idea,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Edward Ryan, director of global infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. Still, he and others told me that Singapore\u2019s restrictions made cruises look safe. \u201cWhen I look at what they are doing,\u201d Dr. Ryan said, \u201cthey are effectively creating a reasonable bubble.\u201d Demand is still there. Genting Cruise Lines, the World Dream\u2019s operator, said it had received 6,000 bookings within five days. Bookings for Royal Caribbean, which is preparing to sail from Singapore this month, were six times higher than the company would normally get in October, the cruise line said. The World Dream offers just about everything it did before the coronavirus struck, said Genting, including a zip line, two pools, a casino, 11 restaurants and cafes, and various shows. Only the karaoke room was closed, per Singaporean government guidelines. Singapore requires passengers take a coronavirus test before boarding. Instead of Hong Kong, Okinawa or another sunny destination, the ship would dock nowhere but Singapore. Capacity has been slashed in half, to a limit of 1,700 guests. Following Singapore\u2019s guidelines, the cruise lines upgraded their air filters and enforced social distancing. They required passengers to carry the contact tracing devices, which link to Singaporean monitoring systems. They staged drills for what to do if a passenger showed symptoms: test, contact-trace, isolate any infected people, tell passengers to return to their cabins and sail home. Royal Caribbean plans to buy Covid-19 insurance for each passenger that will cover costs of up to $19,000 if the guest is infected, said Angie Stephen, the line\u2019s Asia-Pacific managing director. The measures drove costs about 40 percent higher, said Michael Goh, Genting Cruise Lines\u2019 head of international sales, at a news conference. But they make cruising \u201cone of the safest holidays at this point in time,\u201d he said. Genting is playing up its health efforts. \u201cCruise with confidence,\u201d says the World Dream\u2019s website, which highlights the ventilation systems (\u201c100 percent external fresh air\u201d) and food hygiene practices. (\u201cSelf-service at buffet restaurants will be suspended.\u201d) Regina Setar, 38, a part-time security guard, said she studied the measures before accompanying her 70-year-old mother on board. Her mother has diabetes and recently had knee surgery but has been \u201ccooped up at home, watching all the news about Covid.\u201d They paid about $300 for a balcony room. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any risks,\u201d Ms. Setar said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to. My father would kill me if anything happened.\u201d Probably the biggest reason I felt safe on the cruise was that, when I boarded the ship, Singapore had gone seven straight days without any coronavirus cases. I had to take a rapid antigen test, administered by a medical worker gently flicking a short swab around my nostrils. It was not as invasive as the long swabs used for what are known as PCR tests, the standard way of detecting the coronavirus. Antigen tests are easy to administer to large groups of people, but experts warn that they may not catch everyone who is infected. So Genting takes other steps. Following Singapore\u2019s rules, it has dispatched 40 \u201ccruise ambassadors\u201d in dark blue polo shirts to ensure guests keep their distance from one another. You get accustomed to hearing them say, \u201cPlease stand one meter apart.\u201d Almost all passengers comply, \u201cbut there\u2019s always that 1 percent,\u201d said Zulkifli bin Ibrahim, a cruise ambassador. One passenger, Mr. Zulkifli said, shouted at him after he reminded the passenger to wear a mask after swimming. Meals test the spacing limits. Guests stood on stickers three feet apart, making for long lines at the buffet areas. They called out their food choices to the chefs, who used gloves and tongs as they filled plates. At one dinner, an elderly woman, her mask pulled down below her chin, was peering at the offerings at the buffet table. A cruise ambassador approached her with a frantic: \u201cAuntie, auntie! Your mask!\u201d The casino was a major draw. Dozens of gray-haired passengers sat at the rows of slot machines, also three feet apart. There were several tables for mahjong. A group of elderly women, wearing masks, shuffled tiles. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only one worried about the risks. A cough would make me wonder whether the woman two tables down from me was a germ vector. Still, the passengers seemed grateful for the chance to go somewhere else for the first time since the outbreak, even if \u201csomewhere else\u201d was a cruise ship sailing in the middle of the water. \u201cIt\u2019s been ages since I traveled!\u201d said Doris Yeo, a sales assistant and a cruise aficionado, who was laughing with nine other people, mostly family, spread across two restaurant tables. Her relatives joined, she said, because \u201cthey really like gambling.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s everything under one roof,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just perfect.\u201d The next day, I slipped into the theater for the \u201cVerry Christmas\u201d show, an acrobatic performance with a Christmas theme. A drag queen wearing a blond wig, a fur stole and a sequined dress sang \u201cSanta Baby\u201d to a group of Santa Clauses. The masked audience hooted and hollered. The last night of the cruise, I attended the Dream Boys male burlesque show in a Chinese restaurant. It was billed as a \u201cladies night where your fantasies really will come to life.\u201d The room appeared full, even as the audience sat at least three feet apart at a series of round tables. Because the show began after 10:30 p.m., no alcohol was served, per Singapore\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions. The dancers\u2019 routines \u2014 a military display with presumably fake weaponry, and another performance with captain\u2019s hats and not much else \u2014 were met with catcalls, barely muffled even by masks. At the curtain call, the audience was clapping and cheering, with one woman shouting, \u201cEncore!\u201d Fun and relaxation take some planning on a Covid-19 cruise. Shows must be booked in advance. Swimmers must do the same \u2014 the main pool allows 26 swimmers at a time, and they can swim for only an hour. With a bit of planning, Raymond Lim and his wife managed to swim, hit the Jacuzzi and take ballroom and line-dancing classes. (\u201cQuite fun.\u201d) He also took a class on how to paint on pebbles. (\u201cA bit lame.\u201d) Mr. Lim, who works for the Singapore Tourism Board, called it a \u201cgood break\u201d but \u201ca muted cruise experience.\u201d Compared with his past cruises, he said later, he couldn\u2019t find a lounge to chill out, and there was \u201cno spontaneous dance.\u201d \u201cOver all,\u201d Mr. Lim said, \u201cyou don\u2019t really get to loosen up.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Jazz Standard Is Silenced by the Pandemic. More Clubs May Follow. The New York jazz scene was dealt a blow this week when the Jazz Standard, a noted club on East 27th Street in Manhattan, announced it was closing its doors because of the pandemic. The 130-seat, subterranean Jazz Standard, which opened in 1997 and then started over five years later as part of Blue Smoke Flatiron, a barbecue restaurant by Danny Meyer, is New York\u2019s first major jazz club to close down as the coronavirus outbreak has meant many months of lost business. But music venues throughout the city say they are hanging by a thread after being shuttered for nearly nine months, with scant revenue or government relief. \u201cWe have explored every avenue to arrive at a different outcome,\u201d Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns the club and restaurant, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cBut due to the pandemic and months without revenue \u2014 as well as a lengthy rent negotiation that has come to a standstill \u2014 we\u2019ve reached the disappointing conclusion that there is no alternative but to close Blue Smoke Flatiron and Jazz Standard.\u201d Also this week, Arlene\u2019s Grocery, a rock standby on the Lower East Side known for its packed nightly lineups of unknown bands \u2014 some of whom did not stay unknown for long, like the Strokes \u2014 said it was \u201con life support,\u201d and that without aid it would close on Feb. 1. The club started a GoFundMe crowdfunding page, which by Thursday had raised $25,000. The pandemic has been brutal for music venues around the country. With few exceptions, they have been unable to put on shows and, unlike restaurants and bars, have received little consideration in the reopening plans of most state governments. A federal bill, the Heroes Act, had earmarked $10 billion in relief for music venues and other live-music businesses, but the bill stalled in Congress this fall as larger talks over government relief broke down. According to a recent survey by the New York Independent Venue Association, 68 of its members have accrued $20 million in debt as a result of the pandemic, and they need more than $5 million in monthly relief. \u201cEvery independent venue in New York is in danger of going under at this point,\u201d Jen Lyons, the co-chair of the venue association, said in a statement. \u201cNo one at all has helped us. The feds haven\u2019t come to the table. The state hasn\u2019t come to the table. We\u2019ve been small businesses in our communities for decades. We need help, and no one has helped us.\u201d Since its reopening 18 years ago, the Jazz Standard has been a favorite among jazz fans, tourists and foodies, with residencies by big names and regular engagements like a Monday night show by the Mingus Big Band. Maria Schneider, a Grammy-winning jazz composer, had an annual series during Thanksgiving weekend showcasing her latest work; this year, Ms. Schneider took the event online. The pandemic shutdown has been particularly challenging for jazz, which relies on the network of live performance venues in major cities like New York. In August, Twins Jazz in Washington, the last full-on jazz club on the city\u2019s U Street corridor, shut down. Jazz clubs, like most music venues, have struggled to find ways to stay alive and keep busy during the pandemic, turning to live streams and focusing on food service. Some offer \u201cincidental\u201d music performances \u2014 an accommodation to a rule by the New York State Liquor Authority that allows restaurants and bars to offer some music to customers as they eat. The Jazz Standard, which has been shut since the pandemic hit, said it would continue to offer virtual performances like the Facebook Live series it presents in conjunction with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. And it left open that the possibility the club could reopen. \u201cWe are dedicated to exploring our options in New York City,\u201d said Seth Abramson, the club\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe look forward to writing the next chapter of Jazz Standard. This is not goodbye.\u201d",

    "article_text": "California Will Impose Its Strongest Virus Measures Since the Spring LOS ANGELES \u2014 California, the first state to impose far-reaching lockdowns because of the coronavirus, announced on Thursday its strictest new measures since the earliest days of the pandemic in an effort to keep a surge in cases from overwhelming hospitals. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the new round of regional stay-at-home orders would take effect as intensive-care beds filled up. Millions of people across Southern and Central California are likely to see outdoor dining shuttered, playgrounds roped off and hair salons closed within days if the available intensive-care capacity in their areas dips below a 15 percent threshold. The new restrictions will last for at least three weeks, strictly limit store capacity and allow restaurants to serve only takeout or delivery. The governor also said people should temporarily call off all nonessential travel. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now our hospital system will be overwhelmed,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act now we\u2019ll continue to see our death rate climb.\u201d The state\u2019s new orders feel eerily like the spring, when spiraling deaths compelled leaders in California, New York and elsewhere to start telling people to stay home. Only now things are even worse. More than 2,750 Americans died of the coronavirus on Thursday, and another 100,000 were in hospitals. Case counts continue to skyrocket. Many states are considering fresh restrictions on business and in some cases urging residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In anticipation of a deadly holiday season, Gov. John Carney of Delaware on Thursday issued a stay-at-home advisory asking people not to gather indoors with anyone outside their household. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently ordered a three-week shutdown that closed casinos and movie theaters and suspended in-person high school and college classes. Oregon, Washington State, Minnesota and cities from Los Angeles to Philadelphia have also reimposed restrictions. In an interview with CNN on Thursday, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said that on his first day as president, he would ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days. \u201cJust 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. And I think we\u2019ll see a significant reduction,\u201d he said. He also said he had asked Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, to play a central role in his administration to help combat the virus. But for now, the states are leading on enforcement, and many of their measures come with pages of exceptions and fine print, as well as uncertainties about how aggressively they will be enforced. Many people are weary after nine months of shifting rules about whether they can go to school, eat indoors or outdoors, take their children to the playground or step inside a big-box store. As he did repeatedly earlier this year, Mr. Newsom emphasized that California would withhold funding from counties that refused to enforce the new stay-at-home order. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be punitive but we wanted to be firm,\u201d he said. That approach, however, has drawn criticism in the past, as it resulted in piecemeal compliance with restrictions. [Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.] By many measures, the situation across California is even bleaker than in March, when Mr. Newsom and other state leaders appeared, unmasked, inside the state\u2019s emergency operations center in Sacramento to order residents to stay home. California has now recorded 1.2 million virus cases and 19,468 deaths, and on Thursday, Mr. Newsom delivered a grim tally via remote video. California is seeing its sharpest increase in cases since the pandemic took hold even as its coronavirus prevention measures have become more stringent; some early measures, such as mask wearing, were voluntary. If hospitalization rates keep soaring, California\u2019s 40 million residents could all be under new stay-at-home orders by Christmas. State leaders have called their new orders \u201cdial-backs\u201d or \u201cfreezes,\u201d and set time limits on the new restrictions in the hopes of flattening yet another steep curve until a vaccine is widely available. But there have been new waves of pushback. Restaurants and some cities within Los Angeles County revolted against new prohibitions on outdoor dining, saying the rules would choke off business and were not grounded in scientific data. Pasadena decided to continue to allow limited outdoor dining and the Beverly Hills City Council unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the county repeal the restrictions. In Michigan, a Republican lawmaker called for the impeachment of Governor Whitmer, a Democrat, after she announced the latest round of restrictions there. Four Republican legislators in Ohio filed articles of impeachment this week against their Republican governor, Mike DeWine, over limits he put into place. Harmeet K. Dhillon, a civil rights lawyer and a member of the Republican National Committee, said many Californians were no longer inclined to listen to state directives because with each wave of the virus the government has prematurely warned that hospitals would be overwhelmed. \u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is a boy-who-cried-wolf situation,\u201d Ms. Dhillon said. \u201cPeople are going to say, \u2018He said the hospitals would fill up in March and they didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Californians, she said, have also become cynical about directives when numerous leaders have been spotted at restaurants even as they implore residents not to go. The question of whether governments should actually enforce social distancing rules and mask orders poses a vexing, divisive challenge across the country. Some police departments have declined to enforce mask mandates or social distancing rules, and mayors and governors have tried to use the rules as a stick to get businesses and residents to cooperate. Faced with a cluster of cases in a suburb of New York City in early March, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo established a \u201ccontainment area\u201d and moved in the National Guard. The approach, shocking at the time, jolted many into paying attention to the virus, which had at that point appeared in very few places. But the strategy primarily focused on closing large gathering spaces, such as schools and houses of worship, and the Guard was not there to enforce boundaries but rather to distribute food to quarantined residents. The virus continued to spread elsewhere in the state. In Colorado, a battle over enforcing the rules has erupted between Democratic leaders and Weld County, a staunchly conservative area on the state\u2019s northern border. Surging cases recently tipped Weld County into the red zone on Colorado\u2019s coronavirus alert system, triggering new restrictions on indoor dining and other businesses. As state lawmakers threatened to cut off relief money, Weld County commissioners have remained defiant, saying they would rely on people\u2019s \u201cindividual responsibility\u201d and not impose any restrictions. Brandon Bird said his pizza place in the county, the Bulldog Pub and Grub, got caught in the middle. He said he continued to allow indoor dining under the county guidelines until state investigators suspended his liquor license the day before Thanksgiving. Mr. Bird has since shifted to takeout only, and said he was frustrated by the whipsawing rules. \u201cWhere\u2019s the consistency?\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what to do correctly and don\u2019t have a bunch of conflicting information.\u201d As California\u2019s reopening led to a summer surge of the virus, some counties openly resisted putting into place prevention measures, prompting the governor to establish an enforcement task force just before the Fourth of July. Through November the task force levied more than $2 million in fines to businesses and carried out 4,366 enforcement actions, including 179 citations and three revocations of business licenses. The other actions were mainly warnings. In addition, counties have sued churches and schools for violating coronavirus orders. Fresno County obtained a preliminary injunction against a Christian school, Immanuel, for returning to in-person classes in August in violation of state orders. Both Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties obtained court orders against churches for defying health orders. The state restrictions limiting attendance at religious services had been upheld by a federal judge, but on Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court vacated his ruling and asked him to reconsider in light of its recent decision to end restrictions on houses of worship in New York. In Las Cruces, N.M., the rhythms of daily life revealed how America\u2019s lockdowns often look punitive on paper but are looser in practice. In the middle of a two-week shutdown ordered by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Las Cruces was not so much on pause as it was on mute. The highways were jammed. Restaurants were banned from serving meals on-site, but a line of cars idled through the drive-through of a Whataburger. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Mayor Ken Miyagishima said. \u201cIf you look at the history of America, they left England because they didn\u2019t really want to be told what to do. I think that\u2019s in the fiber of Americans.\u201d Even government officials are under fire for failing to self-enforce their own rules. Mr. Newsom and the mayor of San Francisco faced widespread criticism after they were spotted at the upscale French Laundry restaurant for separate events. The mayor of Denver had to apologize for flying to Mississippi to spend Thanksgiving with family. In Texas, the top elected official in Williamson County, Judge Bill Gravell Jr., had issued a series of orders that put the county under a \u201cStay Home Stay Safe\u201d lockdown throughout April. Community gatherings of 10 people or more were prohibited. But Mr. Gravell was spotted during the shutdown at his grandson\u2019s birthday party, dressed as a firefighter. He was charged with violating the local emergency management plan, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor last month and was convicted and sentenced, according to court documents. His punishment was a $1,000 fine. Jill Cowan reported from Los Angeles, Jack Healy from Denver, and Thomas Fuller from Moraga, Calif.

    "article_text": "Couple Tested Positive for Coronavirus, Police Say, but They Still Boarded a Plane A couple were arrested and charged with reckless endangerment after they boarded a flight to Hawaii from San Francisco last Sunday, despite knowing that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the police said. The couple, Wesley Moribe, 41, and Courtney Peterson, 46, of Wailua, Hawaii, were tested for the coronavirus in Seattle as part of Safe Travels Hawaii, a program that aims to limit the spread of the virus through testing and tracing. During a stopover in San Francisco, they were told to isolate and not to fly home because their results had come back positive, the police said. The couple, however, ignored the instructions and boarded a United Airlines flight home, \u201cplacing the passengers of the flight in danger of death,\u201d the Kauai police said. The flight from San Francisco to Hawaii typically takes more than five hours. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified local authorities in Hawaii that the couple were on the flight, and they were arrested after the plane landed at Lihue Airport on Kauai, the police said. The officers who processed the couple were equipped with personal protective gear, including gloves, protective gowns, masks and face shields, the police said. They noted that the couple\u2019s booking photos were taken outside to lessen the risk of transmission. The couple\u2019s 4-year-old child, who was traveling with them on their way home from an international trip, was released into the care of a family member, and Child Protective Services was notified, the police said. Mr. Moribe and Ms. Peterson have posted bail, which was set at $1,000 each, the police said. They are scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 6, according to Justin Kollar, the Kauai County prosecuting attorney. If convicted, they could face up to a year in jail or a $2,000 fine, he said. It was not immediately clear if the couple had a lawyer, and there was no answer on Thursday at phone numbers listed under their names. Mr. Kollar said the charges should send a simple message to the public. \u201cNow is not a good time to come to Kauai, period,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources in our health care system to be able to absorb a widespread outbreak of Covid-19. And definitely don\u2019t get on a plane and go anywhere if you\u2019ve tested positive for the coronavirus. That\u2019s pretty basic.\u201d  United Airlines said it had banned the couple from its flights while it investigates. \u201cThe health and safety of our employees and customers is our highest priority, which is why we have various policies and procedures in place as part of a multilayered approach to create a safer travel environment, including mandating that everyone on board wears a mask,\u201d United said in a statement. \u201cPrior to traveling, all United customers are required to complete a \u2018Ready to Fly\u2019 checklist acknowledging they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 14 days.\u201d Todd G. Raybuck, the chief of the Kauai Police Department, said that his officers, along with county and state authorities, \u201cremain diligent in protecting the health and safety of our island.\u201d",

Bush and Bill Clinton \u2014 have said they would be willing to get a vaccine for Covid-19 publicly to help ensure public confidence in its safety, once a vaccine is approved for use in the United States.  \u201cI promise you that when it\u2019s been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it,\u201d Mr. Obama said during an interview with SiriusXM\u2019s Joe Madison, set to air Thursday. \u201cI may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don\u2019t trust is getting Covid.\u201d During the interview, Mr. Obama said he understood why some members of minority groups might be skeptical of being vaccinated, pointing to the history of medical abuse and the mistrust it has engendered among Black people. Among the abuses was the 40-year-long Tuskegee study in which officials from the U.S. Public Health Service allowed Black men infected with syphilis to go untreated. Mr. Obama also discussed the disproportionate number of coronavirus cases and deaths among Black, Hispanic and Native American people. Black and Latino residents are about three times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus and about twice as likely to die from it. It could take until May or June, according to federal officials, for a vaccine to become more widely available to the general public beyond those who are most at-risk and certain priority groups such as health care workers. President Bush\u2019s chief of staff, Freddy Ford, told CNN on Thursday that the former president had reached out to public health officials to see how he could help promote the vaccine. \u201cFirst, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations,\u201d Mr. Ford told the news outlet. \u201cThen, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera.\u201d President Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Angel Urena, told CNN that the former president would also be willing to take the vaccine publicly as soon as it was available to him. \u201cAnd he will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same,\u201d he said.

    "article_text": "After Bar Manager\u2019s Arrest, Covid Culture Wars Escalate on Staten Island When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo mandated a 10 p.m. curfew at bars, Mac\u2019s Public House, a tavern on Staten Island, stayed open after hours. When indoor dining was banned in the area because of high coronavirus infection rates, the bar continued to serve local customers inside. When the state suspended the pub\u2019s liquor license, the general manager announced a way to skirt the law: by serving food and alcohol for free \u2014 still indoors \u2014 in exchange for a contribution. Keith McAlarney, the bar owner, ignored cease-and-desist notices and rapidly accruing fines, he said. Mr. McAlarney painted an orange rectangle out front and declared the bar an \u201cautonomous zone.\u201d He publicly taunted Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, whom he called \u201cde Bozo,\u201d to come down in person and take the license off the wall. But this week, the city and the state struck back, making this tavern a flash point in the Covid culture wars that have turned some business owners and party hosts into rebels against pandemic restrictions. In New York City, Staten Island has been one of the centers of rebellion, even as authorities began constructing an emergency field hospital because of a soaring coronavirus infection rate in the borough. The ZIP code in the area where the bar is located has a 8.62 test positivity rate, the fourth highest among New York City ZIP codes in the last seven days. Staten Island diverges from the city\u2019s four other boroughs in its Republican political leanings and its support for President Trump, and indeed in the desire of some of its residents over the years to secede from the city. On Tuesday, deputies from the city\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office arrested Danny Presti, the bar manager, for obstructing governmental administration. They led him away in handcuffs as protesters and loyal customers heckled them.State Senator Andrew Lanza, a Republican who represents the area, showed up Tuesday night to support the bar and told The New York Post that he was surrounded and physically restrained by deputies when he tried to force his way in to assist Mr. Presti. Mr. Lanza did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. On Wednesday night, protesters gathered outside the bar, many holding American flags and shouting chants against Mr. Cuomo. transcript \u201cThe mayor and the governor \u2014 look around. Look around, here. Look what you made us do. Look what you made good hard-working, tax-paying Americans do.\u201d Protester: \u201cYou\u2019re killing us.\u201d \u201cIt seems that at the worst times is when I\u2019m the proudest to be a New Yorker. Last time I felt this proud was, unfortunately, during Hurricane Sandy, when all of us came together as a community, walking down in New Dorp Beach, all helping each other. And this is exactly what happened then is happening now. We take back our community. We\u2019re all together. We take back Staten Island, tonight.\u201d [cheering] Crowd: \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. McAlarney said he felt he had to take a stand against a whiplash of restrictions that is hurting businesses like his. \u201cI was trying to get their attention so that they would work with the industry instead of being lazy with their decisions and just closing things down,\u201d he said from inside his bar as a phalanx of deputy sheriffs outside kept customers from entering. Because patrons crowd together and talk loudly, health experts have said that bars have often been major spreaders of the virus, which has killed more than 24,000 people in New York City. Still, Mr. McAlarney said he was not persuaded that restrictions on bars were effective in stopping the spread of the virus and questioned the government\u2019s role in regulating gatherings. \u201cIf you feel that it\u2019s not safe to go out, then choose to stay home,\u201d he said. Although many bar owners have bridled at the pandemic restrictions inhibiting their businesses, most have abided by them, often by accommodating drinkers legally outside, on sidewalks, parking lots and street spaces \u2014 and serving them food, at the state\u2019s insistence. But Mr. McAlarney, who said he sunk his life savings to open the bar a year ago, said he felt compelled to resist the city\u2019s \u201cbully tactics.\u201d The free drinks strategy was announced by Mr. Presti on a YouTube video in which he explained from behind the bar that those customer donations would help pay the bar\u2019s bills. \u201cIt was never mandatory, only requested,\u201d Mr. McAlarney said. State officials said that even free service of alcohol without a state license is illegal. The governor\u2019s office criticized Mr. McAlarney for putting politics over pandemic safety. \u201cThis owner is learning that actions have consequences,\u201d said Jack Sterne, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. \u201cBreaking the law and putting your neighbors\u2019 lives at risk during a global pandemic to make a political statement is simply unacceptable.\u201d Regarding the bar declaring itself an autonomous zone, Mitch Schwartz, a mayoral spokesman, said, \u201cCOVID-19 doesn\u2019t respect autonomous zones, and neither does the sheriff \u2014 there are consequences for endangering your neighbors in a pandemic.\u201d Mr. Presti\u2019s arrest came shortly after several plainclothes deputies sat down inside Mac\u2019s and ordered food and alcohol in exchange for a mandatory \u201cdonation\u201d of $40. They observed other patrons were doing the same, said the city\u2019s sheriff, Joseph Fucito. Deputies then issued appearance tickets for multiple violations of city and state laws and ordered Mr. Presti to leave. When he refused, he was arrested, said Mark J. Fonte, a lawyer for the bar\u2019s owners. Mr. Fonte claimed that the city was making an example of the bar for its vocal resistance to \u201conerous restrictions that would put them out of business.\u201d He said that Mac\u2019s was already struggling this fall because restrictions only allowed the owners to seat customers at 25 percent normal capacity. Those limits apply to all indoor dining and drinking in New York City. When the area was designated an orange zone because of its surge in virus cases, with indoor service banned, \u201cit just crushed them, so they\u2019re doing anything possible to try to survive,\u201d Mr. Fonte said.

    "article_text": "California will impose stay-at-home orders in areas where intensive care units are close to capacity. California announced its most aggressive steps since March to head off the coronavirus, saying it will impose sweeping stay-at-home orders region by region when hospitals become overburdened. With cases and hospitalizations rising sharply in the state, Gov. Gavin Newsom portrayed the move as a push to get through a difficult winter before vaccines arrive. \u201cThis is the final surge,\u201d the governor said in a news conference. \u201cThis is the most challenging moment since the beginning of this pandemic.\u201d The new orders will take effect when the intensive care units in a region\u2019s hospitals fill to more than 85 percent of capacity. None of the state\u2019s five regions have reached that threshold yet, but some are expected to this week, officials said. Residents would be required to stay home except for essential tasks and outdoor exercise. Most businesses would have to shut down, including in-person dining, salons and sports events. Hotels in affected areas would be allowed to operate only \u201cin support of critical infrastructure services.\u201d Schools that have been allowed to reopen can continue to operate, and religious services could be held outdoors under the order. The state\u2019s restrictions on religious services may not survive in the federal courts, after the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a federal judge who had upheld them to reconsider the matter. In a change from the strict stay-at-home orders the state imposed in the spring, Mr. Newsom said parks and beaches would remain open, and he encouraged residents to go outside and use them, and even to take outdoor fitness classes. Some cities and counties in the state have already imposed new restrictions as cases have exploded. Los Angeles County issued a similar stay-at-home order last week. Though some municipalities within the county balked, like Pasadena and Beverly Hills, the City of Los Angeles followed up with its own strict stay-at-home order earlier on Thursday. \u201cMy message couldn\u2019t be simpler: It\u2019s time to hunker down,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cancel everything. And if it isn\u2019t essential, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Governor Newsom spoke on Thursday from his home, where he was still under quarantine after three of his children had contact with someone who later tested positive for the virus. His office said on Wednesday that a staff member had also tested positive, but had not been in recent contact with Mr. Newsom. Californians have been on a kind of emotional roller coaster ride since the pandemic began, careening between relief that the state\u2019s early stay-at-home orders helped rein in the virus and alarm that cases surged again despite a slow reopening tailored to each county\u2019s conditions. On Monday, leaders said that new restrictions were in the works, and the governor released dire projections showing that without them, the state\u2019s intensive care units would be overloaded by the middle of this month. Hospitals in hard-hit regions like the San Joaquin Valley, where many low-paid essential workers live in crowded conditions, have been filling up rapidly for weeks. \u201cEverything is on the table, in terms of how we guide the state through this,\u201d Dr. Mark Ghaly, California\u2019s secretary of health and human services, said Monday. But after months of hearing that businesses can safely operate outdoors and with proper precautions, many Californians are pushing back against new restrictions. And a growing list of elected leaders have been caught flouting the rules they\u2019ve urged their constituents to follow. As in March, the rollout of new restrictions, particularly in Los Angeles County, has been confusing, and enforcement has been spotty. Mr. Newsom said on Thursday, as he did repeatedly in the spring, that the state would withhold money from counties that refuse to enforce stay-at-home orders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be punitive, but we wanted to be firm,\u201d he said. That approach, however, has drawn criticism in the past for leading to piecemeal, inconsistent enforcement. Advocates and experts have also criticized a lack of enforcement of protections for essential workers, which has added to the vulnerability of the low-paid Californians who were already more heavily affected by the virus than most others.",

    "article_text": "Spit in a Tube and Mail It In: A New Frontier in Coronavirus Testing FULLERTON, Calif. \u2014 The post-Thanksgiving rush for coronavirus testing is on: Pharmacies in the Southern California suburbs are advising customers lucky enough to score appointments that it could be four days before they receive results. In Chelsea, Mass., a line of people who hoped for testing, pelted by rain and wind, strung along an entire block early this week. In Atlanta, people have idled in cars, sometimes for hours, to get swabbed at drive-throughs. Testing has long been one of the keys to controlling the spread of a virus that with the onset of winter is entering its most dangerous phase. Yet even as cases per capita have rocketed, securing a test has become enough of an ordeal that many people have been dissuaded from even trying. That has begun to change in recent weeks as a handful of communities across the country have rolled out the first do-it-yourself home saliva tests, which require users to simply dribble into a test tube, seal it and send it to a lab. As the tests become widespread, they could provide a less-uncomfortable alternative to nasal swabs and enable more people to safely return to work and school in the months before a vaccine is widely available. In California, Orange County, home to Disneyland and Surf City, last week kicked off an ambitious effort to distribute 500,000 home-use saliva test kits to its 3.4 million residents by the end of December. Its initial push has focused on Anaheim and Santa Ana, the two most populous cities where the pandemic has taken an outsize toll on the Latino and immigrant populations. Among those who stopped by to collect kits outside the Family Health Matters clinic was Sandra Reyes-Aceves, 48, who lives with her two teenage children and aging parents in Anaheim. \u201cThis is the best thing for my parents\u2019 safety. I don\u2019t have to make them leave the house to get tested,\u201d Ms. Reyes-Aceves said. Though no one in her family has symptoms, she said, she worries that she or the children could have the virus and not know it. Public health officials have long hoped that combining the ease of saliva sampling with at-home collection would open important new windows into the spread of the virus and help persuade those who did not know they were infected to stay home and limit further transmission. \u201cThe big issue is, how do you get more people to get tested,\u201d said Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the U.C.L.A. Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cEveryone has seen lines looping around stadiums and urgent cares.\u201d A test people can do at home and mail in \u201creally helps,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to end the pandemic, but it is certainly a major step toward making testing more accessible and widespread.\u201d Minnesota, now with one of the highest rates of new cases in the country, became the first state, in early November, to offer at-home saliva testing for all residents, whether they have coronavirus symptoms or not. Once a testing kit is ordered, it is typically shipped within 24 hours. During sample collection, users are supervised via Zoom by a health worker at Vault Health, the company contracted by Minnesota\u2019s Health Department to manage the tests. Results are available in 24 to 48 hours. \u201cWith community spread at such high levels we\u2019ve focused on removing barriers to make testing as easy and accessible as possible,\u201d said Dan Huff, the department\u2019s assistant commissioner for health protection. Thus far, 261,000 kits manufactured by Infinity BiologiX, the first home-saliva test to secure emergency use authorization from the federal Food and Drug Administration, have been distributed statewide. The decision to make home saliva tests available came as infection rates in Minnesota climbed to new highs. State health officials said it was too early to ascertain whether the availability of new testing was helping to contain the virus. In fact, for the time being, the tests are likely to lead to higher case numbers. Kristine Grover of Blackduck, Minn., said she decided to order the home test after her 12-year-old son, Keaton, came down with a fever, cough and runny nose. \u201cWe knew he would tolerate the saliva test better than the nasal swab,\u201d she said. \u201cI ordered the test on a Monday, he performed the test on Tuesday and we received the negative results on Thursday morning.\u201d A well-designed saliva test can be as accurate as a nasal swab test, scientists say. Researchers have found significant levels of the coronavirus in oral secretions. Like nasal swab tests, saliva tests are based on P.C.R. technology, which amplifies small amounts of viral material for analysis. Sports leagues, schools and colleges were among the early adopters of saliva tests, and newly developed tests have been hitting the market after winning F.D.A. approval. Whether they could supplant nasal swab tests depends, in part, on how quickly labs can ramp up production. In St. Louis, the medical school of Washington University began offering a saliva test to some local teachers this week. In Greenwich, Conn., the Greenwich Academy, an all-girls private school, credits the regular use of spit tests for allowing it to stay open. As home test kits become more widely available, their success in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus could hinge on how often they are used. Communities offering the test generally cover the cost, if a person\u2019s health insurance does not. \u201cWhat is necessary is for people to test frequently,\u201d said Jerry Cangelosi, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cHome testing is effective if it can be done repeatedly, such as weekly, not once a year.\u201d Several counties in New Jersey also have introduced at-home saliva tests, although Burlington County suspended its home testing program after many people took kits and failed to use them. Of the more than 2,400 saliva kits requested by residents and paid for by the county since October, only 900 have been mailed into the lab. \u201cUnfortunately, numerous people have requested the test kits but failed to return them with collected samples for testing, essentially keeping the kits until they decide they need them,\u201d Herb Conaway, the county\u2019s health director, said in a statement. \u201cThis is not how the program was intended to work.\u201d In California, where a new, ominous wave of the pandemic has led to a record surge in cases, widespread testing could be crucial. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: In Orange County, the rate of new coronavirus cases has tripled over the past two weeks. While upscale coastal cities, like Newport Beach, have had relatively few cases, inland cities, like Santa Ana and Anaheim, account for a disproportionately high share of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, and the initial at-home tests are being targeted there. \u201cThe inability of some residents, who lack means, to work remotely or quarantine appropriately has led to a disparity in infection rates between communities,\u201d said Andrew Do, vice chairman of the county\u2019s board of supervisors. \u201cOur challenge will be to get the message out: This is how you protect loved ones, and we\u2019ll be able to go back to businesses and interacting with each other.\u201d Unlike Orange County\u2019s nose-swab testing program, which has targeted people with coronavirus symptoms, the in-home saliva effort is intended to widen testing to include people who might not be suffering from any symptoms. In the initial phase, the county has partnered with five community clinics to distribute 11,000 testing kits. The test was developed by Ambry Genetics, a local company with expertise in genetic diseases that has converted part of its lab to produce the tests. \u201cOur test is literally, you spit up to a point in the tube, seal the cap and mail it in,\u201d said Aaron Elliott, the company\u2019s chief executive, who compared it to consumer genetics tests like those from AncestryDNA. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier than tickling your brain with a nasal swab.\u201d The county plans to open the saliva home-testing program to the entire county as Ambry Genetics ramps up production. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will be a game-changer in a lot of ways,\u201d said Doug Chaffee, a county supervisor who represents a part of Anaheim that is heavily Hispanic. Outside the Family Health Matters clinic, Lisa Ramos, a quality-practice specialist, sat behind a table stacked with blue-and-white boxes. Each kit contained a collection tube with a unique code, a biohazard bag in which to place the sealed tube and a prepaid FedEx envelope. Ms. Ramos explained in Spanish how to properly collect and return the specimens. Without asking people their names or taking any information, she instructed them to register the test online. Results are delivered by email, and those who test positive are contacted by a health care provider. The people who stopped by to pick up kits all said that they either lived in multigenerational homes or shared accommodation with nonrelatives and expressed concern that infection could easily spread among them. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Agustina Esteves, an Argentine college student who works part-time at an auto-repair shop, as she picked up three kits, for herself and two housemates. \u201cI\u2019m going to take the test as soon as I get home.\u201d Maria Romero, 65, said she was aware the coronavirus was coursing through the Latino community, even if it had spared her household, at least as far as everyone knew. So she heeded the Health Department\u2019s call to pick up a test kit for herself and four relatives with whom she lives. \u201cWe feel fine,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we still could have the virus and be passing it to other people.\u201d Kitty Bennett contributed research.",

    "article_text": "Facebook says it will remove coronavirus vaccine misinformation. Facebook on Thursday said it would remove posts that contain claims about Covid-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts, as the social network acts more aggressively to bat down coronavirus misinformation while falsehoods run rampant. The move goes a step beyond how Facebook had handled misinformation about other kinds of vaccines. The company had previously made it more difficult to find vaccine misinformation that was not related to the coronavirus by \u201cdownranking\u201d it, essentially making it less visible in people\u2019s news feeds. But Facebook said it planned to take down Covid-19 vaccine falsehoods entirely if the claims had been discredited or contradicted by health groups including the World Health Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThis is another way that we are applying our policy to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cThis could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines.\u201d Facebook added that it would also take down \u201cfalse claims that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn\u2019t on the official vaccine ingredient list.\u201d The social network has long been hesitant to wade into the fraught space of determining what is true or false information on its platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has made it clear he \u201cdoes not want to be the arbiter of truth\u201d of what is posted on the site. But Mr. Zuckerberg has also taken an active role in combating the spread of coronavirus misinformation. Facebook has created new products and tools to inform the public about the potential dangers of the virus. Mr. Zuckerberg emailed Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection disease expert, as early as March to offer his help in fighting the virus. Dr. Fauci has since appeared on multiple live-streamed interviews on Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg. Because of the novelty of Covid-19 vaccines, not all false claims may be taken down immediately, Facebook said. The social network said it also plans to continue sending people to its Covid-19 Information Center, which contains verified and up-to-date information about the virus. Facebook\u2019s decision to remove vaccine-related misinformation is not without precedent. The company previously removed misinformation about the polio vaccine in Pakistan, as well as misinformation on the measles vaccine in Samoa during outbreaks of the illnesses.",

    "article_text": "Crowded Subways? Yes, in Neighborhoods Where People Have to Go to Work Just after sunrise at a subway station in Woodhaven, Queens, the rhythm of riders pouring onto the platform echoed life before the pandemic. In the 10 minutes between trains, the crowd swelled until riders lined the platform and filed into an arriving subway car, snatching the few remaining seats. Though not quite as bustling as last year, stations like this one and others in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx are experiencing a surge as people who work in retail and service industries return to their jobs in person and join the ranks of essential workers riding the subway. Even as stations in Manhattan that were once the busiest in the city remain eerily quiet \u2014 with as few as one-fifth of typical passenger levels \u2014 ridership at some stops in the other boroughs has surpassed 50 percent of pre-pandemic levels. The spike has breathed life back into a system that was drained of nearly all its riders when the pandemic hit in the spring. It has also provided a little bit of a financial boost to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and is facing its worst budget crisis because of the outbreak. Still, the widening ridership gulf between wealthier Manhattan neighborhoods and lower-income areas illuminates one of the enduring disparities of the outbreak: Many people with white-collar jobs can still work from home while lower-wage workers, who tend to be people of color with long commutes, are venturing to jobs daily even as the virus resurges. \u201cEveryone is practically sitting on top of each other now and virus cases are spiking,\u201d said Adela Rivera, 45, who works in accounting for a cleaning services company in Lower Manhattan and takes the J train at the 85th Street-Forest Parkway station in Queens. \u201cIt all adds to the anxiety for sure.\u201d Her station \u2014 85th Street-Forest Parkway \u2014 is one of a handful in Woodhaven, a middle-class neighborhood home primarily to immigrants from Latin America and Asia, that has experienced a revival. Ridership at the station plunged to roughly 14 percent of usual in April, as people who work as clerks, waiters, housekeepers and kitchen staff stayed home after the pandemic lockdown shut down stores and limited restaurants to takeout and delivery. But as the city slowly reopened, they had to go back to work. As one of the most public transit-dependent neighborhoods in the city, they turned to the subway and buses to travel. By October, around 50 percent of the station\u2019s usual commuters had resumed riding the subway, according to an analysis of transit data by Qri, an open source data company. \u201cWhen I started commuting again in July, at least it was a bit emptier, there were spaces between people on the train,\u201d Ms. Rivera said as she waited on the platform, the warm sunlight filtering through the windows of a train as it roared past. \u201cJust look \u2014 it\u2019s not like that anymore.\u201d The small station serves a fraction of the riders of the subway\u2019s hubs in Manhattan: 85th Street-Forest Parkway station handled an average of 89,000 people a month last year, compared with a monthly average of 5.6 million riders who traveled through Times Square-42nd Street. But with ridership at Times Square and other major hubs like 34 Street-Herald Square and Grand Central hovering at just 20 percent of normal times, the surge of riders across many smaller stations has helped push overall ridership to about 30 percent of usual. In Queens, more than half of stations have seen ridership return to over 40 percent of usual \u2014 more than any other borough. At Junction Boulevard on the No. 7 line and the 111th Street station on the J line, ridership has returned from lows around 10 percent of normal in April to over 55 percent in October. \u201cAt the beginning of all of this back in March, we saw that the folks who were continuing to use the system were essential workers,\u201d said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City Transit, which runs the city\u2019s subway and buses. \u201cToday it continues to be those essential workers and folks with the longest commutes who come into work every day because they cannot do their jobs from home.\u201d The return of rush hour crowds to many parts of the system is a stark turnabout from the height of the pandemic, when the subway\u2019s usual 5.5 million weekday riders had practically vanished. In Manhattan, where the median household income is the highest of any of the five boroughs, monthly ridership was around 7 percent of usual in April, according to the Qri analysis. By comparison, in the Bronx \u2014 where many transit-dependent essential workers live \u2014 roughly 20 percent of the usual ridership was still using the system. In the months since, the system\u2019s revival has been similarly skewed: Ridership has returned to about 40 percent of normal in Brooklyn and 45 percent in the Bronx. In Manhattan, ridership is still just 25 percent of what it was before the outbreak. Many of those low-wage workers who are sustaining the subway will likely bear the brunt of the service cuts and fare increases that officials are weighing as the transit agency faces the worst financial crisis in its history. \u201cThe question that the federal government and state have to wrestle with right now is what do we owe those essential workers?\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. \u201cWill their commutes to essential jobs get even longer and more unreliable?\u201d The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city\u2019s subway and buses, has warned of doomsday cuts like reducing subway service by 40 percent and steep fare increases to make up a $15.9 billion shortfall through 2024. Transit officials have lobbied Washington for $12 billion in federal aid, but after stimulus negotiations sputtered this fall, the agency pinned the future of the system on the outcome of the presidential election. Even with President-elect Joseph R. Biden\u2019s victory, if Republicans are able to retain control of the Senate, they will likely resist the much bigger rescue package House Democrats have been pushing. \u201cThe outlook is certainly better than we would have gotten with a second Trump administration,\u201d said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group. \u201cBut it\u2019s by no means a guarantee that the M.T.A. will get the full rescue package, the whole $12 billion that it\u2019s asking for.\u201d For most riders still using the system \u2014 many of whom are only just finding their footing after being laid off this spring \u2014 higher fares and less reliable service that delays their already long commutes would be a severe hardship. \u201cI spend three hours commuting on the train every day,\u201d said Angela Kerjah, 57. \u201cAnd I\u2019m already rushing back to my three little kids at home. If it takes even longer to get home, will I get to see them every night? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Ms. Kerjah and her friend, Geeta Coyoc, 35, huddled under the small overhang protecting the Woodhaven platform from light rain as they waited for a J train. Both women work as housekeepers for families in Brooklyn and were told by their employers to stay home for four months this spring. But in July, they were called back to work and with trepidation returned to the train. \u201cI think I was more worried to go back out in July than I was before the lockdown,\u201d said Ms. Coyoc. \u201cAfter being home and looking at the news on a daily basis and seeing so many deaths, that\u2019s got me scared.\u201d Since then both women say their concerns about commuting have been allayed after a scientific consensus emerged that the risk of coronavirus transmission on the subway was not as high as many assumed at the start of the pandemic, as long as riders wear masks and crowding remains minimal. But with coronavirus cases climbing yet again in New York, threatening another shutdown, many riders have renewed concerns about their safety on trains, where they have less control over their surroundings and the safety precautions others are taking. \u201cAt work we are distanced, I\u2019m never really close to anyone,\u201d said Walter Fernandez, 26, who works as a cleaner in an office building in Brooklyn and was sent home at the height of the pandemic. \u201cBut here all of the seats are full, you\u2019re right up against everyone and people aren\u2019t always wearing masks.\u201d Earlier this summer he was called back to work, but decided against returning for fear of bringing the virus home to his mother, who lives with him in Woodhaven. But in August, with cases falling in the city, she returned to her work as a housekeeper and he returned to the office he cleans. As cases creep up, so has Mr. Fernandez\u2019s anxiety. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it,\u201d he said. Ten minutes down the J line, Sayda Ighmor, 35, sat on a wooden bench at 111th Street Station on her way to work as a home health aide. Every morning Ms. Ighmor takes the train five stops and then gets on the Q54 bus to get to work, which is the most nerve-racking part of her day. \u201cIt\u2019s so crowded on the buses \u2014 even more than the train \u2014 and some people still don\u2019t wear masks,\u201d she said. Every afternoon when she arrives home, she carefully places her shoes beside the door, strips off her work clothes and jumps in the shower. Ms. Ighmor opted to keep her two children home to do remote schooling this fall because it felt safer. But both she and her husband, who works in food delivery, have continued to work throughout the pandemic. \u201cYou have to go to work,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to pay your bills. What should I do?\u201d",

    "article_text": "U.K. and U.S. Officials Spar Over \u2018Vaccine Nationalism\u2019 LONDON \u2014 British and American officials sparred on Thursday over how Britain had beaten the United States to authorizing a coronavirus vaccine, a debate touching on politics and regulatory styles that has heated up as wealthy countries vie to receive the first shipments of vaccines. In Britain, the euphoria of winning the global race to authorizing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was quickly giving way to a more sober realization of the choices facing the country\u2019s National Health Service as it tries to deliver the first doses into people\u2019s arms by Monday. Nursing home residents, who had been named the government\u2019s top priority, have fallen down the list. Doctors and nurses were expecting to be vaccinated first, but those plans appeared to be in flux. Meanwhile, the government pleaded with people not to call hospitals, asking for a shot. The question of whether Britain had authorized a vaccine in haste on Wednesday, or the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 1,500 Americans a day, has divided scientists and has also drawn in politicians. Facing criticism from American and European regulators, British officials boasted of the decision on Thursday, with one lawmaker suggesting the Europeans were \u201ca bit sniffy\u201d and others misleadingly crediting Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got the best medical regulators,\u201d Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said in a radio interview, by way of explaining why Britain had become the first Western country to authorize a vaccine. \u201cMuch better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn\u2019t surprise me at all because we\u2019re a much better country than every single one of them, aren\u2019t we.\u201d Those remarks drew eye rolls from British scientists, but also provoked more serious concerns that any chest-beating by government ministers risked undermining the public\u2019s faith in a vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that British regulators had not scrutinized data from clinical trials as carefully as their American counterparts in the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cWe have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the F.D.A.,\u201d Dr. Fauci said in an interview on Fox News. \u201cThe U.K. did not do it as carefully and they got a couple of days ahead.\u201d Approval could come as early as next week from the F.D.A., and at the end of the month from European Union regulators. Pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have incorrectly cast Britain\u2019s split with the European Union as the reason it authorized a vaccine first. In fact, Britain remains under the bloc\u2019s regulatory umbrella until Dec. 31 when it comes to drug and vaccine approvals, but was able to move more quickly because of European regulations enabling countries to act independently in public health emergencies. While as a political matter, Brexit may have made it easier for Britain to authorize the vaccine early, analysts said, the divorce has made the job of its medical regulators more difficult in other ways. And the flag-waving of pro-Brexit lawmakers was doing little to engender public trust in vaccines, scientists said. \u201cVaccine nationalism has no place in Covid or other public health matters of global significance,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a scientific adviser to the British government. \u201cScience has always been the exit strategy from this horrendous pandemic \u2014 that science has been global.\u201d With the first inoculations just a few days away, Britons were parsing the government\u2019s shifting and sometimes vague statements about who would get the vaccine and when.  A government advisory committee had recommended that nursing home residents and workers be first in line for the vaccine, to prevent suffering and deaths among the most vulnerable and to protect the country\u2019s overburdened hospitals as they deal with a second wave of infections. More than a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales have happened in nursing homes. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that the Pfizer vaccine, owing to its ultracold storage needs, would only be administered in hospitals for the time being, ruling out nursing home residents as the first recipients. \u201cWe\u2019re all sat in this sort of limbo of, \u2018Are we getting it? Aren\u2019t we getting it?\u2019\u201d said Adam Purnell, an administrator at Kepplegate, a small nursing home in northwestern England.  \u201cIt just breaks my heart the stories I am hearing of not being able to see their loved ones,\u201d he added. \u201cTo have another promise crumble underneath them is quite insensitive to those people that live in care homes and their relatives.\u201d Roughly 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with BioNTech, a German company, were being packaged at the company\u2019s Belgian manufacturing plant this week for shipment to Britain. How and when they will arrive was being kept secret for security reasons, the company said, though the BBC reported on Thursday that some of the doses were being transported through the Eurotunnel between France and Britain Pfizer sought to shut down questions this week about whether people in Britain would be able to pay to cut the line for inoculation, which requires two doses, given a month apart. \u201cI can say clearly and confidently that there are no plans to supply the private sector for the foreseeable future \u2014 no chance at all,\u201d Ben Osborn, Pfizer\u2019s Britain country manager, said on Wednesday, adding that for the sake of equity, the public National Health Service would decide whom to vaccinate. And despite the predictions of some analysts that a black market in vaccines was inevitable, Mr. Osborn insisted that people trying to sell the shot without authorization would not be able to divert doses from its supply chain. As for the National Health Service\u2019s plans, hospitals had been sending internal emails in recent days outlining plans for scheduling shots for doctors and nurses. A government advisory committee has suggested that older or more vulnerable health workers, and doctors and nurses who work with fragile patients, would be among the first in line. The logistics of moving, defrosting and preparing the vaccine were so complicated, the government said, that it would only be given at 50 British hospitals to begin with. But by Thursday, there were indications that before health workers were vaccinated, the government wanted to offer shots to nursing home workers and people age 80 and over who were already coming to hospitals for other reasons. It still appeared likely that doctors and nurses would be among those receiving vaccines in the coming weeks. Sally Gilbert, an anesthetic technician who has been working on the coronavirus ward at a hospital in Hull, in northeast England, said she was relieved to hear of a vaccine being authorized. \u201cI hope this helps us get back to some kind of normality,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever that is.\u201d Though details were scarce about how vaccinations would work at her hospital, she said she had received an email suggesting that staff members could begin getting shots on Monday.  \u201cI\u2019m sure they have a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just haven\u2019t told us yet.\u201d Megan Specia contributed reporting from London.",

    "article_text": "Swiss politicians defy warnings against singing, and other news from around the world. Public health officials in Switzerland have already made a point of warning against singing in groups. The admonition came after 600 people attended yodeling concerts in September, leading to a virus hot spot. So when a group of politicians in Parliament sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Ueli Maurer, Switzerland\u2019s finance minister and former president who was turning 70 on Tuesday, critics cried hypocrisy, or at least inconsistency. Holding about 30 red balloons, most of the elected celebrants failed to wear masks or maintain their distance during the singalong. In a separate celebration, a band played in Parliament, which also goes against the government\u2019s recommendation. \u201cIt is better to listen to Christmas songs over your sound system,\u201d the government guidelines say. The events have caused an uproar in Switzerland, which has struggled to keep the pandemic under control while maintaining looser restrictions than much of Europe. One member of Parliament posted a video of the birthday song on Twitter, leading to hundreds of angry replies. Here\u2019s what else is happening around the world. The Russian capital will open 70 vaccination centers on Saturday with teachers, doctors and social workers the first in line to receive the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, Moscow\u2019s mayor said on Thursday. City residents will have to register online in advance for time slots to avoid overcrowding. On Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin ordered a voluntary vaccination program to begin by the end of next week across the country. But several hospitals near Moscow already began administering the vaccine last week. Russian authorities rushed to offer it, and drew criticism for not waiting for large-scale efficacy tests to conclude. Germany extended its lockdown, which includes the closure of bars and restaurants, to Jan. 10, three weeks after its restrictions were scheduled to expire on Dec. 20. Infection rates remain at over 50 cases per 100,000 people in a week, a goal that Chancellor Angela Merkel said allows health authority to trace individual infections. Health authorities registered 22,046 new cases on Wednesday, roughly the same as three weeks ago. Greece is also extending its national lockdown, which was set to end on Dec. 7, by one week, a decision the government said was unavoidable with new daily infections steadily rising and a sharp spike in deaths. The rising number of new cases has stretched hospitals to the limit, particularly in northern Greece where the majority of infections are being recorded. As of Wednesday, it had a total of 109,655 confirmed cases and 2,604 deaths, most of which have been recorded over the past month. Austria will loosen its lockdown beginning Monday, but bars and restaurants will remain closed until at least Jan. 7 and quarantines will extend to 10 days for arriving travelers. Those in quarantine will be allowed to take a free test after five days and can leave isolation early if it comes back negative. While announcing the changes, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz appeared to blame people with family abroad for reintroducing the virus to Austria when returning from visits at the end of the summer, prompting criticism in the country. The former president of France, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, a modern-minded conservative who on his election in 1974 vowed to transform his tradition-bound, politically polarized country, only to lose his office seven years later after failing to accomplish his goals, died on Wednesday. His foundation said the cause was complications of Covid-19. He was 94.",

    "article_text": "As Hospitals Fill, Travel Nurses Race to Virus Hot Spots As the coronavirus cut a devastating path around the country, Laura Liffiton, 32, found herself racing along behind. She arrived in New York City in April, on one of the worst days of the pandemic, for a stint as a nurse in the overrun intensive-care unit of a crowded hospital. After her contract there ended, she flew in July to another hot spot with an urgent need for nurses: a hospital in Arizona where four of her patients died of the coronavirus on her first day. In October, Ms. Liffiton traveled on, to Green Bay, Wis., just as the virus was surging uncontrollably throughout the Midwest. \u201cWhen the pandemic began, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to go help, I can do some good, I can make some good money,\u2019\u201d she said. But on the first day of treating coronavirus patients, Ms. Liffiton remembered, \u201cI was like Dorothy landing in Oz. I was totally unprepared for the reality.\u201d As the coronavirus has spiked across the country, leaving a record 100,226 Americans hospitalized on Wednesday, travel nurses, who work on temporary contracts for higher fees and move from city to city, have become more urgently needed than ever. More deaths were reported on Wednesday than on any other day of the pandemic, surpassing the single-day death record of 2,752, set in April. And federal officials suggested that the picture may grow still worse in the months ahead. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that the nation was facing a devastating winter, predicting that total deaths from Covid-19 could reach \u201cclose to 450,000\u201d by February unless a large percentage of Americans follow precautions like mask-wearing. \u201cThe reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times,\u201d Dr. Redfield said. \u201cI actually believe they\u2019re going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.\u201d As hospitals fill with virus patients, the biggest need has been finding enough staff to tend to the critically ill. Demand for travel nurses has increased by more than 40 percent in the last month, according to Aya Healthcare, an agency based in California that dispatches them to hospitals. At least 25,000 nurses work in travel nursing, though the number fluctuates, and hospitals have depended on them for decades. It is a nomadic existence and, in a pandemic, a particularly high-risk one. The nurses parachute into cities like New York, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Green Bay for weeks or months at a time, quickly learning the ways of a new hospital and trying to earn the trust of the existing staff. At the end of their shifts, they return to their temporary homes: hotels, Airbnb apartments or rented houses. Their families and friends are sometimes thousands of miles away, available only through phone calls or FaceTime. Last week in Green Bay, where the surrounding county has averaged more than 150 cases a day since late September, a team of four travel nurses worked at Bellin Hospital, grappling with the unrelenting pressure of the emergency room and a Thanksgiving holiday far from home. More than eight months into the pandemic, many travel nurses have done little else but treat Covid-19 patients. Ms. Liffiton still shudders when recounting what she saw in New York in April: doctors and nurses who were overwhelmed, rows of intubated patients and little sense of when the devastation would end. She still sleeps only about four hours a night, troubled by what she has seen throughout the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cEven after I leave a place, the feelings stay.\u201d Morgan Fitzsimmons, a travel nurse who is based in Lake Geneva, Wis., has been treating coronavirus patients since a stint working in Syracuse, N.Y., in July. In Green Bay, where she is temporarily based, the weather has now turned cold and blustery. Some people are still gathering indoors, going to bars and to restaurants and weddings. \u201cThe hospital\u2019s getting tight,\u201d said Ms. Fitzsimmons, who is 26. \u201cHalf of your patients that you\u2019re going to see in a day more than likely have Covid or are getting tested for Covid. They\u2019re coming in and getting tested. They go home and then they get sicker and they come back.\u201d The treatment options have improved since her work in Syracuse this summer. But the skepticism surrounding the virus in places like Green Bay has only deepened, she said. Just before the election, Ms. Fitzsimmons said, she was treating a patient who repeated a conspiracy theory that has circulated on the internet and in conservative media: The coronavirus is a hoax perpetuated by Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m taking care of this man and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t wait for the election to be over so all this will all go away,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s real, I promise you, it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d Others have all but shrugged when they receive a positive coronavirus result. \u201cA lot of people tend to have the response, when they\u2019re told they have it, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got the Covid,\u2019\u201d said Heather Ozmun, 46, a travel nurse in Green Bay. \u201cThey\u2019re treating it like a rite of passage, like it\u2019s their turn to have it.\u201d John Deaton, 27, has spent most of his nursing career so far as a traveler, as they are commonly called. Throughout the pandemic, he has treated Covid-19 patients and even caught a mild case of the virus himself, working in El Centro, Calif., near the border with Mexico; Sacramento; and now Green Bay. Places to stay in northeastern Wisconsin were difficult to find. He settled for renting the basement in a house while the owner lives upstairs, negotiating for shared use of the kitchen so he would have more than a microwave to use for cooking. Mr. Deaton, who is from Akron, Ohio, was attracted to travel nursing because it pays so well \u2014 he estimated that he makes four times what he would earn if he accepted a staff position somewhere. There is a range of pay for such work, but a weekly paycheck could be more than $5,000 during the pandemic, by some of the nurses\u2019 estimates, in addition to benefits. \u201cI think this attracts a couple different personality types,\u201d he said. \u201cI travel for the money. Some people travel to travel \u2014 they like being in other places, they want the locations of San Diego or Hawaii.\u201d The dynamic between staff nurses and travel nurses can be complicated. Mr. Deaton said that when he was in Sacramento, staff nurses were given higher-quality equipment to use, such as air-purifying respirators, that travel nurses had to repeatedly request. \u201cWe\u2019re here because they have a need,\u201d he said of hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019re not people that are going to be here later on.\u201d Ms. Liffiton and Ms. Fitzsimmons, away from their families for Thanksgiving, decided to celebrate the holiday together, in Ms. Fitzsimmons\u2019s Airbnb. They skipped the traditional turkey and opted for a seafood pasta with spicy tomato sauce, followed by pumpkin pie and chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Ms. Liffiton roasted the pumpkins herself. \u201cYou can take me out of my home but you can\u2019t take the home out of me,\u201d she said. On Dec. 19, Ms. Liffiton\u2019s contract in Green Bay will be finished, and she will head back home to rest and spend time with her family. A week after that, she is back to New York for a 13-week hospital assignment. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating that I\u2019m still going back,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many of the people in New York are already doing such a good job of quarantining. And yet this is still a problem there.\u201d",

By Wadzanai Mhute Latinos Progresando entered new territory when the coronavirus pandemic hit Chicago. The organization, a nonprofit that focuses on assisting immigrants, suddenly needed to shift its programming. Its founder, Luis Gutierrez, saw people who\u2019d counted on their jobs at restaurants being laid off, as well as needs in the community for personal protective equipment and more access to food. \u201cFood insecurity is real in this country, and since Covid hit, the amount of people in need of food has gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cOrganizations like ours in the city and country have just been stepping in to fill in these gaps. A lot of these things were there but Covid exposed it. Nobody can deny it. You can\u2019t look away.\u201d Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. To meet the community\u2019s needs, Latinos Progresando gave financial help to people who\u2019d lost jobs. The organization also began to distribute masks and groceries to those struggling. On the first day of one pop-up stand, in August, 40 people were in line at 6 a.m. for a food distribution that started at 10 a.m. When these challenges suddenly arose, Latinos Progresando received support from the Hispanic Federation. The Hispanic Federation has given $14 million in emergency assistance grants to help more than 200 organizations coping with immediate needs because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was among the organizations to support the emergency grants. The Hispanic Federation grants also supported ourBridge in North Carolina, which provides food and tutoring for children in the community. Ruby Orduna credits ourBridge with helping her and her family onto a better track. A single mother and immigrant from Mexico with no family in the United States, Ms. Orduna learned about the program three years ago, when she was working late hours and her children would stay with a sitter for long periods. Sometimes it was hard for her to pay her bills and see to her children\u2019s needs. The program has been a lifesaver, she said, especially for her younger children. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me and my kids emotionally a great deal,\u201d she said in Spanish through an interpreter. \u201cI pick them up, help them with their homework. Since I didn\u2019t have family to rely on here, now they feel like they have a family.\u201d Ms. Orduna, 42, had worked at a computer cables plant, where she carried heavy loads, sometimes 90 wires at a time, causing shoulder injuries. While attending an ourBridge health fair, she learned about open positions at the organization and started volunteering in the kitchen. A few months later, she was hired as a classroom assistant. Sil Ganz\u00f3, the executive director of ourBridge, says her staff is very connected to the community\u2019s refugees, asylum seekers and first-generation immigrants. At the outset of the pandemic, the most pressing need among them was food, and the Hispanic Federation assistance helped provide 5,000 breakfasts and lunches. \u201cWe made sure that the meals we were providing were culturally appropriate,\u201d Ms. Ganz\u00f3 said. \u201cThe meals, the products and produce were selected and handpicked by people from that community.\u201d Citymeals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers meals to older adults in New York City, also received a grant this year from The Fund\u2019s endowment, which receives donations larger than $100,000. Citymeals recipients are generally homebound and many are further limiting their time around others because of the virus.  \u201cOftentimes all people need is to age in their homes, the meal coming to the door, someone checking on them and making sure they are OK,\u201d said Catharine Bufalino, an associate director in communications for Citymeals. Particularly now, she added, \u201cpeople really want to age in their homes, and programs like ours are enabling that.\u201d Among those receiving help from Citymeals is Arthur Williams, who said he learned fortitude as a professional musician. \u201cIt taught me to be mentally strong,\u201d he said in a recent interview, \u201cby having the courage to get up. When you are rejected, you have to have the resilience to get up and try again.\u201d For 25 years, Mr. Williams traveled the world singing with the Belafonte Folk Singers, a backup group to Harry Belafonte, and other groups, later cofounding the Phoenix Singers. After his touring ended, he taught and became a soloist at Salem United Methodist Church in Harlem. Now retired, Mr. Williams heard about Citymeals on Wheels from a friend a year ago. Because he is H.I.V. positive and takes medication, his meals are nutritionally structured with his health in mind. \u201cThey sustained me,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done without them.\u201d Food insecurity remains a serious concern around the country and in New York. In the city, an estimated 1.4 million people face food insecurity, according to Food Bank for New York City. The Food Bank and City Harvest also received grants from The Fund this year to address the issue; both are in the network of Feeding America, a beneficiary agency of The Fund\u2019s annual campaign. Food Bank for New York City said there was a 40 percent increase in the need since March; it has served 56 million meals through 800 partners. Nutritionists and dietitians assist people who rely on its service with choosing food that is nutritious and healthy while also fitting their budget. And beyond groceries, it offers tax assistance. \u201cWe help New Yorkers file their taxes with a particular focus on earned-income tax credits to get real cash back into people\u2019s pockets in amounts that are really transformational,\u201d said Leslie Gordon, chief executive of the Food Bank, \u201cand can take people from being on the precipice of losing housing, not being able to pay their bills to potentially having some small amount of saving.\u201d During the holiday season, food pantries and soup kitchens need more food, and City Harvest anticipates operating at a heightened capacity into the new year, said Laura Casale, a communications manager for the organization. \u201cWe are seeing a very high level of need across the city still,\u201d said Dan Lavoie, director of communications at City Harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to realize that it\u2019s still going on and that the need has not gone away. It still is growing.\u201d Donations to The Neediest Cases Fund may be made online or with a check.",

    "article_text": "Cyberattacks Discovered on Vaccine Distribution Operations A series of cyberattacks is underway aimed at the companies and government organizations that will be distributing coronavirus vaccines around the world, IBM\u2019s cybersecurity division has found, though it is unclear whether the goal is to steal the technology for keeping the vaccines refrigerated in transit or to sabotage the movements. The findings were alarming enough that the Department of Homeland Security issued its own warning on Thursday about the threat. Both the IBM researchers and the department\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said the attacks appear intended to steal the network log-in credentials of corporate executives and officials at global organizations involved in the refrigeration process necessary to protect vaccine doses. Josh Corman, a coronavirus strategist at the cybersecurity agency, said in a statement that the IBM report was a reminder of the need for \u201ccybersecurity diligence at each step in the vaccine supply chain.\u201d He urged organizations \u201cinvolved in vaccine storage and transport to harden attack surfaces, particularly in cold storage operation.\u201d Researchers for IBM Security X-Force, the company\u2019s cybersecurity arm, said they believed that the attacks were sophisticated enough that they pointed to a government-sponsored initiative, not a rogue criminal operation aimed purely at monetary gain. But they could not identify which country might be behind them. No matter who conducted the attacks, they underscore how everything about coronavirus vaccines \u2014 how to make them, test them and move them \u2014 has become vital information around the globe. A year ago, nations including Russia and China were focusing their covert efforts on stealing secrets about hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence advances; six months ago, intelligence agencies shifted their focus to obtaining, or defending, proprietary vaccine research. With several vaccines on the verge of moving from clinical trials into wider use, the IBM discovery suggests that the main target of state-employed hackers is now the infrastructure of delivering the vaccines to billions of people around the globe. The cyberattackers \u201cwere working to get access to how the vaccine is shipped, stored, kept cold and delivered,\u201d said Nick Rossmann, who leads IBM\u2019s global threat intelligence team. \u201cWe think whoever is behind this wanted to be able to understand the entire cold chain process.\u201d There is no indication so far that the attackers were aiming at Pfizer or Moderna, whose vaccines are expected to be the first ones approved for emergency use in the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer said Wednesday that the company\u2019s cold storage equipment was designed by security-conscious experts and custom-built to match the specific requirements of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, which must be stored at extremely cold temperatures. Many of the approaches came in the form of \u201cspear phishing\u201d emails that impersonated an executive at a major Chinese company, Haier Biomedical, which is a legitimate participant in the distribution chain. The email says \u201cwe want to place an order with your company,\u201d and includes a draft contract containing malware that would give the attackers access to the network. Outside experts said they doubted the attacks came from China, which has been accused of trying to steal vaccine information from universities, hospitals and medical researchers, because it would be unlike Chinese hackers to impersonate executives at a major Chinese firm. If they are correct, the lead suspects would be hackers in Russia and North Korea, both of which have also been accused by the United States of conducting attacks to steal information about the process of manufacturing and distributing vaccines. Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between official hacking operations for the Russian or North Korean governments and those run for private gain. The motive is also unclear. The attackers may simply be looking to steal technology to move large amounts of vaccine across long distances at extraordinarily low temperatures, which would constitute a classic form of intellectual property theft. But some cybersecurity experts say they suspect something more nefarious: efforts to interfere with the distribution, or ransomware, in which the vaccines would be essentially held hostage by hackers who have gotten into the system that runs the distribution network and locked it up \u2014 and who demand a large payment to unlock it. \u201cThere is no intelligence advantage in spying on a refrigerator,\u201d said James Lewis, who runs the cybersecurity programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cMy suspicion is that they are setting up for a ransomware play. But we won\u2019t know how these stolen credentials will be used until after the vaccine distribution begins.\u201d The IBM researchers provided an account of their efforts in an interview before the company posted its findings. They said the attackers sent out various requests for price and product information, some purportedly on behalf of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries. Many of the targets were in Asia, but some were European, including the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union. IBM noted that the organization has \u201cdirect ties to multiple national government networks,\u201d showing that the attackers had a sophisticated understanding of how to identify targets that could get them into many nations. But other organizations were also targeted, like Taiwan, South Korea, Germany and Italy. Some were involved in the solar panel-driven cooling systems for the vaccine. The attackers\u2019 emails were addressed to companies that provide key components of the cold chain process. Those include ice-lined boxes for vaccines and the solar panels that can power refrigerated vaccine containers \u2014 an important feature in poor countries where electricity can be scarce. The researchers said the effort seemed aimed at stealing credentials that could have ultimately led the attackers to a trove of information, including timetables for vaccine distribution, lists of vaccine recipients and where doses are being shipped. IBM could not determine whether the attacks were successful, the company said. The researchers said the attackers targeted one Gavi program started in 2015, before the advent of the coronavirus, to upgrade cold chain equipment for vaccines in dozen of nations. UNICEF, which is planning vaccine delivery for poorer countries, appears to have been another target. Najwa Mekki, a spokeswoman for the organization, said the IBM researchers alerted officials to the threat to the cold chain system, and \u201cwe notified our supply networks and alerted relevant teams to the need to increase vigilance.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "\u2018Field of Broken Dreams\u2019: London\u2019s Growing Taxi Graveyards EPPING, England \u2014 Drive through a leaf-strewn forest and past a charming street market in this town about 20 miles northeast of London, and a jarring sight appears: black London taxis, parked bumper-to-bumper by the hundreds in a muddy field, surrounded by beehives and a barn for raising squab pigeons. It\u2019s a camera-ready monument to the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic. The cabs were returned by their drivers to a rental company because of the collapse in business after Britain went into lockdown last March. As the number of idled taxis piled up, the company ran out of room in its garage and cut a deal with a local farmer to store about 200 of them alongside his bees and pigeons. \u201cI call it the field of broken dreams,\u201d said Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents about half of the British capital\u2019s more than 21,500 licensed cabbies. \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d On Wednesday, England emerged from its second lockdown, but severe restrictions remain in effect, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when central London\u2019s deserted streets will once again fill with office workers, theatergoers and tourists. As of now, barely a fifth of London\u2019s taxis are currently operating, Mr. McNamara said, and the drivers still on the road are averaging just a quarter of their pre-pandemic fares. The city estimates that 3,500 taxis have left the streets since June. They are stashed in parking lots, warehouses, garages and fields all around the capital. To Mr. McNamara, who earned his scars battling for taxi drivers against the competition from Uber and other ride-hailing services, the pandemic is an even greater existential threat. Unless the government offers more financial aid, he said, London could lose one of its most recognizable symbols \u2014 one that ranks, in the tourist lexicon, with red double-decker buses, phone boxes and police officers in their dome-like helmets. \u201cThe buses aren\u2019t red anymore, the telephone boxes are gone, and policemen now sit in BMWs with submachine guns,\u201d Mr. McNamara said, unfurling a colorful line he has doubtless used before. \u201cWe\u2019re the only London icon left, and I genuinely fear that we\u2019re not going to be around in three years.\u201d To some who watched the war between black taxis and Uber, the cabbies were not always the most sympathetic figures. For one thing, their services were, and still are, more expensive. Predominantly white, male and English, the cabbies present a superannuated vision of Britain, next to the ethnically diverse immigrants and other strivers who get behind the wheel and slap an Uber decal on their window. With Uber\u2019s customer service and image problems, however, the battle lines are no longer so clear. Also, Mr. McNamara said, the taxis have smartened up their service with phone-pay software, Uber-like apps that allow people to call a cab, and environmentally clean electric vehicles. Had the pandemic not struck, he said, 85 percent to 90 percent of the fleet would have been electric by the end of 2024. There is no dispute that Britain\u2019s lockdowns have devastated the trade. Ryan Spedding, who has driven a cab for nearly nine years, vividly recalls when Prime Minister Boris Johnson went on television in March to declare, \u201cFrom this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home.\u201d The next day, Mr. Spedding, 44, drove his Mercedes taxi into London to discover a ghost town of darkened pubs and shops, deserted office towers and empty railway stations. Normally teeming spaces like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square needed only blowing tumbleweed to complete the portrait of urban desolation. \u201cYou could drive around for two or three hours and not see a person on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go from your day ticking along nicely to something out of \u201828 Days Later,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the Danny Boyle movie about a deadly virus that transforms London into an eerie post-apocalyptic landscape. Mr. Spedding pays 280 pounds, about $375, a week to rent his taxi. At that rate, he saw no option but to return the car to his rental company, GB Taxi Services. As a self-employed person, Mr. Spedding was eligible for state aid that has compensated him for about two-thirds of his average income. He and his wife, whose dog-walking business was hurt by canceled vacations and clients who now work at home and can walk their own pets, have also gotten a break on their mortgage payments. But Mr. Spedding said he had dipped into his savings and run up credit card debt to stay afloat. Mostly, he said, he is \u201cbored as hell.\u201d Like all licensed drivers, he passed a fearsomely rigorous test of London\u2019s streets, known as the Knowledge, a process that took him three and a half years. Having invested so much of his life in becoming a driver, Mr. Spedding said, \u201cI can\u2019t even think about doing something else.\u201d This week, Mr. Spedding said he planned to take his taxi out for a post-lockdown spin to see if customers would return. \u201cThere is a big part of me that thinks maybe not,\u201d he said. To make up for lost business, some drivers, like Dale Forwood, have taken to offering tours of the Christmas lights on Regent Street. There are few tourists to sign up, but locals, cooped up after weeks of lockdown, seem eager to get out. Ms. Forwood, 54, also drives a delivery van for a supermarket chain. As she navigated the lightly trafficked streets one recent night, she spoke wistfully about how London was normally jammed with shoppers from all over the world at Christmas. With the return of those visitors still dependent on a vaccine-secured future, local residents remain the lifeline for taxi drivers. \u201cAs long as people use us,\u201d she said, \u201cthey won\u2019t lose us.\u201d For drivers like Jim Ward, who own their cars, the drought is more bearable. He said he is picking up about four fares a day, earning an average of \u00a360, about $80, compared with about \u00a3150 during good times. But he bought his cab, the familiar boxy model made by the London Taxi Company \u2014 since renamed the London Electric Vehicle Company \u2014 secondhand years ago, and his costs are modest. Since January 2018, all newly licensed cabs in London must be electric. A new electric model goes for about \u00a365,000, about $87,000; many drivers finance the purchase, which saddles them with heavy monthly payments. \u201cThe young guys, who are doing this with financing, can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Mr. Ward said of the repayments during the pandemic. Mr. Ward, who is 67 and has been driving for 46 years, notes that the taxi profession has plied the streets of London since Oliver Cromwell licensed hackney carriage drivers in the 17th century to cut down on robberies (an example of the charming historical nuggets that seem to flow fluently from the mouths of black-cab drivers). As they idle at somnolent train stations or in front of empty hotels, cabbies swap horror stories (one waited 22 and a half hours for a fare at Heathrow Airport). And they play a doleful game of what-might-have-been. Howard Taylor, who is 60 and has been driving for 33 years, considered selling his three-year-old cab before the pandemic hit. Now, he figures, he\u2019d lose at least a third of its value. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be a fool to buy it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause right now, driving a cab is not a viable proposition.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The College-Entrance Exam Is 9 Hours Long. Covid-19 Made It Harder. SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Nearly a half-million South Korean high school seniors hunkered down on Thursday to take an annual university-entrance exam they had been preparing for since kindergarten \u2014 a nine-hour marathon of tests that could decide their futures. But this year, the government had to ensure the exam did not become a super-spreader event for the coronavirus. For days, health officials in full protective gear had repeatedly disinfected 31,000 classrooms where the exam was to take place. All students had to get their temperature taken before entering the classrooms. They sat at desks separated by plastic dividers and wore masks throughout the test. Government-run health clinics stayed overnight to test students and screen anyone infected with the virus at the last minute. Those with a fever or sore throat were escorted to separate rooms to take their exams. At least one student showed up in full protective gear for fear of catching the coronavirus. \u201cI came early because I feared that I might be caught in a traffic jam,\u201d another student, Kim Mun-jeong, told the cable channel JTBC. \u201cI also wanted to check into the test-taking room sooner than other students to get myself familiarized with it and gain composure.\u201d In this education-obsessed country, it\u2019s hard to overestimate the importance of the College Scholastic Ability Tests, or suneung, in the life of a South Korean student. Most universities select their students based largely on the test scores of the single standardized year-end exam. Diplomas from a few top universities like Seoul National can make a huge difference when applying for jobs and promotions. Many students who fail to enter the universities they covet take the tests again and again in the following years, often living and studying in institutes with militarylike discipline. Exam day is also a day when the country collectively wrings its hands and much of life is put on pause. All banks, businesses and government offices delayed opening their doors by an hour to lessen road traffic. All planes were grounded and all military guns silenced for half an hour for fear they might interrupt students focused on an English listening-comprehension test. In the Jogyesa Buddhist temple in Central Seoul, parents lit candles and burned incense as they prayed for the success of their children taking the exam. The pandemic has added new twists and an extra layer of anxiety and suspense to the grueling test. South Korea is grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, with health officials reporting some of the highest daily caseloads the country has seen. In the past week, the country has reported 438 to 581 new cases per day, including 540 on Thursday. \u201cExam-takers and their parents, who have been supporting them, have had a tougher time this year than ever because of Covid-19,\u201d said Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, referring to how the pandemic has upended school life. \u201cWe must do everything we can to make sure that the students take their exam safely, and prepare for any emergencies that can happen during the exam day.\u201d Suneung usually takes place in mid-November, but the test was pushed back by two weeks because the pandemic delayed school openings by a month in spring. Officials took extra precautions to make sure students reached the exam sites safely and on time. On Thursday, police officers with motorcycles were dispatched to pick up those running late for the test. Even those who tested positive for the virus got the chance to take the college-entrance exam. The Education Ministry and health officials prepared negative-pressure hospital chambers at the Seoul Medical Center and 24 other hospitals so that 35 students with Covid-19 could take their exams while exam administrators wearing Level-D protective suits kept watch. Nurses also kept a close eye on the students through closed-circuit television screens for signs of trouble. More than 400 students under a two-week quarantine were also allowed to sit for the test in the specially prepared facilities. Updated Dec. 7, 2020 The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education. The importance of suneung can be traced back to the destitute decades following the Korean War, when families saw education as the ticket for their children to escape poverty. The country\u2019s razor-sharp focus on education is often cited for helping its dramatic postwar transformation, going from one of the world\u2019s poorest under dictatorship to one of its richest democracies. Today, young South Koreans are among the world\u2019s most highly educated. In 2017, 70 percent of the country\u2019s population of 25- to 34-year-olds had a tertiary education, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Many families start preparing their children from kindergarten, enrolling them in after-school cram sessions or hiring private tutors to elevate their math and English-language skills. Wealthy families fork over thousands of dollars a month to help their children, creating a multibillion-dollar exam-preparation industry and eroding a once widely held belief among poorer families that college-entrance exams were a great equalizer for social mobility. The exam has been linked, however, to troubling trends. The soaring educational costs are often blamed for the country\u2019s low birthrates, as families felt they could not afford to finance the education of multiple children. Suicide is the No. 1 cause of death for South Koreans between the ages of 10 and 29. And when analysts discuss the country\u2019s suicide rates, among the world\u2019s highest, they often cite the extreme level of stress caused by the exam. But suneung endures. In past years, while the rest of the country would fall silent on suneung day, early morning scenes in front of school-turned-test-sites could be raucous. As students arrived bundled up against the cold, junior high school students would chant slogans, unfurl placards, beat drums and hand out sticky rice taffy called \u201cyeot\u201d \u2014 all for good luck. Such scenes have all but vanished this year because of social distancing rules. As elsewhere, school life in South Korea has been thrown off balance, with health officials placing limits on the number of students allowed into the classroom or closing schools altogether and switching to online instruction as the outbreaks raged and subsided. On Thursday, mothers silently accompanied their children to the test sites, hugging them and whispering, \u201cGood luck!\u201d at the gates. Fathers held rosaries as they prayed at school walls. For those who finish the exams, the official test results will come out on Dec. 23. But students can get an inkling of how well \u2014 or poorly \u2014 they have done as soon as they leave the test site. A government website reveals preliminary answers to all the questions as soon as each section of the nine-hour exam is completed.",

    "article_text": "1 Percent of P.P.P. Borrowers Got Over One-Quarter of the Loan Money The Paycheck Protection Program was the centerpiece of the federal government\u2019s relief efforts to keep millions of small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. But new data shows what many had suspected all along: The money was shared unevenly, with the biggest sums going to a sliver of the companies in need. Detailed loan information released by the Small Business Administration late on Tuesday showed that a mere 1 percent of the program\u2019s 5.2 million borrowers \u2014 those seeking $1.4 million and above \u2014 received more than a quarter of the $523 billion disbursed. About 600 businesses \u2014 including powerful law firms like Boies Schiller Flexner, restaurants like the steakhouse chain started by Ted Turner, as well as the operator of New York\u2019s biggest horse tracks \u2014 received the maximum loan amount of $10 million, according to the data. It was the first full accounting of how federal money was spent through the program. Aimed at small companies \u2014 generally those with 500 or fewer workers \u2014 the program provided forgivable loans to desperate business owners who were faced with widespread shutdowns. But the program allowed businesses to take enough money to cover only a couple of months\u2019 expenses, and it has come under criticism for its poorly defined rules and a hasty and haphazard rollout that allowed fraudsters to tap into the money, which will take years of litigation to sort out. The newly released data also includes details of loans made under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan system, a longstanding Small Business Administration program that was vastly expanded to offer relief to businesses affected by the pandemic. Together, the two programs spread more than $700 billion to struggling companies in just a few months. The loan data was released under an order by Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, who rejected the S.B.A.\u2019s request to keep the information confidential. Previously released data on the paycheck program contained only ranges for larger loan amounts, and no information about loans under $150,000. Calling the program \u201cvast in both size and sweep,\u201d Judge Boasberg wrote in a ruling last month that \u201cthe weighty public interest in disclosure easily overcomes the far narrower privacy interest of borrowers who collectively received billions of taxpayer dollars in loans.\u201d Share of loans distributed, by amount 100% of loans 75 92% of loans were $250,000 or smaller. 50 25 Only about 1% of  loans were over  $1.5 million. 0 Loan  amount: $500  thousand $1 million $1.5 Share of money distributed, by loan amount 100% of money distributed 75 50 Loans over $1.5 million made up over 25% of the total amount given out. 25 0 Loan  amount: $500  thousand $1 million $1.5 Share of loans distributed, by amount Share of money distributed, by loan amount 100% of loans 100% of money distributed 75 92% of loans were $250,000 or smaller. 50 Loans over $1.5 million made up over 25% of the total amount given out. 25 Only about 1% of  loans were over  $1.5 million. 0 Loan  amount: $500  thousand $1 million $1.5 $0 $500  thousand $1 million $1.5 Note: The largest possible amount a business can be loaned via the Paycheck Protection Program is $10 million. Source: Small Business Administration With virus case counts rising rapidly and public health experts predicting a dark winter ahead, small businesses remain fearful about their survival. Many have used up their allotted aid, which was intended to cover up to two months of payroll costs and a handful of other expenses. Many owners say they would immediately apply for additional funds if available, but the rules permit only a single loan, and there has been little movement toward breaking a monthslong stalemate in Washington over additional aid. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his economic advisers have urged quick action on additional stimulus measures. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed a stopgap plan to extend lapsed federal unemployment benefits until March \u2014 although at a lower rate \u2014 and provide $288 billion to help small businesses, restaurants and theaters. Top Democrats in Congress endorsed the proposal as the basis for further negotiations. The companies that received the maximum $10 million P.P.P. loan include dozens of restaurant chains such as Ted\u2019s Montana Grill, which was started by Mr. Turner; TGI Fridays; P.F. Chang\u2019s; Black Angus Steakhouse; and Legal Sea Foods. They took advantage of an exception the restaurant industry lobbied for to make chains eligible for the aid money. The New York Racing Association, which operates Aqueduct Racetrack, Saratoga Race Course and Belmont Park, the home of the Belmont Stakes, also received the maximum loan. Prominent law firms like Boies Schiller Flexner, the high-priced firm run by David Boies, and Kasowitz Benson Torres, founded and run by President Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, also collected loans for $10 million. (It was previously known that both firms received large loans, but the exact amount had not been disclosed.) Boeis Schiller did not respond to a message seeking comment; Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s firm referred to a previous statement saying the loan helped it preserve hundreds of jobs. Most of the program\u2019s borrowers sought far less: Loans of $150,000 and under accounted for around 87 percent of the loans made through the program, which ended in August, when its congressional authorization expired. But those loans made up less than 30 percent of the total handed out, about $146 billion.  The data shows how federal money flowed to tenants of Mr. Trump\u2019s properties, like 40 Wall Street, a commercial skyscraper in Lower Manhattan. Nearly 100 businesses listing an address in that building collected loans totaling more than $34 million. The largest loan in the building went to Atane Engineers, a contractor that changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated when two former top executives pleaded guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts. The company, which pays $2.5 million a year for its rent at 40 Wall, received a $7.6 million loan, which it said supported 235 workers. The firm did not respond to messages seeking comment. The data also reveals how inconsistently the Small Business Administration disbursed money through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan, a still-running aid effort that offers companies and nonprofits low-interest loans directly from the government. That program is supposed to make loans of up to $2 million, but the S.B.A., concerned that it would run out of money, imposed various caps, none of which were publicly disclosed to borrowers at the time. Two organizations received loans in early April for more than $500,000, the cap the agency set on the program later that month. The Jewish Community Center in Stamford, Conn., received $900,000 and the CWC Group, a chiropractic clinic in Bellevue, Wash., received $713,900, according to government data. The low-interest loan, which has to be repaid, was a lifeline for CWC, said Dr. Sean Kim, the owner of the practice, which does business under the name Blue Spring Chiropractic. Its sales have declined by as much as 70 percent in some months since the pandemic began, he said, and the loan helped him retain 16 employees and contractors. \u201cThis is about survival,\u201d Dr. Kim said. \u201cWithout it, we would not be sleeping well.\u201d (The Jewish Community Center did not respond to questions about its loan.) More than 8,000 organizations got loans for $500,000, a limit that was later lowered to $150,000, where it has remained since May. The disaster loan program has distributed 3.6 million loans, totaling $194 billion, since the coronavirus crisis began \u2014 far more than the program had given out in its entire 67-year history. A Small Business Administration spokesman said the agency\u2019s \u201chistorically successful Covid relief loan programs have helped millions of small businesses and tens of millions of American workers when they needed it most.\u201d Lenders collected $18 billion in fees, according to a New York Times analysis of the S.B.A. data. The largest payment went to JPMorgan Chase, which stands to collect just over $1 billion in fees on more than 280,000 loans worth a total of $29 billion. The runner-up is Bank of America, which will earn $947 million in fees on around 343,400 loans worth nearly $26 billion. Both banks have pledged to donate any profits they earn from the program, but executives from each have told analysts that their expenses were so high that there may not be much, if any, left to give after the loans are settled. \u201cWe have committed that net proceeds from the fees will be dedicated to supporting small businesses and the communities and nonprofits we serve,\u201d Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman, said on Wednesday. JPMorgan declined to comment. The Paycheck Protection Program was hastily constructed in late March after Congress passed the $2 trillion CARES Act. The Treasury Department, which called most of the shots on the program, released technical guidance to banks just hours before lending began in April, and the terms shifted many times before the program ended in August. The Treasury Department has issued dozens of changes and clarifications to its rules. The rules initially required businesses to keep nearly all of their employees if they wished to have their loan forgiven, but Congress later softened the requirements to allow many businesses to have their loans eliminated even if they reduced their employee head count. While economists believe the program contributed to job retention in the pandemic\u2019s early months, its effects faded as the money dried up. An analysis by Gusto, a payroll provider for small companies, found that the chances that workers would lose their job at a company that took a P.P.P. loan increased by 25 percent during the week that the loan\u2019s restrictions on job reductions ended. Gusto estimated that 232,000 jobs may have been eliminated as the restrictions expired. \u201cOnce that requirement ends, the head count falls off a cliff,\u201d said Luke Pardue, an economist at Gusto. \u201cIt was designed to be temporary relief, but what we find is that companies really emerged in no better shape. A lot of that is due to the fact that the economy is in no better shape.\u201d Discussions in Congress about further economic stimulus measures have included calls for a second round of P.P.P. loans, this time more narrowly targeted to the hardest-hit businesses. Nearly $140 billion remained unspent when the program expired in August. Lenders and borrowers who already got loans are now working through the next messy stage of the program: getting P.P.P. loans eligible to be forgiven paid off by the government. Most borrowers have until at least mid-2021 to file and many are holding off, hoping that Congress or the incoming Biden administration will simplify what can be a confusing and time-consuming application process. As of Nov. 22, lenders had submitted 595,000 loan forgiveness applications to the S.B.A., representing about 11 percent of the program\u2019s 5.2 million borrowers. The agency said it had made payments to lenders on 367,000 of those loans.",

    "article_text": "What\u2019s Between 30 Million Americans and an Eviction Tsunami? We\u2019ve all been so concerned about the transition on Jan. 20 that many of us have forgotten another critical date for American democracy: Dec. 31. That\u2019s when the federal eviction moratorium \u2014 which has held the pandemic-related eviction tsunami at bay \u2014 expires. After that date, more than 30 million Americans are at risk of losing their homes. Congress must act to stabilize the country\u2019s rental market, prevent widespread displacement and curtail the growing domination of housing by big corporations. More than half of renters pay 30 percent or more of their income on rent, according to the 2019 American Housing Survey, and more than half of lowest-income renter households reported some loss of employment income between mid-March and mid-September. Although CARES money has been flowing to states, which have established various rental assistance programs, all of them are oversubscribed.  \u201cI can\u2019t point to a city that says we\u2019ve got this figured out,\u201d Mary Cunningham, vice president for metropolitan housing and communities policy at the Urban Institute, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s really the role of the federal government to provide. They\u2019re the ones with the ability to match the need.\u201d \u201cCancel rent,\u201d the movement calling for rent strikes, is a useful tactic against the most notorious, fee-gouging corporate landlords. But close to half of the country\u2019s 47.5 million rental units aren\u2019t corporate-owned, as of 2015. These units, typically single-family homes or apartments in smaller multifamily buildings, are owned by individuals with their own mortgages and bills. And the units they rent in their smaller complexes generally cost less. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a Rent and Mortgage Cancellation bill. But that bill, which proposed government reimbursement for landlords and lenders who agree to adhere to fair practices, has been all but ignored. Congress isn\u2019t going to pick up the bag and pay the difference, so widespread canceling of rent is a sure path to displacement: either the landlord will evict, or the landlord will be forced to sell. Cue the vulture investors who have been circling from the start. Private equity entered the pandemic with more \u201cdry powder\u201d than ever before. That\u2019s the industry term for money earmarked for a certain type of investment, like real estate, but not yet invested. It\u2019s money waiting for a great opportunity, one that the Trump administration\u2019s catastrophic management of the pandemic will surely provide. During the last financial crisis, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made millions buying a failed bank that proceeded to foreclose on homeowners using methods that regulators accused of being \u201cunsafe or unsound.\u201d Other private equity funds amassed foreclosed homes and created single-family rental home empires. As the home values recovered, private equity cashed out of the companies, reaping maximum profits. Now those rental companies, like Invitation Homes, which has 80,000 houses concentrated in 17 markets, told investors that it hopes to ramp up acquisitions. As of September, 9 percent of the nation\u2019s 48 million homeowners with mortgages were behind on their housing payments, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey. By late October, close to 6 percent of those with mortgages were in forbearance. Many are house rich and cash poor. Distressed sales are expected, leaving housing stock up for grabs at a time when most Americans cannot afford to take on new mortgages. Black and Latino people, who disproportionately work in service industries most impacted by the pandemic and who were deprived of generational wealth by racist housing policies, are most at risk. The easiest way to prevent distressed sales and corporate acquisitions is to empower individuals. One efficient solution would be a short-term universal basic income for everyone who falls below a certain threshold. The $1,200 stimulus check was that. And the $600 weekly supplement to unemployment insurance was essentially that, too. Both were extremely effective. The majority of recipients used some of that money toward rent or mortgage payments. Because the supplement wasn\u2019t earmarked for housing, it didn\u2019t create openings for landlords or other entities to exploit, and the housing market wasn\u2019t adversely affected. In July, the share of apartment households who didn\u2019t pay rent increased by only roughly one percentage point compared to last year, from 3.4 to 4.3 percent, according to a survey of 11.5 million units. The problem with the supplement was that it was tied to being unemployed, leading some to turn down low-paying or part-time work that paid less. Another viable (and more moderate) plan calls for the government to finance 10-year-long low-interest-rate loans to tenants so that they can pay their accrued back rent. The program, proposed by Gary Painter, director of the U.S.C. Price Center for Social Innovation and the Homelessness Policy Research Institute, ideally would be progressively subsidized and negotiated with landlords. That would mean those with lower incomes who rent modest, lower-cost places would pay a smaller percentage of their accrued rental liability than those with higher incomes who rent fancier places. The key would be to make the application as accessible and easy as possible. \u201cEveryone would be giving up something,\u201d Mr. Painter told me. \u201cThe tenants would have to pay something. Landlords aren\u2019t going to be happy because they\u2019d only get a percentage of the rent. But in the long run, if you had a plan, everyone could negotiate accordingly.\u201d Most critically: For those properties that do hit the market, especially hotel and apartment buildings, we need a government-sponsored affordable housing acquisition fund and legislation that gives it first priority to scoop up properties. The cost of not acting is too high. In 2018, there were only 10 million affordable rentals on the private market and almost 18 million households with very low incomes that needed them. Without government intervention, affordable units are prone to be converted into condos, further vexing the rental situation in cities like Los Angeles, which already have low vacancy rates. Critics and conservatives will cry \u201cmoral hazard!\u201d at the prospect of a universal basic income or financing loans to struggling renters. This is the same complaint that was lodged against bailing out homeowners during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. The government provided a swift and generous bailout to the banks that caused the crisis. But programs to support underwater homeowners, the Home Affordable Modification Program and the Home Affordable Refinance Program, under-delivered: HAMP permanently reduced mortgages for less than half of the recipients the program was intended to help, and HARP initially only helped about a million borrowers. Because there was so much concern that homeowners would cheat the system, loan reduction and modification applications were prohibitively cumbersome. When homes went to foreclosure auction, vulture investors snagged them up at steep discounts. Those who went through foreclosure not only had their lives upended but they have lost trust in the government and, some studies have shown, have been less likely to vote. The housing crisis we face now is fundamentally different from the one in 2008, not the result of spurious new financial instruments, but a sort of natural disaster (and home prices have only gone up, not down). In that sense, it\u2019s easier, if even more costly, to fix. Renters need an outlay of \u201cfederal pandemic insurance,\u201d as Mr. Painter likes to call it. While the eviction moratoriums are still in place, Congress has a choice: prepare a rental recovery program that builds trust or allow mass eviction, displacement, foreclosure, corporate consolidation and increased inequality. It is a choice with repercussions not just for individual citizens, but for the survival of a real democracy.

In the latest example of misinformation about the coronavirus ricocheting across social media, a Nevada doctor\u2019s selfie has been used to spread false claims that downplay the severity of the pandemic. In the picture posted to Twitter on Sunday, the doctor, Jacob Keeperman, is standing at the Renown Regional Medical Center\u2019s alternate care site in Reno, Nev. In the background, empty hospital beds covered in plastic stand in a vacant parking area. The photo was taken on Nov. 12, the day the site opened, so patients had not yet arrived, Renown Health said. \u201cI want to thank all the incredible staff who are Fighting the Good Fight to help all those suffering from COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Keeperman, the medical director for Renown\u2019s Transfer and Operations Center, wrote. \u201cWith 5 deaths in the last 32 hours, everyone is struggling to keep their head up. Stay strong.\u201d His photograph was then used by the account @Networkinvegas to erroneously claim that it showed a \u201cfake hospital\u201d that had \u201cnever seen a single patient.\u201d On Tuesday, President Trump brought that falsehood to a wider audience, retweeting the @Networkinvegas post with the comment: \u201cFake election results in Nevada, also!\u201d Twitter flagged the president\u2019s tweet, noting that the claim about election fraud was \u201cdisputed.\u201d  In fact, the alternate care site in Reno has cared for a total of 219 Covid patients in the three weeks it has been open. And across Nevada, hospitalizations have risen 43 percent in the last 14 days, with a 55 percent increase in deaths, according to a New York Times database.  Dr. Keeperman said in an interview on Wednesday that he was \u201csad and disappointed\u201d to see the attacks surrounding his post on social media. \u201cI sent that tweet to recognize and to thank all of our health care teammates that often go unrecognized,\u201d he said. \u201cMy greatest wish is that I never have to tell another family that their loved one won\u2019t be coming home.\u201d He has received an outpouring of support from local, state and national leaders, from health care colleagues, and from many in the general public \u2014 but he has also received some \u201cless than savory messages,\u201d he said. \u201cI have chosen to ignore those and to keep hope.\u201d In response to the president\u2019s tweet, Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada, a Democrat, said, \u201cHis consistent misleading rhetoric on Covid-19 is dangerous and reckless, and today\u2019s implication that Renown\u2019s alternate care site is a \u2018fake hospital\u2019 is among the worst examples we\u2019ve seen.\u201d Addressing those who maintain that the pandemic is some kind of hoax, Dr. Keeperman said in the interview: \u201cCovid is real. I sure hope that you don\u2019t get sick, but when you do, we\u2019re going to be here to care for you. And we\u2019re going to have a bed for you, and we\u2019re going to do our best. And then you\u2019ll know just how real it is.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Police Break Up 400-Person Party at Long Island Mansion The first calls that police received about an enormous gathering at a castle-like mansion on Long Island came shortly after midnight on Monday, the authorities said. Neighbors reported a suspicious number of cars racing around and vehicles parked bumper-to-bumper on their normally quiet streets. As more reports came in \u2014 including one from the home\u2019s owner, who had rented his property to a guest on Airbnb and discovered the gathering while watching his security cameras from afar \u2014 the police went to the house, a lavish stone building in Brookhaven, N.Y. When they arrived, they found as many as 400 people gathered for a party, officials said, in an explicit violation of New York State\u2019s limits on private gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. The party, held at a gated luxury home owned by a one-time rapper who once hoped to be New York City\u2019s nightlife mayor, was the latest in a string of illicit gatherings in Suffolk County on Long Island. Persuading people to obey state directives and public health guidance has proved challenging for officials, even as a surge of coronavirus cases sweeps across New York. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that an event like this is a public health issue,\u201d said Chief Stuart Cameron of the Suffolk County Police Department at a news conference on Tuesday. For months, elected leaders and officials across the United States have been pleading with residents to avoid indoor gatherings over concern that they had been contributing to an uptick in cases this fall. Though epidemiologists have been less certain that small family get-togethers are the source of infections, a number of state and local governments have established restrictions to limit larger gatherings, some of which have become so-called superspreader events. Last month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo imposed a 10-person limit on all private gatherings in the state. Though a number of sheriffs said they would not enforce the order, especially on Thanksgiving, Suffolk County\u2019s executive said his county\u2019s police department planned to uphold it. For months, Suffolk County, at the eastern end of Long Island, has made news for gatherings both large and small. In July, when the state had just emerged from a crushing wave of the pandemic, more than 2,150 people attended a charity concert featuring the D.J. duo the Chainsmokers. In October, county officials announced a number of parties that they called \u201csuperspreader events,\u201d including a gathering of 200 to 300 people in Farmingville, N.Y. The problem is not exclusive to Long Island. The New York City sheriff\u2019s office has broken up large parties every weekend over the last several months. \u201cI just think there are some people who, despite all of the warnings and the damage that we\u2019ve seen from this virus, don\u2019t think they need to follow the rules and aren\u2019t concerned about others,\u201d Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive, said in an interview on Wednesday. Mr. Bellone added that despite the attention paid to such large events, small gatherings had actually been driving an uptick in cases in Suffolk County since Halloween. Such get-togethers have become the predominant source of spread in the county, he said. Over the last month, Suffolk has seen its positive test rate move from 1.2 percent to 5.2 percent, Mr. Bellone said. Hospitalizations rose from 42 on Nov. 1 to 248 on Dec. 1, and Mr. Bellone said the numbers had started to jump again after Thanksgiving. The party in Brookhaven particularly stood out, he said, both because of its size and because it was hosted not by the homeowner, but by an out-of-state visitor who had rented the house on Airbnb. Officials were still trying to identify the person responsible for the party, who they believed was from New Jersey, the police said. Investigators did not yet know if the person who rented the Airbnb was the person who threw the party. A Suffolk County police spokeswoman said that charges had not yet been filed on Wednesday morning. Officials believed the party was a \u201chigh-end\u201d affair, with most attendees in their 30s or 40s, Mr. Bellone said. The police who reported to the scene said that many of the cars parked nearby were luxury vehicles or sports cars. When the police arrived at the home, a 5,000-square-foot stone building situated on nearly 10 acres on a dead-end street, the party\u2019s attendees followed orders to disperse, Chief Cameron said. But because of the sheer number of people in attendance, the police were on the scene for close to four hours as they tried to clear every guest, he said. The department\u2019s aviation, emergency service and canine units were all involved, he said. Despite violating the ban on gatherings, none of the party\u2019s attendees received summonses, the police spokeswoman said. Officials were also not planning to file any charges against the homeowner, who Chief Cameron said had cooperated with the investigation and had offered proof that he had told the person renting the house about the gathering limit. The owner became aware of the gathering through cameras that were installed at the house, Mr. Bellone said. One of the guests appeared to have tried to disable the cameras so the party would escape notice, he added. An Airbnb listing for the house appeared to have been removed on Wednesday morning. But a similar listing on Tripadvisor advertised the home as an \u201cabsolutely majestic castle\u201d with 11-foot ceilings and a 15-foot bar. The rate for a three-night stay is $1,872, and the listing notes that any parties and events must be discussed in advance.  The police did not name the home\u2019s owner, but tax records identified him as Matthew Demar. Mr. Demar did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Newsday, he was a rapper in the 1990s who used the name Kid Panic and is a former radio DJ. In 2016, he released a song in support of President Trump titled \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Newsday reported. A video for the song, which has more than 200,000 views on YouTube, shows Mr. Demar dressed in a suit and rapping in various places around New York City. The following year, Mr. Demar appeared in a YouTube video expressing his interest in becoming New York City\u2019s nightlife mayor, in which he called himself one of the first white rappers. The home, at 51 Hawkins Lane, is currently listed for sale at $949,999 and has repeatedly moved on and off the market since 2014, according to Zillow. Mr. Demar purchased it in 2009, property records show.",

    "article_text": "Why the U.K. Approved a Coronavirus Vaccine First LONDON \u2014 The first rigorously tested coronavirus vaccine was given a green light for use on Wednesday in Britain. Doses of the vaccine, made by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a small German company, BioNTech, will be injected starting next week, the government said. In leaping ahead of the United States to allow mass inoculations, Britain added to the pressure on American drug regulators, who were summoned to the White House on Tuesday by President Trump\u2019s chief of staff to explain why they were not ready to do the same. The two countries vet vaccines differently. Rather than accepting the findings of vaccine makers, American regulators painstakingly reanalyze raw data from the trials to validate the results, poring over what regulators have described as thousands of pages of documents. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on Tuesday that the F.D.A. \u201cis one of the few regulatory agencies in the world that actually looks at the raw data.\u201d Regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe lean more heavily on companies\u2019 own analyses. Instead of sifting through raw trial data and crunching the numbers themselves, regulatory agencies often will study a drugmaker\u2019s reports and, unless there are anomalies, ground their decisions in company-provided documents. The question of whether Britain had authorized a vaccine in haste, or the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 1,500 Americans a day, provoked a spirited debate among scientists and industry experts on Wednesday. European regulators said that Britain\u2019s authorization was so limited that it only applied to specific batches of the vaccine, a claim that Pfizer denied, and that British officials did not address. Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the F.D.A.\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, said in an interview on Wednesday that regulators\u2019 success in approving vaccines, while minimizing unforeseen errors, justified a rigorous approach. \u201cThat we\u2019ve been able to get on top of viruses with such a minimal amount of casualties is remarkable,\u201d he said, adding that American regulators were only days away from finishing their own review. The F.D.A. has scheduled a meeting of an independent panel of experts for Dec. 10 to review Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. British regulators seek opinions from a specialist committee, too, but that group has the flexibility to review data and meet as it needs to, allowing it to move more quickly. \u201cIn the U.K., they\u2019ve just been able to say, \u2018We have the data, we\u2019re having the meeting,\u2019\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. To speed the process, Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency had its experts review vaccine data as it became available, and separate teams worked in parallel on different parts of the process, rather than one waiting for another to finish. \u201cIf you\u2019re climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare,\u201d Dr. June Raine, the agency\u2019s chief executive, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe started that in June.\u201d When early results arrived on Nov. 10, she said, \u201cWe were at base camp.\u201d And later, she said, \u201cWhen we got the final analysis, we were ready for that last sprint.\u201d Britain broke from the European Union\u2019s regulatory orbit to approve a vaccine early, owing to emergency powers that the bloc gives countries in the case of a pandemic. Once Britain consummates its split from the European Union on Dec. 31, those powers to approve vaccines on its own will become permanent. The countries that remain in the European Union are waiting for its regulator, the European Medicines Agency, to authorize a vaccine. Like the F.D.A., the European regulator has scheduled a Dec. 29 meeting to consult outside experts and offer an opinion on the Pfizer vaccine. The agency\u2019s job is complicated by its obligation to solicit the views of all 27 E.U. countries. That process has been accelerated during the pandemic, but it will still take several days for countries to weigh in after the meeting, which is likely to delay vaccinations until early January. Pfizer plans to ship 800,000 doses to Britain in the coming days. Starting Tuesday night, those doses were being prepared for shipping at a factory in Puurs, Belgium, BioNTech said. The doses will be packaged in boxes, with dry ice keeping them at the South Pole-like temperatures they require, before they are put on trucks or planes and taken to Britain. They will arrive in government distribution warehouses by the weekend, Pfizer said on Wednesday. British hospitals have already begun emailing staff members to schedule vaccinations, with a London hospital system indicating that its first doses will be given at 7 a.m. on Monday. Britain placed advance orders for 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine but most of those are expected to be administered next year. Each patient needs two, a month apart. A government advisory body released its list of vaccine priority groups on Wednesday. At the top of the list are nursing home residents and workers, followed by people older than 80 and health and social care workers. In practice, though, government officials said on Wednesday that, because of the difficulties of storing and moving the Pfizer vaccine, they would initially restrict vaccinations to a network of 50 hospitals. As a result, nurses, doctors, nursing home staff and people age 80 or over who had scheduled appointments would be first in line for the vaccine, ahead of nursing home residents. Pfizer has said that the vaccine can survive for five days in a normal refrigerator. But Britain\u2019s National Health Service still has to consider issues like staffing at non-hospital sites and transport difficulties within the country in deciding how to administer the vaccine. The National Health Service has roughly 150,000 doctors and more than 330,000 nurses and midwives. The British decision will not in itself bring vaccinations closer anywhere else. But Pfizer executives said on Wednesday that they had already heard from other countries that, in light of Britain\u2019s go-ahead, were looking to accelerate their own approval processes. American regulators, despite months of pressure from Mr. Trump, have maintained that they will follow their plan and review Pfizer\u2019s vaccine to the F.D.A.\u2019s standards. The United States has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most of its supply will come from a separate factory in Kalamazoo, Mich. Still, many questions remain about how vaccine makers like Pfizer will fulfill the orders of wealthier nations that have procured supplies in advance.",

    "article_text": "Moderna Plans to Begin Testing Its Coronavirus Vaccine in Children The drugmaker Moderna said on Wednesday that it would soon begin testing its coronavirus vaccine in children ages 12 through 17. The study, listed Wednesday on the website clinicaltrials.gov, is to include 3,000 children, with half receiving two shots of vaccine four weeks apart, and half getting placebo shots of salt water. But the posting says the study is \u201cnot yet recruiting,\u201d and Colleen Hussey, a spokeswoman for Moderna, said it was not certain when the testing sites would be listed or start accepting volunteers. A link on the website to test centers is not yet working, and Ms. Hussey said she was not sure when it would become active. Moderna announced on Monday that data from its study in 30,000 adults had found its vaccine to be 94.1 percent effective, and that it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin vaccinating adults. If approval is granted, certain groups of high-risk adults, including people in nursing homes, could receive shots late in December. But no vaccine can be widely given to children until it has been tested in them. Vaccines meant for both adults and children are generally tested first in adults to help make sure they are safe for pediatric trials. Moderna\u2019s vaccine has not yet been studied in children or pregnant women. In the new clinical trial in adolescents, girls past puberty will be tested before each injection to make sure they are not pregnant. \u201cEveryone anticipates that when we test this first in adolescents, then older children, then the real small kids, that the Covid vaccine will work,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser on vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But children have more active immune systems than adults, and may have stronger reactions, including more fever, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue, Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cThey may be more out of sorts than adults for a day or two,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really do want to know, if it\u2019s given in adolescents, what can parents expect? You really want to be able to tell them clearly how you might feel for 24 or 48 hours after you receive the vaccine. And obviously, we really want to be able to tell parents it works.\u201d If a child had intense side effects and parents were not prepared for it, they might be reluctant to go back for the second shot, Dr. Schaffner said. Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that vaccines \u201cfor the most part\u201d work equally well in children and adults. Occasionally, as with the hepatitis B vaccine, different doses are required, he said. Moderna will study the same dose in children that it has tested in adults. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Pfizer began testing its coronavirus vaccine in children as young as 12 in October. A large clinical trial found its vaccine to be 95 percent effective in adults, and the company has requested emergency authorization from the F.D.A. Britain approved the Pfizer vaccine for adults on Wednesday, the first country to do so. AstraZeneca has also tested its vaccine in children, but not in the United States. As vaccine studies have moved forward, rumors have spread on social media, particularly among people who oppose vaccines in general, that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to require vaccination for everyone, including children. His team has denied those claims, and Mr. Biden has said that he will rely on scientists\u2019 advice for the best way to end the pandemic.",

    "article_text": "Do We Need Football in America This Badly? Yes, we need joyful distractions in times of trouble. And yes, the N.F.L. has long served that need more than any other American sport. But it\u2019s not worth it at this cost. Not with players, coaches and staff across the league getting infected with the coronavirus by the dozens. Not as the virus spirals out of control across the country, causing Dr. Anthony Fauci to predict that \u201cDecember, January and early February are going to be terribly painful months.\u201d All sports are trying to plow through this worsening stage of the pandemic, arguing their economics are so dire that there is no other option. College basketball limps along, chasing the financial windfall of March Madness. The N.B.A. is planning to start another season this month, and the N.H.L. is scheduled to begin in January. Baseball remains committed to opening next spring. But football is different. It has far larger teams and the games have never been played in the kind of tightly controlled \u201cbubble\u201d environments that basketball and hockey used at the end of last season to keep the outbreaks to a minimum. College football, as I\u2019ve written, was foolish to move forward knowing teams would play in an environment that was impossible to control. Its schedule is full of games halted by the virus. Many of its players, who help rake in millions for their schools but don\u2019t have the benefit of union protection and labor laws, have had positive tests. Now, pro football, which helped set the tone for a return to sports because of its vast popularity, is an utter mess. So much so that it is simply time for the N.F.L. to press pause, regroup and rethink its approach. Of the league\u2019s 32 teams, all but one, the Seattle Seahawks, have been hit by the virus. The outbreaks began piling up almost from the start, as N.F.L. teams began flying across the country for games, some of them playing in stadiums with a limited number of fans. In October, two dozen Tennessee Titans became infected, causing the first of what has become a string of postponements. The N.F.L. looks like it is running a circus. Among the latest lowlights: A marquee game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers, scheduled for Thanksgiving Day, was postponed to Sunday after several Ravens players tested positive, including the league\u2019s reigning most valuable player, Lamar Jackson. As the number of infected players began piling up, the league moved the game to Tuesday. Then the league rescheduled the game again, this time for Wednesday afternoon. Why not play at night, giving players who have barely practiced in recent days more time to prepare, decreasing their risk of injury? The scheduling decision hinged on television, the league\u2019s cash cow. NBC, which will broadcast the game, wanted to stick with its plans to air the tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center during a two-hour prime-time special. On the West Coast, the league didn\u2019t look any better. The San Francisco 49ers will play their next two home games at the Arizona Cardinals\u2019 Stadium, near Phoenix. That last-minute, jury-rigged plan came about after officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., where the 49ers\u2019 stadium is, wisely decided to ban contact sports through late December in a bid to stem the virus surge wreaking havoc in large parts of the state. But there is a problem: State Farm Stadium is in Maricopa County, Ariz., which has had an average daily rate of 42.7 cases per 100,000 residents in the past week \u2014 well above the alarming rate of 29.5 cases per 100,000 residents in Santa Clara County. The change of venues only makes sense for a league trying to keep a troubled season going, not from the standpoint of public health. The league was making things up on the fly, the same as it has done all season. \u201cIt seems like they didn\u2019t have a plan for what to do once people started testing positive,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health and Security, when we spoke this week. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of flying by the seat of their pants, trying to figure out how to actually finish the season.\u201d Remaining on the current path is a fool\u2019s errand, added Eric Topol, a coronavirus expert and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research. Trying to play without the benefit of an N.B.A.-style restricted environment, he said, \u201cis an exercise not just in futility, but in danger.\u201d Agreed. It would be better to pause the season now, retool the health protocols and wait out the coming storm. If the virus recedes to controllable levels by the early part of 2021, resume with a shortened playoff and a Super Bowl \u2014 ditching the current plan to allow fans in the stands at that game. An even wiser option: End the season now. Fans won\u2019t like it. Players and coaches will balk. A league with teams worth billions of dollars will talk about how it can\u2019t afford to miss out on the television revenue. But it has come to this: For the sake of us all, stop play. Prepare instead for a return in the fall of 2021, when a vaccine has a chance to help life return to something close to normal. Why not? Are N.F.L. games essential? Hardly. Are teams based in communities brimming with infection? Indeed. Do virus-infected players and staff members, even the ones who look and feel fine, add fuel to the fire in each of those communities? You bet. It is possible to love the N.F.L. and stand against the arguments for continuing the patchwork approach heralded by football enablers fixated on profits. For too long, they\u2019ve normalized the threat. The persistent risks of the virus \u2014 including possible damage to the heart and other organs \u2014 are rarely discussed. Positive test results get discussed as if Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, is akin to a sprained ankle for young athletes. In a September column, as the season got underway, I posed hard questions. Is the return of our country\u2019s most popular sport sending a false alert that we have almost conquered the virus? Is the N.F.L. joining in the deadly and premature message that we\u2019re back, we can do what we want and the ordinary days of old are just around the bend? It\u2019s well worth thinking about such questions once again. The death toll stood at 193,700 when I wrote that column. Think of that. All the grandparents, mothers, fathers, children, neighbors. Two months later, roughly 77,000 more have perished. That\u2019s the equivalent of everyone at a packed Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, gone. It is time to rethink our whole approach to this scourge. The N.F.L. would be an excellent place to start.",

Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign manager who was demoted in July, claimed in a Fox News interview on Tuesday night that President Trump would have handily won the election if he had expressed more empathy about the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe lost suburban families,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cI think that goes to one thing: the decision on Covid to go for opening the economy versus public empathy.\u201d He added, \u201cI think if he had been publicly empathetic, he would have won.\u201d Mr. Parscale also appeared to blame those who succeeded him in running Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for failing to file lawsuits before Election Day. In fact, the campaign filed multiple lawsuits during the early voting period seeking to block mail-in ballot rule changes. \u201cI wanted lawyers everywhere,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cWhy, during the early voting days, why weren\u2019t they already getting in there and filing lawsuits? Why are we doing it post?\u201d At other points in the interview, Mr. Parscale refused to concede that the president had lost the election, claiming that Mr. Trump was \u201cin a position that he might be able to pull this off.\u201d  Mr. Parscale has kept a low profile since September, when he was hospitalized after his wife, Candice, called the police saying he was in his house with guns and threatening to hurt himself. According to a police report, Ms. Parscale also said her husband had bruised her arms during \u201da physical altercation.\u201d She later walked back the claim of domestic abuse. Since that episode, which was caught on police body camera footage, Mr. Parscale has claimed he wants to go back to a simpler, more private life flipping real estate. He has told friends he wants to leave politics. Current and former Trump officials on Tuesday interpreted Mr. Parscale\u2019s re-emergence as an attempt to increase the value of a memoir he is also trying to sell and to ingratiate himself with the president. Mr. Parscale said in the Fox interview that he had not spoken to Mr. Trump recently, and that the fracturing of their relationship was \u201cpretty hurtful.\u201d \u201cI gave every inch of my life to them,\u201d he said of the Trump family. \u201cEvery inch.\u201d At another point in the interview, he claimed that he was a \u201csemi-quasi campaign manager\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s winning 2016 campaign, alongside Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. In fact, Kellyanne Conway, a former White House official, was the president\u2019s campaign manager four years ago. \u201cThe worst thing to ever do was to break us two up,\u201d Mr. Parscale said of his relationship with Mr. Kushner, claiming that the president\u2019s son-in-law was also \u201cslightly sidelined\u201d after his demotion. Addressing the altercation in September for the first time, Mr. Parscale hinted at strains in his marriage but did not address the abuse allegation. Martha MacCallum, the Fox News host who conducted the interview, did not ask him about it. \u201cWe lost two children during the election,\u201d Mr. Parscale said, referring to the death of their twins in 2016. \u201cWe were completely attacked by the left, the right, the media. And I got to a bad place.\u201d He said that he and his wife had \u201cnever been happier,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I moved on.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Dr. Michael Davidson, Who Studied Infectious Disease, Dies at 77 This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Dr. Michael Davidson, an epidemiologist who pursued a career focused on infectious disease in part because of the death of his grandparents during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, died on Nov. 8 in Anchorage. He was 77. His death, of Covid-19 at Providence Hospital, was confirmed by Dr. James Sprott, a close friend. Dr. Davidson\u2019s maternal grandparents died of the flu within a week of each other, orphaning their five children. That tragic family history affected Dr. Davidson deeply. A week before he tested positive for the coronavirus, he told a longtime friend, Dr. John Finley, that he would have relished the chance to be part of the effort to end the pandemic. But he had already retired, shortly after a biking accident in 2003 left him a quadriplegic. Dr. Davidson worked with the U.S. Public Health Service, the Alaska Native Medical Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Anchorage. He conducted pivotal studies on cardiovascular health and infectious diseases among Native Alaskans. He also studied pneumonia, H.I.V. and the human papillomavirus, or H.P.V., and helped confirm that H.P.V. can trigger cervical cancer. Throughout his career, he traveled to remote parts of the world to further his research and provide medical training. He was a visiting fellow in 1993 at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, focusing on pneumonia. In the 1980s, he traveled to Peshawar, Pakistan, to create a paramedic training program for Afghan refugees. An avid outdoorsman who loved to cook, Dr. Davidson ran marathons, hiked in the desert, cross-country skied in the backcountry between remote Alaskan villages, and rafted white-water rivers. He was badly injured in a biking accident shortly after he relocated to New Jersey for a new job heading up an H.I.V./AIDS research team for Roche Pharmaceuticals. \u201cHe had two real loves in life: the outdoors and cooking,\u201d Dr. Sprott said in an interview. Dr. Davidson honed his culinary skills by trying every recipe in the 24-volume \u201cTime-Life Foods of the World\u201d cookbook collection. For the past 10 years, he had required round-the-clock home care. \u201cHe drove his aides crazy, telling them how to cook, but they could never do it like he did,\u201d Dr. Sprott said. A lover of jazz and the blues, Dr. Davidson also played the saxophone. Michael Davidson was born on April 8, 1943, in Greensburg, Pa., outside Pittsburgh, to Peter and Selma Davidson, who owned a men\u2019s clothing store in Greensburg and later in Meadville, in northwest Pennsylvania, where Dr. Davidson grew up. His older sister, Paula, a nurse, died at a young age. He earned a degree in biology in 1965 at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., and received his medical degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1969. He spent a summer while in medical school on a Navajo reservation studying the high prevalence of gallstones among the people there, Dr. Thomas Welty, a friend and medical school classmate, said. The experience inspired Dr. Davidson to work with Indigenous people in Alaska, he said. Dr. Davidson completed his internal medicine training at George Washington and Georgetown Universities, and had a fellowship in infectious disease at the University of New Mexico, where he later taught while running a private practice in internal medicine. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public health in 1983 and, in 1999, a doctorate in clinical epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University. He also taught at the biomedical program at the University of Alaska. Dr. Davidson leaves no immediate survivors.",

Jerome H. Powell, the Fed Chair, pointed to ongoing uncertainty over vaccine speed and distribution, the economic dangers of a surge in virus cases, and the grim reality that many remain out of work. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s testimony painted a sunnier image of the economic recovery, emphasizing state and local lockdowns as the main threat to growth.

    "article_text": "Pantyhose and Trash Bags: How Music Programs Are Surviving in the Pandemic In 13 years of playing flute, Gabriella Alvarez never imagined playing with a clear plastic trash bag around her instrument. Kevin Vigil never foresaw his fellow tuba players wrapping pantyhose around their instrument bells. And neither expected to watch their marching band at New Mexico State University play through cloth face masks, separated by six-foot loops of water pipe, with bags filled with hand sanitizer and disinfectant strapped around their waists. But this is band practice in a pandemic. The two students, both seniors, are grateful to have practice at all. In March, the coronavirus shut down their band along with much of the country, painfully demonstrating that the pandemic would leave no part of their education untouched. It would take five months for them to regain the precious ability to play together again. \u201cIn the middle of this summer, I started playing my instrument alone and sat there crying because I was just so upset,\u201d Ms. Alvarez, 22, said. \u201cMaking music with other people is part of why I do it.\u201d In dozens of interviews, students and educators described similar travails \u2014 and similar adaptations \u2014 in music programs across the country. In many districts, schools have paused their music programs or moved them online out of concerns that aerosol transmission of the coronavirus during band or chorus practices would turn them into superspreader events. Those bands and orchestras that have moved their programs online often found that ordinary video chat platforms are inadequate because of audio lag. And students have said there is simply no substitute for in-person practices, performances and instruction. Even in small group or private lesson via webcam, the details of proper posture, pitch and rhythm are lost, they said. Ms. Alvarez, who is studying music performance, lost the one-on-one guidance she needed to prepare for auditions with professional orchestras. Mr. Vigil\u2019s first student teaching position, critical for the degree in music education he is seeking, was canceled. Rather than risk entering a job market ravaged by the virus, both chose to postpone graduation. Unable to introduce music to children during their formative years, teachers fear a lasting drop in participation that could wipe out much of the next generation of musicians. \u201cIf children and even college students can\u2019t participate in music, it\u2019s going to create such a void and it\u2019s going to reverberate for a long time,\u201d said Mark J. Spede, president of the College Band Directors National Association. Instead of ensemble music, some programs have been teaching music history or theory, or having students submit videos of themselves playing their instruments that are incorporated into collages that make it seem as if they are performing together. But creating such collages requires resources that many schools cannot afford. At North Kansas City High School in Missouri, where the governor has slashed the education budget, the band director Carrie Epperson has only half of last year\u2019s funds, and she is still waiting on bell covers her school district promised to send to wind instrumentalists. Nevertheless, mask wearing and strict social distancing seem to have worked: no band members have tested positive for the coronavirus. Brenna Ohrmundt is the band director for a small, low-income district in rural Wisconsin, where coronavirus cases have skyrocketed in recent weeks. When schools shuttered in March, many students did not have instruments at home. When they returned to classrooms this fall, they still were not allowed to play together. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is, students are going to say, \u2018This is not what I signed up for,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ohrmundt said. Yet, at a time when students could be discouraged from continuing to study music, educators are finding innovative ways for them to play together safely. Mr. Spede, who is also director of bands at Clemson University, recognized early on that educators did not know which music activities might be safe. He initiated a study in which researchers at the University of Colorado and the University of Maryland have been measuring the spread of aerosols when people sing, dance or play instruments. \u201cMy biggest fear was that people, administrators, whoever were going to have a knee-jerk reaction and say that can\u2019t possibly be safe, to play music in person,\u201d Mr. Spede said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with the study is, literally, save music.\u201d Preliminary results from the study show that some simple rules can help prevent the virus from spreading in music groups: mask wearing, even if that entails cutting a hole in it to play an instrument; covering the bell of brass instruments, such as trumpets, with nylon (pantyhose work); and practicing outdoors where possible, or in properly ventilated areas. \u201cEven that information gives people hope right now, which we desperately need,\u201d said Rebecca Phillips, president of the National Band Association and the director of bands at Colorado State University. Ms. Alvarez cried tears of joy and relief on the day in August when New Mexico State\u2019s marching band reunited. Steven Smyth, the university\u2019s associate director of bands, worked all summer with faculty and students to put into place safety measures. Practice is now always outdoors. To enforce social distancing, Mr. Smyth designed six-foot \u201chula hoops\u201d made of water pipes that encircle each musician. He recruited a flute player who is studying engineering to customize masks with slits that snap shut magnetically for the woodwind players. Nylon bell covers were ordered for brass players. And, following another recommendation from the study, brass players must empty \u201cspit valves,\u201d a tap that drains condensation from inside the instrument, onto absorptive puppy pee pads. \u201cThere was a lot of negativity going around,\u201d Ms. Alvarez said. \u201cBut once those masks came out, a lot of people started saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re coming back. This is happening.\u2019\u201d Mr. Smyth said this week that the marching band had not had a student test positive for the coronavirus. Nationally, the College Band Directors National Association reports that no infections among college band students have been attributed to band activities, Mr. Spede said. \u201cI feel a little bit safer just knowing that there are a lot of people fighting to keep the arts alive,\u201d Mr. Vigil said. Other schools have used similarly creative measures. Villanova University ordered goggles for their marching band after researchers in China found fewer virus cases among people with glasses, suggesting that eye protection could reduce spread of the virus. At West Chester University, plexiglass walls separate instructors from students in private lessons. The Northern Virginia Community College campus in Annandale, Va., is home to a thriving symphony orchestra, open to students and members of the community. Despite having fewer resources and a smaller music department than most universities, it has the support of Reunion Music Society, a local nonprofit group that helped it reach record enrollment this year. \u201cThis orchestra would not exist without community involvement,\u201d said Ralph Brooker, president of Reunion Music Society and principal cellist in the orchestra. Updated Dec. 7, 2020 The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education. This fall, the conductor, Christopher Johnston, has been organizing about 50 active orchestra members, who include older musicians, into small groups. Some rehearse six feet apart in carports and church parking lots, but most use JamKazam, a video chat platform that allows musicians to see and hear each other in real time. The technology is imperfect. At a jazz group meeting, JamKazam kept booting Mr. Johnston off the call. The musicians turned to Zoom, where audio lag caused the individual parts of \u201cMy Funny Valentine\u201d to trip drunkenly over each other. The song was barely recognizable, but the musicians grinned in their little onscreen boxes \u2014 the thrill of playing together had not been dampened. \u201cThere is therapy in getting together with other musicians.\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cIt\u2019s helping us cope with all of the negative byproducts of this time, one of which is loneliness.\u201d Safety measures have gone far to reassure students and educators. Results from a survey distributed this fall show that participation in school and community bands has held steady since last year, according to James Weaver, director of performing arts with the National Federation of State High School Associations. Though about 200 of the more than 2,000 band programs surveyed are currently \u201cfrozen,\u201d only four education-based bands were canceled outright. Musicians at every level say that those who were passionate about a career in music before the pandemic are only more motivated now. Ms. Alvarez plans to get a master\u2019s degree in music performance after she graduates. Mr. Vigil, who aspires to teach music at the college level, has leaned into his leadership role with the marching band. In Wisconsin, Ms. Ohrmundt spent weeks hand-sewing masks, soliciting donations of bell covers and scrounging up pillowcases that woodwind players could wrap around their instruments \u2014 all in hopes of gathering her high school band in the gym for its first practice in months. But a surge in the virus has postponed in-person activities into next year. In Missouri, Nevaeh Diaz, who graduated from North Kansas City High School in May, is now studying music education at Missouri State University. In playing the drums in high school, Ms. Diaz had found a healthy outlet for her anxiety and depression. And during the pandemic, she leaned even more on her band director, Ms. Epperson, who personally delivered one of the school\u2019s expensive marimbas to Ms. Diaz\u2019s home for a virtual scholarship audition. Now she looks at Ms. Epperson as a model for the high school band director she aims to become. \u201cI\u2019m not here for the money, I\u2019m here to change a life,\u201d Ms. Diaz said. \u201cIf I can be the teacher to the student that Epp was for me, then I will do that.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Only 9 Trials in 9 Months: Virus Wreaks Havoc on N.Y.C. Courts A Brooklyn trial was postponed after the defense lawyers said they were unwilling to spend weeks inside a cramped courtroom. In Manhattan, a woman summoned for jury duty told the court she had been sick with the coronavirus and was symptomatic. Another trial, in the Bronx, was canceled when four courthouse staff members tested positive. Since October, state and federal court officials have taken extraordinary measures to restart criminal trials in New York City. They have constructed plexiglass boxes with special air filters in court. They have asked witnesses to testify in face shields and have spread jurors out in courtroom galleries. But those efforts have not stopped the virus from disrupting nearly every step of the process. The state and federal courts in the city have been able to complete only nine criminal jury trials since the pandemic hit in March, officials said. Last year, there were about 800 criminal trials in the city. For months, the logistical problems have threatened the ability of hundreds of defendants to secure their constitutional right to a speedy trial. Now, as a second wave of the virus threatens the region, the delays are only worsening \u2014 and officials foresee the backlog of unresolved cases continuing to grow. Last month, the chief judge in New York State halted new jury trials until further notice because of surging virus cases. More than 400 defendants have been waiting inside New York City jails for over two years for their cases to be resolved, according to the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cIs it fair for people to be languishing in pretrial detention and presumed innocent with no prospect of a trial in the future for them?\u201d said New York\u2019s chief administrative judge, Lawrence K. Marks. \u201cA criminal justice system cannot be, in any sense of the word, fully functioning, if it is not conducting jury trials.\u201d And in the past week, the federal courts in the city also announced that all trials would be suspended until mid-January. Some prosecutors, citing safety concerns, have pushed to delay trials because their witnesses live out of state or work in hospitals with Covid-19 patients. In other cases, prosecutors said the fears of catching the virus during trials had been overblown. The problems in New York have been mirrored across the country. Federal judges in Nebraska, Nevada, Colorado and several other jurisdictions recently suspended jury trials in response to rising virus cases. A court in Austin, Texas, held the state\u2019s first virtual criminal jury trial in August. Each court has determined its own protocols. One local courthouse in Orange County, Calif., has completed 114 criminal trials since May, while the federal courthouse across the street has determined it is unsafe to hold any trials at all. In New York City courts, the challenge of preventing the virus\u2019s spread is magnified by the dense population. In normal times, clerks, court officers and lawyers squeeze into courtroom galleries and line the crowded hallways, waiting for cases to be called. In November alone, at least three dozen people who appeared in eight different criminal courthouses in the city tested positive for the virus, according to the state\u2019s court administrators. Many judges have been eager to begin trials, worried about violating the constitutional rights of people charged with crimes. Without speedy trials, jails become overcrowded, evidence grows stale and witnesses\u2019 memories fade. Early in the pandemic, after New York City officials released hundreds of inmates, the city\u2019s jail population dropped to its lowest level since the 1940s. But the population has increased again \u2014 to 4,669 people last month \u2014 raising fears about the virus spreading among inmates and jail staff. A majority of the inmates are awaiting trial, according to the Center for Court Innovation, a criminal justice nonprofit. But one of the biggest hurdles to restarting trials has been finding defense lawyers who are willing to do them. At a federal hearing in Manhattan, Susan Kellman, a defense lawyer, said she felt unsafe visiting her client in jail, which hindered their ability to prepare for a drug-trafficking trial that had been scheduled for October. Her client has been adamant about going to trial quickly, she said, and regularly screams at her on the telephone. \u201cI\u2019m a single parent. I have two kids. I\u2019m really not ready to die,\u201d she told the judge, who rescheduled the trial. In Brooklyn, Aleksandr Zhukov, a defendant charged in a cybercrime scheme, was finally set to begin trial last month after waiting in jail for two years. But all three of his lawyers asked to quit weeks before the start date, citing fears about the new virus wave. Saritha Komatireddy, a prosecutor on the case, questioned why the lawyers had raised the concern for the first time so close to trial. \u201cThey may be entitled to their own fears, but they\u2019re not entitled to their own facts,\u201d she said at a recent hearing. \u201cTrials are possible.\u201d Out of desperation, Mr. Zhukov asked the judge if he could represent himself, even though Mr. Zhukov, a Russian national, has never studied American law. \u201cFor me, there is no options any more,\u201d Mr. Zhukov said at the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s a must choice right now. It\u2019s the only opportunity to get to trial on time. Otherwise it will be postponed, postponed, postponed, postponed.\u201d The judge assigned Mr. Zhukov a new lawyer and delayed the trial until at least February. Courthouse security officers and defense lawyers have sued to oppose the reopening of New York\u2019s state courts, accusing court administrators of failing to take adequate safety measures. The chief administrative judge has said the courts are thoroughly and regularly cleaned. But a team of physicians hired by the city\u2019s public defender groups contended in an August report that the state\u2019s courthouses were ill-equipped to stop the spread of a virus, pointing to crowded holding cells for defendants, improperly installed plexiglass and poorly ventilated rooms. The virus has infiltrated the city\u2019s courtrooms in ways that threaten both the health of those inside and the constitutional rights of defendants. At a drug trial in state court in Manhattan in October, a police officer testified while wearing a see-through mask and face shield, surrounded by plexiglass. But his testimony was interrupted by drilling noises from the sidewalk, which were audible because the courtroom\u2019s windows had been propped open to improve ventilation. The jurors and the defendant, Demetre Cornish, strained to hear the officer. The judge decided to close a window, but kept the others open, saying, \u201cWe want to keep the air circulating.\u201d Mr. Cornish was acquitted by the jury of some drug and firearm offenses, but convicted of others. His lawyer, Thomas Kenniff, filed a motion on Monday asking the judge to set aside the verdict, arguing that his client did not have a fair and public trial because of restrictions caused by the pandemic. Mr. Cornish\u2019s relatives were denied entry into the courtroom. Their presence would have \u201chad the potential to allow jurors to see him as an individual as opposed to an anonymous masked Black man sitting in the defendant\u2019s chair,\u201d Mr. Kenniff wrote. Face coverings prevented the defense from assessing facial expressions and reactions of potential jurors, Mr. Kenniff said. And the 12-person jury had included only two Black jurors and did not reflect the demographics of the borough, Mr. Kenniff said. Some defense lawyers have raised concerns that the virus\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black and Latino residents might make jury pools less representative. Even before trials were halted entirely, jury selection had been transformed during the pandemic, screening out anyone uncomfortable with health risks. Once seated, juries deliberated in a separate courtroom, giving them more space than they had in cramped jury rooms. Still, some jurors have not seemed keen to stay for too long. A murder trial in the Bronx in July ended in an acquittal on all charges after jurors deliberated for less than an hour. A federal gun possession trial in Brooklyn last month led to a guilty verdict in 30 minutes. Communication between lawyers and their clients, who are supposed to sit six feet apart during trial, has been difficult. Federal courts have provided special phones that operate like walkie-talkies, although lawyers have said that the whispered conversations are picked up by microphones used to address the court. \u201cThe whole technology seems like it was from the days of Alexander Graham Bell,\u201d said Eric Creizman, a lawyer whose client was convicted of securities fraud last month after a federal trial in Manhattan. Even with careful preparations, trials have been derailed by the pandemic. On Long Island, a judge stopped a trial after two days of testimony in September when the defendant revealed that his wife had tested positive for the virus. He said he was unable to isolate from her inside their small house. The trial resumed last month, and a jury convicted him on several drug offenses. One or two other trials that had been halted in March may have also resumed during the pandemic, state court officials said.  \u201cWe are concerned for both victims and defendants that the wheels of justice continue to move,\u201d said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, chief assistant to the Manhattan district attorney. \u201cLanguishing court cases is not good for anybody.\u201d The delays have been frustrating for people like Halley Hopkins, who filed a police report over a year ago accusing her husband of beating and choking her until she was unconscious. Her husband has been out on bail while awaiting trial in Queens. Though a judge has ordered him not to contact her, she remains uneasy. \u201cMy whole life is on hold,\u201d Ms. Hopkins, 41, said.  A lawyer representing Ms. Hopkins\u2019s husband declined to comment. A Brooklyn man charged with burglary said he was kept from entering a drug-treatment program for several months when courts slowed in the spring. Before the pandemic, his case would have been resolved sooner, his lawyers said, but because the state had suspended speedy trial rules for most of the pandemic, there was no urgency. While waiting for trial in jail, he contracted the coronavirus in April. \u201cI wrote a letter to the D.A., begging him to please get me help,\u201d he said in an interview, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear it could affect his case. After a year in jail, he was finally released and entered a treatment program in October. He is still awaiting a resolution in his case. Some trials have stalled because witnesses are unwilling to travel. Stephen M. Calk, founder of Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, has been eager to go to trial since he was charged with bribery last year. Prosecutors have accused him of giving loans to Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, in an effort to obtain an administration job. \u201cI want to do everything I can to clear my name as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Calk told the judge at a hearing in October. But prosecutors said they were struggling to persuade witnesses from Illinois to travel to Manhattan to testify.  Over Mr. Calk\u2019s objections, the judge postponed the trial to February.",

    "article_text": "American Ballet Theater Cancels Season at Metropolitan Opera House American Ballet Theater will not perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in 2021. The company announced the cancellation of its coming season at Lincoln Center on Tuesday, citing the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on its ability to prepare for resuming live performances. A decision has not yet been reached about the company\u2019s shorter fall season at the David H. Koch Theater, another Lincoln Center stage. Many other performing arts groups in New York, including the Metropolitan Opera and New York City Ballet, canceled their spring engagements earlier this fall. The Ballet Theater season was scheduled to begin late in the season, in June, which gave its leaders hope they might be able to persevere with their plans, the company\u2019s executive director, Kara Medoff Barnett, said. But as the pandemic stretched on and virus cases surged this fall, the company determined that staging a full slate of indoor performances in New York City wouldn\u2019t be feasible. Despite the setback, Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater\u2019s artistic director, said he was confident the company would be able to use what it\u2019s learned during the pandemic to find creative ways to make and share dances until it\u2019s possible to perform indoors again. \u201cWe know that we can do this and continue to create, because ultimately that\u2019s our lifeblood,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019d just be, institutionally, trying to keep our pulse alive but we wouldn\u2019t be following our mission.\u201d Last week, as a part of a virtual gala, the company presented new video dances by Pam Tanowitz, Darrell Grand Moultrie, Gemma Bond and Christopher Rudd that were created in cloistered \u201cballet bubbles\u201d in upstate New York and Connecticut. More new work is planned for 2021, with pieces by Alexei Ratmansky, Lauren Lovette and Sonya Tayeh, as well as an expansion by Mr. Moultrie of his recent dance, set to debut either virtually or outdoors. The details are still being finalized, but the company\u2019s aim is to begin performing outside in locations around the United States this spring before returning to New York in the summer to dance for audiences in and around the city. Information about the coming events will be released this winter.",

    "article_text": "U.K. Approves Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine, a First in the West LONDON \u2014 Britain gave emergency authorization on Wednesday to Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine, leaping ahead of the United States to become the first Western country to allow mass inoculations against a disease that has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide. The decision cleared the way for a vaccination campaign with little precedent in modern medicine, encompassing not only ultracold dry ice but also a crusade against anti-vaccine misinformation. Britain\u2019s beating the United States to authorization \u2014 on a vaccine codeveloped by an American company, no less \u2014 intensified pressure on U.S. regulators, who are under fire from the White House for not moving faster to get doses to people. But it also fueled concerns that Britain was acting in haste for political reasons or trying to muscle its way to the front of the line for deliveries. European regulators on Wednesday cast doubt on the rigor of Britain\u2019s review and said that the authorization was limited to specific batches of the vaccine, a claim that Pfizer denied and British officials did not address. Britain\u2019s move provoked a spirited debate among American scientists about whether U.S. regulators, who are known to be unusually meticulous, could afford to hold off any longer on authorizing a vaccine against a virus that is claiming more than 10,000 lives a day worldwide. American regulators have argued that they lag behind \u2014 if only by a matter of days \u2014 because they are virtually alone in reanalyzing thousands of pages of raw data from vaccine trials before approval. Backers of that approach say it is the only way to minimize unintended damage, in lives and in public trust, from vaccines not working. British and European regulators lean more heavily on the companies\u2019 own analyses, auditing their figures occasionally but otherwise grounding their decisions on vaccine makers\u2019 reports. While the more cautious American approach can be valuable, some scientists said the Europeans subject vaccine makers to considerable scrutiny, and it is imperative to move quickly to curb the suffering wrought by the pandemic. \u201cWhen you say it\u2019s OK to wait another week or two, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s OK that many thousands of people are going to die,\u201d said Dr. Walid F. Gellad, who leads the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. No country until Wednesday had authorized a fully tested coronavirus vaccine; Russia and China approved vaccines without waiting for large-scale efficacy tests. The British government, battered by its handling of the pandemic, exulted in the authorization. \u201cHelp is on its way with this vaccine \u2014 and we can now say that with certainty, rather than with all the caveats,\u201d the British health secretary, Matt Hancock, said Wednesday. While the go-ahead bodes well for Britain, which broke from the European Union\u2019s regulatory orbit to approve the vaccine early, it will have no effect on the distribution of the hundreds of millions of doses that the United States and other wealthy countries have procured in prepaid contracts. It also offers little relief to poorer countries that could not afford to buy supplies in advance and may struggle to pay for both the vaccines and the exceptional demands of distributing them.  Roughly 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with BioNTech, a smaller German firm, were being packaged at the company\u2019s Belgian manufacturing plant on Wednesday for shipment to Britain. How and when they will arrive is a secret for security reasons, the company said. The complicated logistics of moving, defrosting and preparing the vaccine meant it was going to be given only at 50 British hospitals to begin with. The vaccine must be transported at South Pole-like temperatures, and in trays of 975 doses. First to be vaccinated will be doctors and nurses in the country\u2019s National Health Service, along with nursing home workers and people 80 and over with previously scheduled doctors\u2019 appointments. A government advisory committee has suggested that older or more vulnerable health workers, and doctors and nurses who work with fragile patients, would be among the first in line. But the government has not said when other employees of the National Health Service would be eligible for vaccines. Essential workers, like teachers, transport workers and first responders, would not be vaccinated until after people 50 and over and those with underlying health problems received shots. The advisory committee plans had made nursing home residents a top priority, but they will have to wait until the government begins distributing vaccines beyond hospitals. Pfizer and BioNTech have suggested that is possible, given that the vaccine can be stored for five days in a normal refrigerator. Eventually, people will get their shots in mass vaccination centers being set up by the military at soccer stadiums and racecourses, or at doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy, and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill,\u201d Prime Mister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd now the scientists have done it.\u201d For Britain, which has suffered one of Europe\u2019s highest per capita death tolls from the virus, the decision by its drug regulator was the latest evidence of a vaccination strategy that has been the most aggressive in the West. Britain remains under the authority of the European Union\u2019s drug regulator until it consummates its split from the bloc on Dec. 31. But the government recently strengthened an old law that allows it to step out from under the bloc\u2019s regulatory umbrella in public health emergencies. That allowed it to fast-track a review of the Pfizer vaccine, which was 95 percent effective in a late-stage clinical trial. Britain had pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine and 315 million doses of competing vaccines, spreading its bets to assure it can inoculate the country\u2019s 67 million people. British ministers cast the speed of the Pfizer approval as an early example of the new flexibility the country will have once it fully untethers itself from European regulation. Yet Brexit has also exacted costs, starving Britain\u2019s drug regulator of money it used to draw from contracts with the European Union.  British regulators are also vetting a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. It is cheaper and easier to store than Pfizer\u2019s, so much of the world could rely on it, but its regulatory path forward in the United States is unclear after scientists and industry analysts questioned promising early results. The chemistry underlying Pfizer\u2019s vaccine had never before produced an approved shot, but scientists have experimented with it for years, testing vaccines that did not make it to market. In order to coax cells to make a viral protein, called a spike, and elicit an immune response, this class of vaccine delivers genetic instructions, known as messenger RNA, encased in tiny fat globules. BioNTech made a prophetic bet on the technology and joined forces with Pfizer, one of the world\u2019s largest drug companies; they ended up delivering stunning results, on a timeline that was unheard-of before this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to decide on emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine shortly after a meeting of an advisory panel on Dec. 10. American officials have said vaccinations could begin within 24 hours after approval. Another American company, Moderna, and the National Institutes of Health have also developed a messenger RNA vaccine that has proved effective in large trials. The F.D.A. will consider their application for emergency authorization shortly after Pfizer\u2019s. The European Medicines Agency, which regulates vaccines across the European Union, is expected to make a decision about the Pfizer vaccine later in December. Pfizer has said it expects to be able to produce up to 50 million doses this year, about half of them going to the United States. Since each person needs two doses, a month apart, up to 25 million people worldwide could begin vaccination before 2021. The United States has bought 100 million doses in advance from Pfizer, and the European Union 200 million doses. The approval arrived at a perilous moment in the pandemic in Britain, where the virus has killed nearly 70,000 people, and hundreds more die each day. A third of England\u2019s hospital systems were caring for more Covid-19 patients in recent weeks than at the height of the first wave in the spring. A monthlong shutdown of restaurants and pubs has stanched the spread of the virus, but that is being replaced by a less stringent system of localized restrictions, with allowances for Christmastime travel that scientists fear will seed another uptick in infections. In a clinical trial, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine proved highly effective among older adults, who are more vulnerable to developing severe Covid-19 and who do not respond strongly to some types of vaccines. It caused no serious side effects.  As vaccines become widely available, the scientific feat of developing them will give way to the social and political problem of convincing people to take them. In Britain, the source of some of the most virulent modern disinformation about vaccines, just over half of people have said in surveys they would definitely accept an inoculation. Safety concerns have been accentuated by the speed of vaccine testing and approval, despite Britain\u2019s regulators saying repeatedly they were not taking shortcuts. Beyond those challenges, manufacturers will quickly need to eventually make billions of doses and move them to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. The Pfizer vaccine makes this effort especially complex. It has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) until shortly before injection, requiring transportation in boxes stuffed with dry ice.

    "article_text": "The Supreme Court Was Right to Block Cuomo\u2019s Religious Restrictions The Supreme Court last week made a major move toward constitutional normalcy: It blocked enforcement of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s hyper-restrictive rules for in-person religious services in New York until the government provides logical justification for treating worship more harshly than seemingly comparable (or riskier) activities. Unfortunately, the substance of the decision has been drowned out by a single-minded focus on judicial politics \u2014 the first evidence that President Trump\u2019s appointments to the court are making a difference. Maybe that is so. In the first two pandemic-related worship-closure cases to get to the court this year, it declined to intervene by 5-to-4 votes, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the Democrat-appointed justices in deferring to state regulators. Last week\u2019s decision went in favor of the Catholic and Orthodox Jewish plaintiffs, with the chief justice in dissent. But politics is a distorted lens for understanding the case. Looking to the substance, six justices agreed that the Free Exercise Clause was probably violated by the governor\u2019s order. The restrictions, which are far more draconian than those approved by the court in the earlier cases, are both extraordinarily tight and essentially unexplained. In red zones, where infection rates are the highest, worship is limited to 10 persons, no matter how large the facility \u2014 whether St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral (seating capacity: 2,500) or a tiny shul in Brooklyn. Because Orthodox Jewish services require a quorum (\u201cminyan\u201d) of 10 adult men, this is an effective prohibition on the ability of Orthodox women to attend services. Orange zones are only slightly less restrictive; 25 congregants may attend. In both red and orange zones, \u201cessential\u201d businesses \u2014 a broad category that includes everything from big-box retailers to pet shops to lawyers\u2019 offices \u2014 may remain open without capacity limitations. One reads the parties\u2019 briefs in vain for a cogent explanation of the difference in treatment. The briefs note that worship services in excess of 500 have spread the coronavirus and that some experts think numerical caps are more efficacious than percentages. But they give no systematic explanation of why the governor crafted the restrictions as he did. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was convinced that churches are not comparable with retail outlets, reasoning that \u201cbike repair shops and liquor stores generally do not feature customers gathering inside to sing and speak together for an hour or more at a time.\u201d But, putting aside the fact that liquor stores and bike shops are not necessarily typical \u2014 think the Home Depot on a Saturday \u2014 customers are not the only members of the public who matter. The workers at stores and factories are exposed to every single customer and co-worker who enters, and they remain for an entire workday in the same indoor space, often not effectively socially distanced. They may not sing, but they have been known to laugh, shout or yell. In the beginning of the pandemic, no one knew what worked and what didn\u2019t. Courts were understandably reluctant to second-guess. But we are now 10 months into the pandemic. Why are governments still picking and choosing among constitutional rights without explaining their reasoning? The five justices in the majority were not the only ones skeptical of Governor Cuomo\u2019s orders. Neither the chief justice nor Justice Stephen Breyer signed on to Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent, the only opinion that squarely upheld the restrictions on their merits. Indeed, Chief Justice Roberts noted, \u201cit may well be that such restrictions violate the Free Exercise Clause,\u201d and Justice Breyer, stressing how remarkably low the permitted numbers were, wrote that \u201cthe State of New York will, and should, seek ways of appropriately recognizing the religious interests here at issue without risking harm to the health and safety of the people of New York\u201d \u2014 signaling that he agrees that some accommodation ought to be made. Likewise, the justices in the majority seemed to have little sympathy for a general rebellion against all Covid-19 mandates. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, specifically noted that he did not \u201cdoubt the state\u2019s authority to impose tailored restrictions \u2014 even very strict restrictions \u2014 on attendance at religious services and secular gatherings alike.\u201d During a public health emergency, individual freedoms can be curtailed where necessary to protect against the spread of disease. Most of this authority is at the state and local, not the federal, level. But when public health measures intrude on civil liberties \u2014 not just religious exercise, but other constitutional rights \u2014 judges will insist that the measures be nonarbitrary, nondiscriminatory and no more restrictive than the facts and evidence demand. The real disagreement between Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Breyer and the majority was over a technical though important detail. This disagreement made the court look more fractured than it actually was. Just days before the decision, on Nov. 19, the governor\u2019s lawyers sent the court a letter stating that he had redrawn the red and orange zones in Brooklyn, conveniently putting the churches and synagogues that were the focus of the litigation into the more permissive yellow zone. The letter cited no reasons for the reclassification and offered no assurance that it might not happen again, at a moment\u2019s notice, with no more explanation than this time. The court majority regarded the governor\u2019s about-face as too fleeting and changeable to derail a decision on the merits. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Breyer, by contrast, concluded that the change eliminated any need for the court to intervene, at least for now. That is a reasonable position (though we disagree with it) \u2014 and it does not indicate any fundamental disagreement with the five justices in the majority about the need to protect civil liberties even in a time of emergency. Perhaps Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Breyer believed that Governor Cuomo and government officials around the country will read the court\u2019s opinions and recognize that it is time to bury the meat cleaver and begin to regulate constitutional freedoms with a scalpel \u2014 without the need for a judicial order. That message is lost if the case is seen as the mere product of Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s arrival at the Supreme Court. With the presidential election behind us, the balance between Covid-19 precautions and civil liberties no longer needs to be a partisan issue. The right to exercise religion in accordance with conscience is one of the most important in the Bill of Rights, and it is time for mayors and governors \u2014 and courts \u2014 to treat it that way.

    "article_text": "Biden and His Economic Team Urge Quick Action on Stimulus as Risks Mount WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday introduced the economic team he will rely on to help rebuild the U.S. economy at a perilous moment, with coronavirus cases soaring, the Federal Reserve chair warning of challenging months ahead and lawmakers in Congress still struggling to reach agreement on a rescue package. Mr. Biden, speaking in Delaware, called on Congress to pass a substantial relief package to help keep businesses, households and local governments afloat while his Treasury secretary nominee, Janet L. Yellen, called the damage done so far \u201can American tragedy\u201d that could lead to long-term devastation if not quickly corrected. \u201cRight now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. But he acknowledged that any stimulus agreement would necessarily fall far short of the trillions of dollars that Democratic leaders have insisted on for months, saying that \u201cany package passed in a lame-duck session is lucky to be at best just a start.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s nominees made it clear that they were thinking expansively about how to revive the U.S. economy and looking beyond just restoring lost jobs and livelihoods to finding ways to widen economic wealth, broaden opportunities and repair safety net programs. \u201cThis is a moment of urgency and opportunity unlike anything we\u2019ve faced in modern times,\u201d said Cecilia Rouse, Mr. Biden\u2019s nominee to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThe urgency of ending a devastating crisis. And the opportunity to build a better economy in its wake \u2014 an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.\u201d But those goals, which were at the center of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, are likely to run into obstacles in Congress, where Republicans, who spent the past four years on a spending spree, have resurrected their concerns about the federal deficit. They have cited it as a reason to forgo the kind of large stimulus package that Mr. Biden and other top Democrats have said is needed. The political divisions were on display Tuesday, as a bipartisan group of centrist senators announced in the morning that they were working on a $908 billion compromise stimulus package. By the afternoon, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced that he had been discussing his own proposal with Trump administration officials and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader. That package would be hundreds of billions of dollars smaller than the bipartisan plan \u2014 and thus a nonstarter with Democrats. But Mr. McConnell seemed to suggest that President Trump would not sign a more expansive bill, reminding Republicans in a private conference call and reporters during a news conference that a presidential signature is needed. The continued likelihood of congressional gridlock before Inauguration Day threatens to saddle Mr. Biden\u2019s economic team with dim prospects come Jan. 21, when it will confront an economy that has seen a slowdown in hiring growth, manufacturing activity and other key measures in recent weeks. Millions of Americans are set to lose unemployment assistance at year\u2019s end. Others could face eviction and foreclosure as government moratoriums expire. \u201cThe pace of improvement has moderated,\u201d the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, saying the rise in virus cases was \u201cconcerning and could prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d \u201cThe risk of overdoing it is less than the risk of underdoing it,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Administration officials have shown little sign of worry about recent economic developments, insisting the recovery is on track while Mr. Trump continues his legal quest to overturn his re-election defeat at the polls. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing alongside Mr. Powell, downplayed the broader risks facing the economy and blamed economic shutdowns in some states for slowing progress. While he called for targeted relief for sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, like restaurants and airlines, he said the economy had recovered faster than many had expected and that the economy had \u201cregained 58 percent of the lost jobs.\u201d He defended his decision to end several of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs on Dec. 31. He has also requested that the central bank return the Treasury funds supporting those programs. Democrats said the moves amounted to economic sabotage. \u201cEither you\u2019re purposefully trying to stop President-elect Biden and Janet Yellen from getting to work for the people we all serve, or you\u2019re so delusional that you think because the stock market is back up, everything is fine,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s malpractice.\u201d Mr. Powell, who told lawmakers that the Fed would have preferred to keep those lending programs going while acknowledging that it was Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s place to decide, painted a more dire picture of the economic outlook. He pointed to continued uncertainty around the speed of a vaccine rollout, the reality that millions remain out of work and the fact that small businesses could fail in the winter months. \u201cWe do have a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use our tools until the danger is well and truly past, and it may require help from other parts of government as well, including Congress.\u201d Republicans insist that the economy is recovering and that the United States does not need to borrow more money for another big relief package, while Democrats insist that a large jolt of stimulus is necessary and that now is not the time to worry about deficits. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason states and localities have to have a balanced budget but we\u2019re allowed to have a deficit to deal with crises and emergencies as we have in the past,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe have to keep vital public services running, have to give aid to local and state governments to make sure they can have law enforcement officers, firefighters and educators as we did in 2009.\u201d After months of deadlock on Capitol Hill, a bipartisan group of senators tried to move things forward with the $908 billion compromise stimulus proposal, funded in part by repurposing the money that Mr. Mnuchin clawed back from the Fed lending programs. The proposal, spearheaded by two centrists \u2014 Senators Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine \u2014 and a handful of senators from both parties, has not been publicly endorsed by either Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California or Mr. McConnell. Intended as a stopgap measure to last until March, it would restore federal unemployment benefits that lapsed over the summer, but at half the rate, providing $300 a week for 18 weeks, and does not include another round of checks for every American. The measure would provide $160 billion to help state, local and tribal governments facing fiscal ruin \u2014 a fraction of what Democrats had sought. Also included was $288 billion to help small businesses, restaurants and theaters, and a short-term federal liability shield from coronavirus-related lawsuits. In contrast, the framework circulated on Capitol Hill by top Republicans does not include funds for state and local governments and curtails a short restoration of federal unemployment benefits even further. \u201cThe advantage of our compromise bill is it has bipartisan, bicameral support,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI want a bill that can become law.\u201d The bipartisan plan is an attempt to find a middle ground between the dueling stimulus proposals that Democrats and Republicans have haggled over for months. Its cost is less than half of what Democratic leaders had pushed for in the weeks leading up to the election but nearly double the latest proposal from Republican leaders. It includes most of the main ingredients that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders have called critical for a deal, a possible sign that it could form a basis for a compromise that Mr. Biden could get behind. Asked about the plan by reporters after his event with his economic team, Mr. Biden replied: \u201cI just heard about it. I\u2019ll take a look at it when I get back.\u201d The fresh attempt at a bipartisan compromise came as Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin held their first phone discussion since late October, when they had a flurry of pre-election conversations that failed to culminate in a deal. Ms. Pelosi said she and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had sent a new proposal of their own to Republican leaders on Monday. John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group think tank in Washington, which has pushed for more small-business aid, said the bipartisan plan \u201cseems close to being the sweet spot\u201d for a possible compromise \u2014 if one is possible. Some Senate Republicans on Tuesday reiterated opposition to any deal that sends money to support state and local government budgets, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana challenging Mr. Powell at the hearing about whether states are really in such bad straits and suggesting the money would be used to shore up shaky pension funds. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, I think it\u2019s an area that\u2019s worth looking,\u201d Mr. Powell said, noting that states are among the largest employers in the economy and that they provide critical services. Mr. Biden\u2019s appointees all sounded an urgent tone as the incoming administration faces the prospect of a double-dip recession. His nominees, all of whom must win Senate confirmation, talked about the pain of the pandemic recession, noting that it was falling hardest on traditionally marginalized Americans and widening the divide between the rich and the poor. Ms. Yellen, a former Fed chair and an academic labor economist, said she had gone into economics \u201cbecause I was concerned about the toll of unemployment on people, families and communities.\u201d She warned that inaction in the face of the current economic crisis \u201cwill produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.\u201d Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Surging Virus Exposes California\u2019s Weak Spot: A Lack of Hospital Beds and Staff SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For all its size and economic might, California has long had few hospital beds relative to its population, a shortfall that state officials now say may prove catastrophic. California is experiencing its largest surge in coronavirus cases with an average of nearly 15,000 new cases a day, an increase of 50 percent from the previous record over the summer. So even though the state has some of the country\u2019s most restrictive measures to prevent the spread of the virus, an influx of people with severe cases of Covid-19 may force overwhelmed hospitals to turn patients away by Christmas, Gov. Gavin Newsom warned this week. [Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.] A dearth of hospital beds has been a worldwide problem throughout the pandemic, but California, with a population of 40 million, has a particularly acute shortage. The wealthiest state in the wealthiest country has 1.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, a level that exceeds only two states, Washington and Oregon, according to 2018 data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. California has one-third the number of beds per capita as Poland. Many hospitals in California have maintained lower numbers of beds in part to limit the length of patient stays and lower costs. But that approach is now being tested. In addition to beds, a shortage of nursing staff will make handling the surge of virus cases \u201cextraordinarily difficult for us in California,\u201d said Carmela Coyle, the head of the California Hospital Association, which represents 400 hospitals across the state. \u201cThis pandemic is a story of shortage, whether it is shortages of personal protective equipment, shortages of testing supplies, shortages of the trained staff needed to deal with these patients,\u201d Ms. Coyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s what has made this pandemic unique and different from other disasters.\u201d Also unlike other catastrophes, California will not be able to rely on other states for assistance. Mutual aid has been a cornerstone in its planning for disasters, requesting, for example, thousands of firefighters from neighboring states to help in dousing the mega-fires of recent years. But with so many parts of the country struggling with the coronavirus at the same time, there are few traveling nurses available or nearby hospital beds to spare. \u201cYou have to think of this as a natural disaster, like an earthquake \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of need for hospitalization,\u201d said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cBut the difference here is that it\u2019s happening across the country. We can\u2019t send people to Reno, Phoenix or Tucson. We\u2019re stuck.\u201d The state government says it has 11 surge facilities, or alternative setups, including mothballed medical buildings and at least one sports arena, ready if hospitals become overloaded. Beyond California, hospitals have been scrambling in recent weeks to handle a new rush of patients, particularly in parts of the Sun Belt and New England that had largely avoided coronavirus spikes in the spring and summer. The country is likely to hit a record 100,000 hospitalizations this week. As hospitals exceed or get close to exceeding their capacity for coronavirus patients, state and local officials have been opening hospitals in parking lots or unoccupied buildings. In Rhode Island, where infections have rapidly increased in recent weeks, a field hospital opened on Monday in the state\u2019s second-largest city, Cranston. At a cost of $8 million, a former call center for Citizens Bank was converted into a 335-bed field hospital. In New Mexico, a vacant medical center in Albuquerque was being used for recovering coronavirus patients. \u201cWe are seeing the worst rates that we\u2019ve seen since the pandemic hit,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said in a recent interview. Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association\u2019s vice president for quality and patient safety policy, said hospital systems that are busy during the pandemic have not yet fully examined how they could have been better prepared. But she said the lack of hospital beds in many states reflected pre-Covid times. \u201cIn an era when you\u2019re focused on reducing the cost of health care, having excess capacity \u2014 that you\u2019re heating and lighting and cleaning and all of that stuff \u2014 is just antithetical to your efforts to be as lean as possible, to be as cost-efficient as possible,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have some critical thinking around what\u2019s that right balance between keeping costs low and being prepared in case a disaster happens.\u201d The number of hospital beds in California has declined over time partly because of a trend toward more outpatient care, said Kristof Stremikis, an expert on the state\u2019s hospital system at the California Health Care Foundation. But more acute than the shortage of beds, Mr. Stremikis says, are staffing shortages, especially in regions with high concentrations of Black, Latino and Native American patients. \u201cThe system is blinking red when it comes to the work force,\u201d Mr. Stremikis said. \u201cIt\u2019s nurses, doctors, allied health professionals \u2014 we don\u2019t have enough of many different types of clinicians in California and they\u2019re not in the right places. It\u2019s a huge issue.\u201d Mr. Newsom has said California would draw from a registry of retired or nonpracticing health care workers and deploy them to hospitals. But Ms. Coyle, the head of the California Hospital Association, says she does not think volunteers can bridge the gap. \u201cWe are down to a very, very small fraction who are willing to serve,\u201d she said. \u201cThose volunteers were not trained at a level to be as helpful in a hospital setting.\u201d At the county level, health officers are counting down the days until their hospitals are full. On Sunday, California became the first state to record more than 100,000 cases in a week, according to a New York Times database. The state government estimates that about 12 percent of cases end up in a hospital. Dr. Sara Cody, the chief health officer for Santa Clara County, which includes a large slice of Silicon Valley, projects that hospitals in the county will reach capacity by mid-December. \u201cThis is the most difficult phase of the pandemic so far,\u201d Dr. Cody said. \u201cEveryone is tired.\u201d She is expecting a spike in cases from Thanksgiving gatherings, which could accelerate the timeline, she said. Few states have been as aggressive in combating the pandemic as California, which now has a stockpile of a half-billion face masks. Los Angeles last week announced a ban on gatherings with other households. In Santa Clara County, hotels are now only reserved for essential travel and a ban on contact sports is forcing the San Francisco 49ers to play home games in Arizona. \u201cWe have done everything that we can do as local leaders and health officials,\u201d said Dr. Cody, who led the effort in March to put in place the country\u2019s first shelter-in-place order. \u201cWe have worked as hard as we can work. We have tried everything that we know how to do. But without bold action at the state or federal level we are not going to be able to slow this down. We are not an island.\u201d Across California a weary populace wondered about the effectiveness of the state\u2019s measures. In Los Angeles, local officials were under fire after hundreds of tests scheduled for Tuesday at Union Station were canceled because of a film shoot, a remake of the 1990s romantic comedy \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d People who had scheduled tests were informed of the cancellation on Monday afternoon, and it was not until after midnight that Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the tests were back on. The filming was still taking place on Tuesday morning as Wendy Ambriz swabbed her mouth at the station\u2019s testing kiosk. Ms. Ambriz did not think the county\u2019s restriction of outdoor dining, which went into effect last week, was necessary, noting that kitchen staffs are fastidious about cleanliness. But she did not blame government officials for the coronavirus spiraling out of control in Southern California. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really follow directions,\u201d she said. That assessment appears to hold true for some of the state\u2019s officials. Sheila Kuehl, who sits on the county board of supervisors, was spotted at an Italian restaurant in Santa Monica hours after publicly calling outdoor dining \u201ca most dangerous situation\u201d and voting to ban it. In a statement on Monday, Ms. Kuehl\u2019s office noted that the ban had not yet gone into effect when the dinner occurred. Her meal recalled another moment of apparent hypocrisy, a meal attended by Mr. Newsom and a gaggle of lobbyists at the luxurious French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley just as the governor was advising residents to avoid meeting with large groups. Outside the Broad Street Oyster Company in Malibu last week, picnic tables were cordoned off and the restaurant was not seating customers. But that did not stop people from eating there \u2014 they just ducked under the tape. Thomas Fuller reported from San Francisco, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.

    "article_text": "Rapid Testing for Children Barrels Ahead, Despite a Lack of Data As Covid-19 tears across the country, health experts have been calling for increased access to testing that will help track and contain the virus\u2019s swift and often silent spread. But some of the cheapest and most convenient diagnostic tools on the market might not perform as promised in a crucial contingent of the population, in which they were already being used: children, whose pint-size bodies might make the coronavirus more difficult to detect. A small but growing body of evidence, some of which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, suggests that some rapid tests for the coronavirus may falter in very young people, letting low-level infections slip by unnoticed. In a recent study of more than 1,600 people in Massachusetts, Binax NOW, a rapid test manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, caught 96.5 percent of the coronavirus infections found by a more accurate laboratory test in adults with symptoms. But the rapid test detected just 77.8 percent of the symptomatic cases in people 18 or under. Among people without symptoms, the test faltered further, identifying 70.2 percent of adults and 63.6 percent of children. Another recent paper, published in November in Clinical Microbiology and Infection, found that a different rapid test by Abbott, called the PanBio, identified just 62.5 percent of coronavirus cases in people 16 or younger, compared with 82.6 percent of infections in adults, although the number of pediatric samples tested was small. Children rarely seem to have serious cases of Covid, and the youngest among them may also be less likely to pass the coronavirus on to others. But the new findings should encourage more in-depth studies of diagnostic tools for the virus in pediatric populations, health experts said. \u201cAt this moment, I think it\u2019s still totally possible that these tests perform the same way\u201d in children as they do in adults, said Dr. Nira Pollock, the associate medical director of the infectious diseases diagnostic laboratory at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and one of the researchers who led the Massachusetts study. But without solid data demonstrating how coronavirus diagnostics perform in children, she added, it would be a mistake to assume that young people will test as easily as adults. Nonetheless, the tests\u2019 performance seems to have been taken for granted. The Binax NOW, which received an emergency green light from the Food and Drug Administration in August, was not tested in anyone younger than 22 before Abbott sought the federal agency\u2019s authorization. Yet the government has already purchased millions of these tests and begun to distribute them to governors and vulnerable communities, encouraging their use in schools as screening tools. Another of Abbott\u2019s rapid tests, ID NOW, also excluded people 21 and younger from early studies, but it has already appeared in clinics across the country. And a widely used rapid test called the Veritor, made by Becton, Dickinson and Company, was not evaluated in people younger than 18, but it had been publicly optioned for use in schools. Several other rapid testing companies, including Access Bio and LumiraDx, did include a small number of minors in their preliminary studies, but they declined to provide data on performance across age. In medicine, children are often \u201cassumed to be just miniature versions of grown-ups,\u201d said Jennifer Dien Bard, director of the clinical microbiology and virology laboratory at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. \u201cBut they are not just small adults. It\u2019s really important that any testing that is available, that there are specific strategies offered for children and their specific needs.\u201d In the rush to clear treatments, vaccines and diagnostics for widespread use, companies often neglect to include children in early trials that test whether products or therapies are safe and effective. But tests for viruses, bacteria and other infectious microbes that yield stellar results for adults do not always translate perfectly for children. The reasons behind these differences are not always obvious, Dr. Pollock said. For instance, children\u2019s immune systems might be better at homing in on and sequestering certain infectious invaders, making them harder to detect with standard-issue tests. In one study, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology in October, Dr. Pollock and her team amassed data from nine pediatric hospitals across the country, all of which reported relatively scant counts of the virus in children without symptoms. Another, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, hinted at a similar trend in children who were sick. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Laboratory tests, such as those that use a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., are sensitive enough to uncover these low-level infections, Dr. Pollock said. But the virus may not be present in high enough amounts to be discovered by a rapid test, such as those that detect only relatively large quantities of antigens, or bits of coronavirus proteins. The Binax NOW is one such test. Many such children \u201care going to be negative on rapid tests,\u201d Dr. Pollock said. \u201cThat impacts how we think about school settings and day care.\u201d It may be that some children are naturally predisposed to harbor less of the virus. It was also possible that the children in these studies were all sampled too late in their infections, when the virus had already petered out. If that was the case, Dr. Pollock said, these children might have once carried or even transmitted the virus in large amounts, but they were not tested during that time. Teasing apart these scenarios may be difficult without testing many more children, she said. For now, \u201cif your goal is to detect infection, molecular tests are the way to go,\u201d she said, referring to laboratory diagnostics like those that use P.C.R. Still, if children truly do carry around less of the virus, it may be acceptable that some cases are missed by certain tests, said Dr. Ibukun Akinboyo, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at Duke University in Durham, N.C. \u201cIt depends on the goal of testing,\u201d Dr. Akinboyo said. People who carry less of the virus may be less likely to transmit it to others, for instance. In response to the recent findings out of Massachusetts, Kimberly Modory, a spokeswoman for Abbott, noted that Binax NOW \u201cis for use within seven days of symptom onset\u201d and that the test performed \u201cwell\u201d in this window of time. She pointed out that if symptomatic children who were carrying low amounts of the virus \u2014 a group the company argued were less likely to be infectious \u2014 were discarded from the data set, the test\u2019s performance increased. Abbott declined to comment on the findings among asymptomatic people, noting the company was conducting its own studies on the matter. But several experts caution that tests alone cannot determine whether someone is contagious, or rule out the risk of passing a pathogen to others. Harboring less of the virus in your nose does not necessarily mean you pose less of a transmission risk, especially in an understudied population like children, Dr. Dien Bard, of Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, said. \u201cThese people can very well still be infectious.\u201d [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

    "article_text": "Reinventing Workers for the Post-Covid Economy Rob Siminoski has been in the theater, in one way or another, since he graduated from college. But after 10 years at the Universal Studios theme park in California, he is only No. 13 on the stage-managing roster. Even if the park, closed since March, reopens some attractions \u2014 the WaterWorld stunt show, say, or the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle \u2014 he is unlikely to be among the first to get the call. His luck is that his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, offers an apprenticeship program for on-set movie electricians. It takes five years, and Mr. Siminoski, 33, is going to have to brush up his high school algebra to get in. Still, it offers a good balance of risk and reward. \u201cEveryone needs electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou pull down six figures.\u201d The nation\u2019s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will hinge to some extent on how quickly show managers can become electricians, whether taxi drivers can become plumbers, and how many cooks can manage software for a bank. The labor market has recovered 12 million of the 22 million jobs lost from February to April. But many positions may not return any time soon, even when a vaccine is deployed. This is likely to prove especially problematic for millions of low-paid workers in service industries like retailing, hospitality, building maintenance and transportation, which may be permanently impaired or fundamentally transformed. What will janitors do if fewer people work in offices? What will waiters do if the urban restaurant ecosystem never recovers its density? Their prognosis is bleak. Marcela Escobari, an economist at the Brookings Institution, warns that even if the economy adds jobs as the coronavirus risk fades, \u201cthe rebound won\u2019t help the people that have been hurt the most.\u201d Looking back over 16 years of data, Ms. Escobari finds that workers in the occupations most heavily hit since the spring will have a difficult time reinventing themselves. Taxi drivers, dancers and front-desk clerks have poor track records moving to jobs as, say, registered nurses, pipe layers or instrumentation technicians. \u201cMany of today\u2019s unemployed workers may find it harder than in the past to find new jobs and advance through the labor market,\u201d Ms. Escobari wrote.

Source: Brookings Institution Covid is abruptly taking out a swath of jobs that were thought to be comparatively resilient, in services that require personal contact with customers. And the jolt has landed squarely on workers with little or no education beyond high school, toiling in the low-wage service economy. \u201cThe damage to the economy and particularly to workers will probably be longer lasting than we think it is going to be,\u201d said Peter Beard, senior vice president for regional work force development at the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development group. What\u2019s more, he said, Covid will intensify underlying dynamics that were already transforming the workplace. Automation, for one, will most likely accelerate as employers seek to protect their businesses from future pandemics. The challenge is not insurmountable. Stephanie Brown, who spent 11 years in the Air Force, found her footing relatively quickly after losing her job as a cook at a hotel in Rochester, Mich., in March. She took advantage of a training program offered by Salesforce, the big software platform for businesses, and got a full-time job in October as a Salesforce administrator for the New York software company Pymetrics from her home in Ann Arbor, Mich.  Yet despite scattered success stories, moving millions of workers into new occupations remains an enormous challenge. Jared Sooper is also looking for a change after losing his job last March managing a restaurant in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. Fleeing San Diego\u2019s rents, he and his fianc\u00e9e packed their things in a U-Haul trailer and relocated to a converted storage space under the deck of her parents\u2019 house near Providence, R.I. Once there, Mr. Sooper, 37, learned of an initiative financed by the state government to train workers displaced by the pandemic and connect them to job opportunities. In November, he finished a five-week program run by Local 51 of the union for the plumbing and pipe fitting trades to become a welder. \u201c2020 seems to be turning around,\u201d Mr. Sooper said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty confident. If they don\u2019t take me for this one, there are others I can apply to.\u201d Still, he couldn\u2019t immediately find a union job as a welder, so for the time being he took a job doing body work for a company that makes eco-friendly bus frames. Derrius Gosha, 30, had been in Los Angeles for only a few months when the pandemic ended his job on the sales floor of Bath and Body Works in February. He is now back at home in Birmingham, Ala., living with his mother and grandmother. John Restrepo, 25, furloughed in March from his job as a server at Tony\u2019s Town Square Restaurant in Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla., is sticking it out in an apartment with his two roommates. Barbara Xocoyotl, 57, furloughed in March from her cleaning job at the Omni hotel in New Haven, Conn., had to give up her apartment and is living with a daughter in New York. All are waiting for the economy to restore the jobs they have known. \u201cIf there are no retail jobs, I could work at a warehouse, and I\u2019m OK on a conveyor belt,\u201d Mr. Gosha said. \u201cThe only thing I wouldn\u2019t want to do is put on a hard hat and go dig a ditch.\u201d After weeks of hunting, he landed a seasonal position in the lawn and garden section at Lowe\u2019s. Often, the old jobs just don\u2019t return at all. As he searches for an opening at CVS, or Walgreens, or another restaurant in town, Mr. Restrepo pins his hope on a deal that his UNITE HERE union local struck with Disney to offer the workers it let go a first crack at jobs once business returns, and retrain them for other Disney jobs if their old positions are terminated. \u201cThinking optimistically, by the summer of 2022, the majority of us will be able to go back,\u201d he said. Ms. Xocoyotl has a doomsday plan in case the old jobs don\u2019t return: to return to her hometown in central Mexico to be close to her mother. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a job, but nobody calls me back, nobody tells me anything,\u201d she said. At her age, she added, \u201cpeople don\u2019t even ask what one is good for anymore.\u201d Training has always been a challenge for policymakers, and the pandemic complicates matching new skills with jobs. Austin Urick, 31, went back to school after he lost his job last year selling equipment for the oil and gas industry. He enrolled at San Jacinto College near Houston to learn instrumentation and electrical systems. He expects to graduate this month, certified to calibrate and replace gauges and pumps used by oil and gas companies. The industry, however, has suffered during the pandemic. While he has some good leads, his job hunt hasn\u2019t yielded any offers. \u201cIt is worrisome,\u201d Mr. Urick said. \u201cBut my Plan B is not just oil and gas.\u201d The instrumentation degree can be taken in different directions. \u201cI can work in an elevator company or in a hospital, anywhere that has gauges,\u201d he added. \u201cI can go down the street to Budweiser.\u201d Harris County, where much of Houston sits, lost about 160,000 jobs in the year through September. Using emergency money approved by Congress in the CARES Act, it has enlisted community colleges and nonprofit groups to develop training programs to move 3,000 workers whose jobs were hit by the pandemic into more resilient occupations: plumbing or accounting, nursing or coding. \u201cWork force development was a major priority when I came into the office,\u201d said Adrian Garcia, a county commissioner whose district is among the poorest there. \u201cNow, with the pandemic in our midst, it is critical.\u201d With the training program filling up, he is counting on the county to find money to expand it. And yet at scale, it will be a considerable challenge to assist workers in the transition to a new economy in which many jobs are gone for good and those available often require proficiency in sophisticated digital tools. \u201cWe need a New Deal for skills,\u201d said Amit Sevak, president of Revature, a company that hires workers, trains them to use digital tools and helps place them in jobs. \u201cPresident Roosevelt deployed the massive number of workers unemployed in the Great Depression on projects that created many of the dams and roads and bridges we have. We need something like that.\u201d Rhode Island is using stimulus money from the CARES Act to fund a training initiative that provides additional support for workers \u2014 like child care and transportation assistance \u2014 and gets commitments from employers to hire trainees. Gov. Gina Raimondo thinks the pandemic offers an opportunity for something similar on a national level. But she acknowledges that this is a heavy lift. \u201cThis stuff is easy to say and really hard to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about transitioning a whole economy, and transitions are hard.\u201d Mr. Siminoski, for one, is hoping that his transition from theme park stage manager to movie electrician pays off. But while he\u2019s waiting, he still has to put food on the table. So for the immediate future he\u2019s thinking about going to driving school to get a truck driver\u2019s license. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive \u2014 about $1,600,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think training takes less than a month, and it seems you can get a job right away.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Why the Pandemic Has Made Streets More Dangerous for Blind People For pedestrians who cannot see or have limited vision, navigating the chaotic sidewalks and crosswalks of New York City was dicey enough before the pandemic. But the outbreak, blind people say, has made crossing the city\u2019s streets even riskier and more harrowing. It has reduced the flow of cars and trucks at times, leaving streets in some neighborhoods as placid as suburban lanes. That may sound like a blessing for blind New Yorkers like Terence Page. But, in fact, the opposite is true. The normal roar of traffic moving past provides clues \u2014 often the only ones \u2014 about when it is time to venture into a crosswalk. \u201cQuiet is not good for blind people,\u201d Mr. Page said as he swept his long green cane across the sidewalk along Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, trying to locate the curb at West 23rd Street. But Mr. Page had just traversed the avenue with confidence because that crossing is equipped with an audible signal that tells pedestrians when they have the go-ahead to stride across the pavement. The vast majority of the city\u2019s 13,200 crossings are not, including the one at 23rd Street that Mr. Page faced after crossing Sixth Avenue. As a result, a federal judge has found that the city has failed to fully protect some of its most vulnerable residents. The judge ruled in October that the \u201cnear-total absence\u201d of those devices \u2014 known as Accessible Pedestrian Signals \u2014 violated the civil rights of blind people by denying them equal access to the city\u2019s crosswalks. Blind New Yorkers \u201cmust risk being hit by cars and bicycles and becoming stranded in the middle of intersections,\u201d wrote the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Page, six feet and sturdy, knows well what the judge was describing. Standing at the northeast corner of the normally busy intersection, Mr. Page hesitated. Without an audible device, blind pedestrians like him have to guess when they have the light. \u201cI know I am taking my life in my hands,\u201d Mr. Page said, as he prepared to step off the curb half a block from his home. The court ordered the city to negotiate with the group that filed the suit, the American Council of the Blind of New York, on a remedy for the lack of audible signals. That decision was welcomed by Mr. Page and advocates for the blind who have been pressing city officials for years to address the issue. \u201cWe are thrilled with the dramatic changes that this victory will mean not only for those who are blind or low vision, but for all New Yorkers who want safer streets,\u201d said Torie Atkinson, a staff attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, which represented the plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed in 2018. City officials declined to explain why audible signals have been installed at less than 5 percent of the city\u2019s intersections that have traffic signals. Instead, Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, issued a statement saying, \u201cThe city is dedicated to making our streets more accessible to all New Yorkers with and without disabilities, including those are who are blind or have low vision.\u201d He added that the Department of Transportation plans to continue to install audible signals across the city. Since 2014, the city has had a Vision Zero policy to reduce pedestrian fatalities, which has included redesigns of intersections and signals. But advocates argue that some of those changes have actually made matters worse for the blind. At some intersections, the Department of Transportation has implemented \u201cleading pedestrian intervals,\u201d which give walkers a head start of several seconds before the light turns green for the parallel traffic. But Lori Scharff, former president of the American Council of the Blind of New York, said that does not help them because they rely on traffic noise for cues. Without the roar of engines in motion, they are left standing at the curb while sighted people rush across the street, Ms. Scharff said. When in doubt, they often can rely on other pedestrians to offer guidance or an elbow to clasp. But in the grip of Covid-19, fellow travelers are less inclined to get so close, Mr. Page said. \u201cThere are less people who want to help you or even touch you,\u201d he explained. \u201cSince Covid has happened, a lot of the things that blind people need are not there.\u201d To make matters more challenging, the sidewalks and streets are filled with new obstacles: dining tables surrounded by makeshift fences and tents. As Mr. Page ambled up Seventh Avenue, his face smacked into an umbrella emblazoned with a Campari logo that protruded into his path.  The midday journey around Mr. Page\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood revealed just how hazardous things would be for blind pedestrians in New York even if intersections were equipped with audible signals. But there are fewer than 700 of those beeping devices across the city. \u201cWhen I hear an A.P.S., I feel safe,\u201d Mr. Page said.  In a four-block loop from his building on the north side of 23rd Street, Mr. Page encountered a variety of hazards, including scaffolding, police barricades, sandwich boards promoting businesses, workmen sprawled on the sidewalk eating lunch and open stairways to the subway. He took all those in stride, locating them with his ball-tipped cane \u2014 \u201cJets green\u201d for his favorite football team \u2014 before they caused him any harm. But the stop-and-go traffic of cars, trucks, buses and bicycles was a different matter. When he returned to Sixth Avenue and crossed at 22nd Street without the aid of an audible signal, Mr. Page paused to catch his breath and admitted how anxious that made him. He said he usually depended on strangers for guidance, though he would rather not. He said people frequently take hold of his arm, meaning to be helpful. But he has to explain that he would rather take hold of theirs so that they can guide him. Right on cue, a young woman gripped Mr. Page\u2019s elbow and offered to help him across 23rd Street at Seventh Avenue. He switched to holding her arm and chatted with her as they crossed, even though he had the aid of an audible signal there. The woman, Yolanda Yona, an interior designer and model from Zimbabwe, said she had noticed the beeping that emanated from yellow devices on each corner. \u201cI just like helping people I guess,\u201d she said, adding that she was undeterred by the pandemic. Even a few audible signals would be a godsend for Myrna Votta, who has had to negotiate the streets of Brooklyn Heights without them for more than 40 years. Ms. Votta, 81, made use of audible signals in Manhattan when she taught music at the 59th Street headquarters of the charitable organization for the visually impaired known as the Lighthouse. She occasionally encounters an audible signal when she takes her guide dog, a yellow Labrador retriever, to the veterinarians at the Animal Medical Center on the Upper East Side. \u201cThey really are very helpful,\u201d Ms. Votta said, especially at intersections where it otherwise would be easy to find yourself and your guide dog headed in the wrong direction. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be lined up the right way,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re facing diagonally, the dog\u2019s going to take you that way.\u201d Ms. Votta said she and her husband Pat, who is also blind but uses a cane, go out of their way to reach certain places in the neighborhood, including a favorite diner, because some intersections are just too dangerous. She said she hoped the court\u2019s ruling would force the city to install more audible signals soon in Brooklyn Heights and throughout the city. \u201cThe whole deal for me is let\u2019s make the playing field even,\u201d Ms. Votta said. \u201cIf you can see, you\u2019ve got a much better chance of not getting killed than I have.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Biden introduces his economic team at a moment of big risks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced key members of his economic team on Tuesday, as he prepares to assume the White House at a moment when the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing and millions remain out of work. Mr. Biden, speaking at an event in Delaware, said he was building \u201ca first-rate team that\u2019s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis.\u201d The president-elect called on Congress to pass a \u201crobust\u201d rescue package to help households, businesses and state and local governments, saying many communities are \u201cteetering on the edge.\u201d Mr. Biden is poised to enter the White House at a time of national crisis amid the worsening virus outbreak. The Department of Labor and Department of Commerce have reported an increase in applications for state jobless benefits and a decrease in personal income. Coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks, a development that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell called \u201cconcerning\u201d in testimony before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it \u201ccould prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d In a sign of how critical a role economic policy will play in the Biden administration, the President-elect said he was returning the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers to a cabinet-level position. President Trump had demoted the C.E.A. chair during his administration. Mr. Biden has chosen Cecilia Rouse to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; she would be the first Black woman in the role. Ms. Rouse is a Princeton economist who worked on the Council of Economic Advisers during part of the Obama era and on the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Mr. Biden has warned of a \u201cvery dark winter\u201d ahead and called on Congress to pass relief to help workers, businesses, and state and local governments. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are preparing for what could be another economic downturn in early 2021. But another economic stimulus package has languished in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach a deal, though leaders of both parties have called for compromise in recent days. A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a potential compromise plan on Tuesday morning that appeared to fit the contours of what Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have said must frame any stimulus deal in Washington. They include additional aid to the unemployed and small businesses, along with money to help state and local governments patch budget holes that have been ripped open during the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s slate of nominees and appointees includes several women in top economic roles. The selections, markedly different from Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has been overwhelmingly white and male, follow Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise to build an administration that looks like America. His pick for the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress \u2014 would be the first Indian-American to lead the office if confirmed. Mr. Biden also selected Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, to be his Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to fill the position. Ms. Tanden has met immediate resistance from Republican senators who have criticized her for attacking Republicans publicly, including on her Twitter feed. She previewed the group\u2019s likely emphasis on personal stories in a Twitter post on Monday, after her nomination was announced: \u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity.\u201d Mr. Biden also announced his picks for deputy treasury secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, and members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Mr. Adeyemo served as a senior international economic adviser under former President Barack Obama, and Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey, a top policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, leads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality. The introductions follow a similar event last week, when Mr. Biden publicly introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team.",

    "article_text": "Long-Term-Care Residents and Health Workers Should Get Vaccine First, C.D.C. Panel Says WASHINGTON \u2014 An independent panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Tuesday to recommend that residents and employees of nursing homes and similar facilities be the first people in the United States to receive coronavirus vaccines, along with health care workers who are especially at risk of being exposed to the virus. The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, voted 13 to 1 during an emergency meeting to make the recommendation. The director of the C.D.C., Dr. Robert R. Redfield, is expected to decide by Wednesday whether to accept it as the agency\u2019s formal guidance to states as they prepare to start giving people the shots as soon as two weeks from now. \u201cWe are acting none too soon,\u201d said Dr. Beth Bell, a panel member and global health expert at the University of Washington, noting that Covid-19 would kill about 120 Americans during the meeting alone. States are not required to follow the panel\u2019s recommendations, but they usually do. The final decision will rest with governors, who are consulting with their top health officials as they complete distribution plans. The new recommendation is the first of several expected from the panel over the coming weeks, as vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna go through the federal approval process, on the thorny question of which Americans should be at the front of the long line to get vaccinated while supply is still scarce. The panel described it as an interim recommendation that could change as more is learned about how well the vaccines work in different age groups and how well the manufacturers keep up with demand. The roughly three million people living in long-term care and those who care for them are a relatively clear target; 39 percent of deaths from the coronavirus have occurred in such facilities, according to an analysis by The New York Times. But states and health systems will ultimately have to decide which of the nation\u2019s 21 million health care workers should qualify to receive the first doses, as there won\u2019t be enough at first for everyone. Pfizer and Moderna have estimated that they will have enough to vaccinate, at most, 22.5 million Americans by year\u2019s end, with the required two doses, a few weeks apart. The C.D.C. will apportion the supply among the states, with the initial allocation proportional to the size of each state\u2019s adult population. The only member of the committee to vote against the recommendation was Dr. Helen Talbot, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, who expressed discomfort with putting long-term-care residents in the first priority group because the vaccines\u2019 safety had not been studied in that particular population. \u201cWe enter this realm of \u2018we hope it works and we hope it\u2019s safe,\u2019 and that concerns me on many levels,\u201d she said before the vote. But most panel members who offered opinions said they thought the high death rate among that group made it imperative to include it. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Romero, the chairman of the panel, said that he felt strongly that its process had adhered to its core principles: \u201cmaximizing benefit and minimizing harm,\u201d promoting justice and addressing health inequities. Dr. Beth Bell, the co-chair, acknowledged that all of the members would have liked more data from clinical trials but said that because of the pandemic emergency, \u201cwe need to act.\u201d The panel, whose 14 voting members have expertise in vaccinology, immunology, virology, public health and other relevant fields, has hinted that the next priority group it will recommend for vaccination \u2014 \u201cPhase 1b\u201d \u2014 will be so-called essential workers, a huge group numbering more than 85 million. A division of the Department of Homeland Security has come up with a list of workers states should consider counting in that group; it includes teachers and others who work in schools, emergency responders, police officers, grocery workers, corrections officers, public transit workers and others whose jobs make it hard or impossible to work from home. After essential workers, the committee is leaning toward recommending vaccination of adults with medical conditions that put them at high risk of coronavirus infection, such as diabetes or obesity, and everyone over 65. But some states might diverge to an extent, possibly choosing, for example, to vaccinate residents over 75 and then some types of essential workers. All other adults would follow the initial groups. The vaccine has not yet been thoroughly studied in children, so people under 18 would not be eligible yet. For at least a month or two, there will not be nearly enough vaccine to cover everyone in the initial groups. Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who leads the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday morning in an interview with The Washington Post that Pfizer and Moderna would be able to provide an additional 60 to 70 million doses in January \u201cif all goes well.\u201d Since each person gets two shots, that would only be enough for 55 million people at most through the end of January \u2014 about 22 percent of the nation\u2019s roughly 255 million adults. Production will continue to increase in February and March, Dr. Slaoui said, with the hope that two new vaccines, from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, will gain F.D.A. approval. \u201cSo very quickly, we start having more than 150 million doses a month in March, April, May,\u201d he added. He and other federal officials have said that the general public is likely to be able to be vaccinated by May or June. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The C.D.C. panel was originally not supposed to vote on its recommendations until after the F.D.A. had approved a vaccine. But it bumped up the timing to give states more guidance as they complete their distribution plans, which must be submitted to the C.D.C. on Friday. On Tuesday, the group specifically suggested that within the long-term-care population, residents of nursing homes, who tend to be the most frail and susceptible to Covid, should get the first vaccines in the event that there aren\u2019t enough, along with staff members who have not had the virus within the last 90 days. Within the much larger category of health care workers, the panel said that health systems should consider prioritizing those who have direct contact with patients and their families and those who handle infectious materials. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who leads the C.D.C.\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the panel that based on her recent conversations with state health officials, most states and large cities \u201cbelieve they can vaccinate all of their health care workers within three weeks.\u201d But whether they reach that goal depends on how much vaccine they get, and how quickly. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky told reporters on Monday that his state had more than 200,000 health care workers but would receive only 38,000 doses in its first shipment and that it might not get another for two weeks. Long-term-care facilities include nursing homes, with about 1.3 million residents; assisted-living facilities, with 800,000 residents; and residential care facilities, which tend to be small and cater to specific populations. The federal government has contracted with CVS and Walgreens to deliver vaccines to most such facilities nationwide, with teams of pharmacists making three visits to each to ensure that every staff member and resident gets both an initial shot and a booster shot several weeks later. Several members of the panel urged that small community doctors\u2019 offices not be left off the initial priority list. \u201cTransmission dynamics suggest providers who care for patients earlier in their course of illness may be at higher risk,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a member of the panel who is in charge of public health in Seattle and King County, Wash. Dr. Grace Lee, a panel member and a pediatrics professor at Stanford, said special attention should be paid to health care workers in lower-paying positions, such as nursing assistants, food workers and janitors, who may fear for their job security if they push to secure a spot toward the front of the vaccination line. \u201cI am very mindful of the equity concerns,\u201d Dr. Lee said.

    "article_text": "In England, Rumbles of Discontent as Parliament Votes to Exit Lockdown LONDON \u2014 Much of England will swap lockdown for less stringent coronavirus restrictions, after Parliament approved new rules on Tuesday despite a substantial revolt among lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party. The rebellion, by lawmakers who want to go farther in easing the limits on public life, underscored the rising tide of discontent among Mr. Johnson\u2019s own members of Parliament over his handling of the pandemic, exacerbated by fears that the curbs could lay waste to large swathes of the hospitality industry. Caught between the competing demands of this vocal faction of his lawmakers, and those of his more cautious scientific advisers, Mr. Johnson opted to keep stringent measures in place, including restrictions on many pubs and restaurants. From Wednesday there will be some relaxation from the lockdown in all areas, as all stores, gyms, and hairdressers will be allowed to reopen. Religious services and weddings can restart, and limited numbers of spectators will be allowed at some outdoor sporting events. But England will return to a system under which coronavirus restrictions differ from place to place, with areas of the country divided into three \u201ctiers\u201d based on an assessment of the coronavirus risks in each one. That is similar to the framework in place earlier in the year, which failed to prevent a second wave of the pandemic or avert last month\u2019s lockdown. So this time \u2014 and to the anger of many Conservative lawmakers \u2014 almost all of England will be in the top two tiers, placing significant restrictions on the hospitality trade in areas where around 55 million people live. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own coronavirus rules. A large part of England, home to around 23 million people, will be in the strictest tier, where pubs and restaurants will be shut except for takeout service. In regions placed in the middle tier, including London, pubs will only be able to serve alcohol to customers who order a \u201csubstantial meal\u201d \u2014 a condition that the government has struggled to explain when asked which types of food qualify. As well as tripping up ministers, the debate over such loopholes has underscored the extent to which the state is dictating the minutiae of daily life, something that makes libertarian Conservative lawmakers distinctly queasy. On Tuesday, critics in Parliament included several mainstays of the Conservative establishment like Graham Brady, who chairs an influential group of lawmakers. \u201cIf government is to take away fundamental liberties of the people whom we represent they must illustrate beyond question they are acting in a way that is both proportionate and absolutely necessary,\u201d said Mr. Brady, before concluding that the government had \u201cfailed to make that compelling case.\u201d His comments came after Mr. Johnson sought to placate critics, arguing that with the arrival of the vaccine on the horizon, \u201cthere is an end in sight,\u201d but adding: \u201cwe cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter.\u201d The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s vote in Parliament, which Mr. Johnson won by 291 to 78 was never in doubt after a decision by the opposition Labour Party to abstain. Presented with a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Labour\u2019s leader, Keir Starmer, told his lawmakers not to vote, saying that he did not want to stop the only set of restrictions available and therefore would not vote against them. He also said he did not want to endorse measures he described as insufficient and likely to fail. Mr. Starmer, who has recently ramped up criticism of the government\u2019s handling on the pandemic, also called for more financial support for those struggling from the economic fallout. Surveys generally show the public supports tough measures to control the spread of the virus and prevent the health service being overwhelmed, and Mr. Johnson\u2019s government is hardly unique in the dilemmas it faces. After a new rise of infections in Wales, all pubs will be banned from serving alcohol, starting on Friday, with the hospitality sector restricted by a 6 p.m. curfew. Yet the scale of the Conservative revolt served a warning to Mr. Johnson, denting the authority of a government whose majority in Parliament looks less than solid only a year after he won a landslide election victory. More than 50 of the 364 Conservative members of Parliament voted against the new measures on Tuesday \u2014 the biggest rebellion against Mr. Johnson since the election. Last month, 34 Conservative lawmakers voted against the lockdown measures. Many Conservative lawmakers had demanded an assessment of the economic impact of the new restrictions but were dissatisfied with a subsequent government document that they felt was largely a rehash of material already published. Aside from those who object to the new rules on libertarian grounds, several Conservative lawmakers disputed decisions to place the areas they represent in tier three of the restrictions, with the most stringent curbs. The next highest category, tier two, where pubs can reopen but can only serve alcohol alongside a substantial meal, effectively forces bars that do not offer food to close. But those rules have also prompted a lively debate about whether pubs can serve drinks alongside some less sophisticated British staples, including a Scotch egg \u2014 a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in bread crumbs and then deep-fried. Questioned on this topic, one minister, George Eustice, said on Monday that the Scotch egg would qualify as a substantial meal. Then on Tuesday, his cabinet colleague Michael Gove referred to it as a starter \u2014 rather than a main course \u2014 only to appear to contradict himself in another interview and suggest that it passed the pub meal test. The loophole for pub goers was seized on by the Sun newspaper, which predicted what many drinkers would order when pubs finally open in tier two areas on Wednesday. \u201cTen pints of lager \u2026 and a Scotch egg please,\u201d read its banner headline.",

    "article_text": "The U.S. and Britain race to authorize Covid-19 vaccines. The race to be the first nation to authorize a rigorously tested Covid-19 vaccine is intensifying. British regulators are considering two vaccines for emergency approval: one developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and another by Pfizer and BioNTech. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a vaccine manufacturing facility in Wales on Monday, boasting that \u201cif we\u2019re lucky, if everything goes, right, this could be available just in a few weeks.\u201d \u201cThis could, and I stress could, really be the salvation for humanity, these vaccines,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Across the Atlantic, Mark Meadows, President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, summoned the F.D.A. commissioner, Stephen Hahn, to the White House on Tuesday morning to explain why regulators have not yet approved the emergency use of the vaccine developed by Pfizer, according to people familiar with the situation. One official said Mr. Meadows was concerned that the British government may approve emergency use of a coronavirus vaccine before American regulators act, potentially embarrassing the Trump administration. Mr. Trump and Mr. Meadows have pressured the F.D.A. for months to speed up the development and approval of a vaccine, and allies of Dr. Hahn are worried that he could be fired if he fails to satisfy the White House demands. On Tuesday, the White House said that Mr. Trump will host a \u201cCovid-19 Vaccine Summit\u201d next week, two days before a panel of outside advisers to the F.D.A. meets to decide whether the agency should grant emergency approval to the Pfizer vaccine. Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, will also attend the meeting with private sector executives and governors. The global race to develop a vaccine is poised to shatter records for time to market. Around the world, researchers are testing 57 vaccines in clinical trials, and nearly 100 others are being tested in animals or cells. China and Russia have approved vaccines without waiting for the results of late-stage trials, known as Phase 3, which experts say raises serious risks. Britain and the United States vet vaccine candidates differently: American regulators pore over raw data from vaccine makers to validate their results, while regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe lean more heavily on companies\u2019 own analyses. The European Union is also set to conduct its own review of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. The companies announced on Tuesday that they had submitted their final application to the bloc\u2019s health authorities. Moderna announced on Monday that it had also applied for approval for the European market and in the United States. But creating a vaccine is only the first step in what will be a gargantuan feat of logistics: injecting enough people around the world to stop a pandemic in which more than 63 million people have been infected and 1.4 million have died. The United States, Britain and other rich countries have bought massive quantities of doses, but will still have to figure out how to ship, store and distribute them. The Pfizer vaccine brings particular challenges: It must be stored in an ultracold freezer. That quandary already appeared to be affecting distribution plans in Britain. Nursing-home residents were supposed to be Britain\u2019s top priority under an advisory committee\u2019s plans, but a limit on how many times officials believe the Pfizer vaccine can be moved before it loses effectiveness likely means that National Health Service staff members will receive the shots first. In the United States, states largely devise plans for vaccine distribution, but are likely to follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An advisory committee was meeting on Tuesday to discuss those. Governments and health care organizations must also figure out how to overcome mistrust and concern about the vaccine\u2019s safety. On Monday, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Francesco Rocca, warned that misinformation and distrust could torpedo vaccination campaigns. \u201cTo beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust,\u201d he said.

    "article_text": "Without Crowds, Is Times Square Really Times Square? Take a Look A tour bus agent desperately tried to discern which passers-by were New Yorkers and which ones were out-of-towners. Newlyweds from Maryland, hoping to celebrate their nuptials with a special dinner, had to settle for McDonald\u2019s. Four homeless men sat on a sidewalk, sharing cigarettes and a pipe filled with marijuana. This is Times Square, jarringly quiet beneath flashing billboards. Times Square needs a crowd, which is as much a part of its character as the incessant lights. \u201cLook around,\u201d said Ronnie Boyd, 54, from Brooklyn, who has been selling souvenir hats and T-shirts on the sidewalk in the area since 2004. \u201cWithout the Broadway shows, the office workers, the tourists, the crowds, you got no Times Square.\u201d The throngs of visitors \u2014 the trademark of the famous neighborhood for more than a century \u2014 are gone. The air is no longer thick with the aroma of hot dogs and roasting nuts. Broadway theaters are closed. Office buildings, which drew a daily work force of millions, are nearly vacant. And there is an eeriness to the emptiness, helping to stir the faint fear that Times Square could slip back to its 1970s self, a seamy neighborhood known for open crime, drugs and sex shows. The neighborhood\u2019s transformation \u2014 from gritty to \u201cDisney\u201d \u2014 was a significant chapter in the revitalization of New York City, even as detractors criticized the new Times Square as losing its edge. Times Square has an outsized share of the city\u2019s economic activity, despite occupying only 0.1 percent of the city\u2019s land mass, said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, the area\u2019s business improvement district. Before the pandemic, the square, where Broadway meets Seventh Avenue from 42nd to 47th streets, helped to draw a crush of tourists to the city. A record 66.6 million visited the city in 2019, with many making their way to a show, the New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop or to a little patch of sidewalk just to stand beneath all those lights. That level of tourism is not likely to return until 2024, according to one forecast. Times Square is now a microcosm of the city\u2019s struggle to survive the pandemic, as restaurants and businesses close and residents lose their jobs. There are no crowds to shield and disguise the population of homeless people, mostly men, living there on the street. \u201cTimes Square has always been New York on steroids, so whatever is happening in New York City is amplified in Times Square,\u201d said Mr. Tompkins. Beginning in August, overnight counts tallied by Times Square Alliance staffers reported that the number of people sleeping on the street in Times Square was roughly double the 2019 levels, and many are \u201cmuch more aggressive with passers-by or are ignoring social distancing,\u201d said Mr. Tompkins. Despite the shortage of tourists, Ruth Njuguna, the tour bus agent, still searched for likely customers to consider her sales pitch, passing out pamphlets and wearing a placard around her neck bearing her name, \u201cMiss Ruth.\u201d \u201cPeople came from all over the world to Times Square, and now they\u2019re just not coming,\u201d she said. Before the pandemic, willing tourists would buy up to 100 tickets a day, Ms. Njuguna said, which allowed her to support her two children in the Bronx and send some money home to relatives in Kenya. Now, there are days when she may sell merely two or three tickets. Visitors have slowly returned, especially on nights and weekends. And the district has re-emerged occasionally as a central gathering spot for events such as Black Lives Matter protests and celebrations after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory was declared. Still, the district feels empty by Times Square standards. About 108,000 pedestrians pass through the area each day compared with 380,000 before the pandemic. Over the extended Thanksgiving weekend, Times Square had a third of the usual foot traffic, the alliance said. Mr. Tompkins said it was still unclear whether December would bring a holiday bump, given the pandemic restrictions. The office towers largely remain empty, and most of the hotels in the area have closed, at least temporarily, including the 478-room Hilton Times Square, as have stores like Old Navy and the U.S. Polo Association. Restaurants such as Planet Hollywood, the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and Dave and Buster\u2019s have not yet reopened. Between March and the end of October, at least 26 of the 46 hotels in the Times Square area shut, at least temporarily, the alliance said, and 39 of the 151 retailers closed, as did 84 of the 162 restaurants. Of the two multiplexes on 42nd Street, the Regal has closed permanently and the AMC Empire 25, the top-grossing theater in the country, remains closed because of city restrictions on movie theaters. The annual New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop, which draws crowds of more than one million, will be held without live spectators this year. Broadway theaters will remain closed at least until June, and few believe any substantial comeback in the area will happen before that. Formerly known as Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to a newly erected building at what is now One Times Square, the site of the annual New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop. After World War I, it became a cultural hub full of theaters, music halls and upscale hotels, as well as the city\u2019s main gathering spot, but by the 1960s the area had grown increasingly seedy \u2014 rife with go-go bars, sex shops, peep shows and adult theaters. It became synonymous with the city\u2019s decline through the 1970s and 1980s as crime rates soared, before city and state officials in the 1990s took over the revitalization of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. Now, Times Square may feel sketchier without the festive crowds, but the sharp decline in visitors and workers has actually caused a drop in crime. The total number of major crimes in the Midtown South precinct, which covers much of Times Square, has declined so far this year by nearly 22 percent, compared to the same time period last year. With fewer visitors, the number of grand larcenies, which often involve electronics and credit cards, dropped from 1,718 last year to 1,026 so far this year, while there has been a rise in burglaries, most likely of closed stores and restaurants. The pandemic came down hardest on Times Square\u2019s anchor block, 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, which is now a shadow of its pre-pandemic self. The block saw a 70 percent decline in pedestrian traffic compared to last year, according to a study conducted by the alliance. Roughly 80 percent of its businesses are now closed or inactive, including theaters where \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d were playing when the lockdown came. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single block that went so quickly and so hard from everything blooming in full to everything shut down,\u201d Mr. Tompkins said. \u201cThe city and state spent two decades and tens of millions of dollars turning it around. It was a major economic engine, and it has completely shut down.\u201d Alan Rosen owns two outposts of Junior\u2019s Restaurant in Times Square that were among the busiest independent restaurants in the country last year, having served nearly two million diners combined. Their kitschy New York deli d\u00e9cor lies darkened behind locked doors. Although indoor dining is permitted at 25 percent capacity in the city, Mr. Rosen has visited Times Square recently to \u201cfeel the vibe\u201d and has decided he still cannot open because the area is too quiet. \u201cThere are people who say it\u2019s going to back to the way it was in the \u201970s,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. He said that he is not one of those naysayers, but rather believes that Times Square will bounce back with the return of Broadway, tourism, hotel use and office workers. For now though, there are no crowds, and vulnerable people living on the street are more visible. People who have no housing have been pushed out of the subway system since it began closing each night from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. for cleaning. To combat the spread of coronavirus, the city removed thousands of people from crowded shelters and into hotels emptied of tourists. Advocates say many newly arrived homeless people also have left crowded shelters on their own, taking their chances on the streets during the pandemic. In the hotels, two strangers generally share a room, an arrangement that can also spread the virus. One of those new residents on the street in Times Square is Shakeem Lofton, 45. He reclined on a blue blanket and a pillow propped up against a newsstand on Seventh Avenue near West 44th Street on a recent weekday and said he had left an uptown Manhattan shelter because of virus fears and had chosen this location because it seemed like the best spot to panhandle. \u201cI figured I\u2019d be safer taking my chances on the street than sleeping next to all those people,\u201d he said. On another day, Benjamin Creel, 35, sat with three other homeless men who shared cigarettes and a pipe filled with marijuana. \u201cA year ago, we couldn\u2019t even be sitting here because the crowds were so thick \u2014 now there\u2019s barely anyone on the sidewalk,\u201d said Mr. Creel, adding that the number of new homeless people in Times Square has increased during the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely seeing more, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Mr. Creel who said he has lived on the city\u2019s streets, on and off, since first arriving six years after losing his roofing job in Elmira, N.Y., and going through a divorce. His survival strategy involved panhandling with a cardboard sign bearing the message \u201cI Need Weed,\u201d which was both true and a good sales pitch, he said. \u201cBefore Covid, I could clear 80 to 100 bucks a day on the street \u2014 sometimes you get a tourist to throw you a 20,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the pandemic, there\u2019s no tourist and no festivities going on, and New Yorkers are struggling too, so I\u2019m lucky if I make 10 bucks a day.\u201d Ismael Guillen, 25, and Jennifer Medrano, 19, from Pasadena, Md., stood in a nearly deserted pedestrian plaza near 44th Street on a recent weekday. Perhaps nothing is more striking about Times Square than the sheer emptiness of it, compared to its pre-pandemic self, something that was not lost on the newlyweds. The couple took a few rare days off from their jobs at Chick-fil-A for a brief honeymoon in Times Square. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not what I expected, compared to the crowded Times Square you see in the movies and pictures,\u201d Ms. Medrano said. Mr. Guillen said he had visited several times before, including ringing in 2018 on New Year\u2019s Eve with packed crowds. Knowing Times Square\u2019s reputation for late night activity, the couple went out after 9 p.m. one evening for dinner and tried the Hard Rock Cafe, Red Lobster and the Olive Garden, but all were closed. They ate at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the same place, but it\u2019s a totally different experience,\u201d Mr. Guillen said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally opposite of what it used to be.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Who Will Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First? After months of deliberation and debate, a panel of independent experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Tuesday to recommend that health care workers who are most at risk of contracting Covid-19, along with residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, be the first Americans to receive coronavirus vaccinations.  If the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, approves the recommendation, it will be shared with states, which are preparing to receive their first vaccine shipments as soon as mid-December, if the Food and Drug Administration approves an application for emergency use of a vaccine developed by Pfizer. States don\u2019t have to follow the C.D.C.\u2019s recommendations, but most probably will, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which represents state health agencies. The panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will meet again soon to vote on which groups should be next to receive priority. Here are answers to some common questions about the vaccine and its distribution. The C.D.C. committee recommended that the nation\u2019s 21 million health care workers be eligible before anyone else, along with three million mostly elderly people living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. A staggering 39 percent of deaths from the coronavirus have occurred in long-term care facilities, according to an analysis by The New York Times.  But there won\u2019t be enough doses at first to vaccinate everyone in these groups; Pfizer and Moderna, the two companies closest to gaining approval for their vaccines, have estimated that they will have enough to vaccinate no more than 22.5 million Americans by January. So each state will have to decide which health care workers go first. They may choose to prioritize critical care doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists and other hospital employees, including cleaning staff, who are most likely to be exposed to the coronavirus. Or they may offer the vaccine to older health care workers first, or those working in nursing homes, who are at higher risk of contracting the virus. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said on Monday that most of his state\u2019s initial allocation would go to residents and employees of long-term care facilities, with a smaller amount going to hospital workers. It\u2019s important to remember that everyone who gets a vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna will need a second shot \u2014 three weeks later for Pfizer\u2019s, four weeks for Moderna\u2019s. The C.D.C. committee hinted last week that it would recommend essential workers be next in line. About 87 million Americans work in food and agriculture, manufacturing, law enforcement, education, transportation, corrections, emergency response and other sectors. They are at increased risk of exposure to the virus because their jobs preclude them from working from home. And these workers are disproportionately Black and Hispanic, populations that have been hit especially hard by the virus. Individual states may decide to include in this group employees of industries that have been particularly affected by the virus. Arkansas, for example, has proposed including workers in its large poultry industry, while Colorado wants to include ski industry workers who live in congregate housing. After essential workers, the priority groups likely to be recommended by the C.D.C. committee are adults with medical conditions that put them at high risk of coronavirus infection, and people over 65. But again, some states might diverge to an extent, choosing, for example, to vaccinate residents over 75 before some types of essential workers. All other adults would follow. The vaccine has not yet been thoroughly studied in children, so they would not be eligible yet. Each state has a working group, composed largely of public health officials, that has been planning for months and making decisions about vaccination campaigns. Each state\u2019s top health official and governor will probably sign off on final plans. States don\u2019t need to reach everyone in one priority group before moving on to the next, according to the C.D.C. advisory committee. But more federal guidance is expected on the subject. Federal officials have said they plan to ship the first 6.4 million doses within 24 hours after the F.D.A. authorizes a vaccine, and the number each state receives will be based on a formula that considers its adult population. Pfizer will ship special coolers, each containing at least 1,000 doses, directly to locations determined by each state\u2019s governor. At first, almost all of those sites will probably be hospitals that have confirmed they can store shipments at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, as the Pfizer vaccine requires, or use them quickly. Federal officials have repeatedly suggested that people who are not in the priority groups \u2014 healthy adults under 65 who don\u2019t work in health care or otherwise qualify as essential workers \u2014 should have access to the vaccine by May or June, because there will be enough supply by then. But a lot will have to go right for that to happen. One factor is whether, or when, other vaccines besides Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s are approved. Once the vaccine becomes widely available, most people will be able to get it in doctor\u2019s offices and at pharmacies.  Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Employers do have the right to compel their workers to be vaccinated. Many hospital systems, for example, require annual flu shots. But employees can seek exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs. In such cases, employers are supposed to provide a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d; with a coronavirus vaccine, a worker might be allowed to wear a mask in the office instead, or to work from home. This depends on a number of factors, including the supply in your area at the time you\u2019re vaccinated and whether certain vaccines are found to be more effective in certain populations, such as older adults. At first, the only choice is likely to be Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, assuming it is approved. Moderna asked the F.D.A. for emergency authorization on Monday; if approved, it would most likely become available within weeks after Pfizer\u2019s. Some participants in both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s trials have said they experienced symptoms including fever, muscle aches, bad headaches and fatigue after receiving the shots, but the side effects generally did not last more than a day. Still, preliminary data suggests that, compared with most flu vaccines, the coronavirus shots have a somewhat higher rate of such reactions, which are almost always normal signs that the body\u2019s immune response is kicking in. At the meeting of the C.D.C. advisory committee last week, some members said it would be important for doctors to warn their patients about possible side effects and assure them of the vaccines\u2019 safety. Each company\u2019s application to the F.D.A. includes two months of follow-up safety data from Phase 3 of clinical trials conducted by universities and other independent bodies. In that phase, tens of thousands of volunteers get a vaccine and wait to see if they become infected, compared with others who receive a placebo. By September, Pfizer\u2019s trial had 44,000 participants; no serious safety concerns have been reported. The F.D.A. will also review the data for each vaccine seeking authorization and share it with its advisory committee, which will meet publicly \u2014 in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, on Dec. 10 \u2014 to ask questions and make a recommendation to the agency. The F.D.A. will then decide whether to approve the vaccine for emergency use. Probably. Although people who have contracted the virus do have immunity, it is too soon to know how long it lasts. So for now, it makes sense for them to get the shot. The question is when. Some members of the C.D.C. advisory committee have suggested Covid survivors should be toward the back of the line. \u201cAt the beginning, when it\u2019s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible,\u201d Dr. Robert Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who serves on the committee, said during a meeting of the panel last week.

    "article_text": "U.K. National Theater Enters the Streaming Wars LONDON \u2014 Cultural institutions around the world have been pivoting to online this year, and Britain\u2019s National Theater has arguably been one of the most successful. From April to July, with its stages shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic and many of its staff furloughed, the theater put recordings of recent hits on YouTube, starting with the wildly popular comedy \u201cOne Man, Two Guvnors.\u201d Those videos got over 15 million views in total. Last week, it also made a recording of its latest production, \u201cDeath of England: Delroy\u201d \u2014 which closed the night it opened, because of a second national lockdown in England \u2014 available to view free for 24 hours. Now, the theater has decided to change tack. Just days before it reopens for a second time this year with \u201cDick Whittington,\u201d a family Christmas show, it has started its own streaming service \u2014 National Theater at Home \u2014 costing $12.99 plus tax for a monthly subscription, and with a pay-per-view option for individual plays. The service offers 11 plays at launch on Tuesday, including Michael Longhurst\u2019s 2016 production of \u201cAmadeus,\u201d telling the story of Mozart\u2019s rivalry with Antonio Salieri, and Nicholas Hytner\u2019s 2009 production of Racine\u2019s \u201cPh\u00e8dre\u201d starring Helen Mirren. There is also a musical for children, \u201cI Want My Hat Back.\u201d The reason for the new approach was simple, said Rufus Norris, the theater\u2019s artistic director, in a telephone interview: money. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable in the long term to keep it free,\u201d he said. The National Theater asked for donations when it streamed plays on YouTube, and received about 350,000 pounds, roughly $467,000. That worked out at just a few cents per stream. This wasn\u2019t enough for the theater, or the actors, writers and directors involved in the productions, Norris said. \u201cObviously our target is people who love theater,\u201d Norris said, when asked if the service could compete with the likes of Netflix and HBO Max. \u201cBut it\u2019ll let other people see the actors they love in a completely different context,\u201d he added. The initial slate of plays includes performances by Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Michaela Coel. In an interview, Norris also talked about what the National\u2019s move meant for other theaters, the challenges of switching to a paid service and streaming\u2019s prospects once theaters return. These are edited extracts. Your lockdown streaming efforts were already so successful. Why decide to change approach? The theater\u2019s in a perilous situation, like all theaters are over the world, and we\u2019re facing some very difficult circumstances due to lockdown coming back, social distancing still going on. So it felt like what we had to do. We\u2019ve kept the subscription fee as low as we can. But another reason is, this period has been particularly perilous for the artists on whose work we build everything: the actors, writers. And this subscription model means that we can \u2014 to a degree \u2014 make sure that they\u2019re benefiting from it. They\u2019ll get a share of any income that we make. I understand this has been in the works for months. Has negotiating payments to artists been the biggest challenge? Yes. When we launched on YouTube, it was a very, very quick idea \u2014 just contacting everybody and saying, \u201cLook, we\u2019re closed, is this something we can do for free?\u201d And everybody immediately piled in and said \u201cYes.\u201d But at that stage none of them, and none of us, knew how long this was going to go on for, or that freelance artists would be struggling so much within it. As soon as that became apparent, we immediately started paying fees and back pay for the films we\u2019d put online. This is trying to make that sustainable: We\u2019d love to be able to make our plays free all the time, but that\u2019s just not the world that we\u2019re in. Musicians with work on streaming services complain they need millions of views to make anywhere near minimum wage. Do you expect a similar response? They\u2019ll all get paid, whatever happens. Do you think there\u2019s no alternative for theaters but to go online now? We\u2019re in such a fluid situation at the moment, it\u2019s really hard to predict what the world\u2019s going to be like in one month, let alone six, let alone two years. We\u2019ll be keeping a very beady eye on how much demand there is for it. And as we start to return to normal whether there\u2019s any measurable negative impact on attendance in our actual theaters, which obviously is completely the opposite of what we intend. The degree theaters have embraced digital during this time, and certainly the audiences have, would suggest the two can happily coexist. I can imagine theater lovers who can afford the fee will love this, but some theaters might think, \u201cOh, God, how can I compete against the National with its reputation and star names?\u201d Is there room for everyone? I just don\u2019t know. In the end, there\u2019s a huge audience out there with very varied tastes, and there are many initiatives that have found their own market in lockdown. We do bring other theaters on in terms of the work we\u2019re doing. This will have on it a show from the Donmar Warehouse, and one from the Young Vic, in London. We\u2019re trying to do more. The National in its early days \u2014 the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 had legendary actors like Laurence Olivier performing. Will people eventually see very old grainy footage of them on the site too? I\u2019m not sure how far the archive goes back, to be honest. The older films will be very simple and they were made more as a record for archive purposes, or in case the production was being remounted. So I couldn\u2019t speak to whether the quality would even be good enough. Where should a new viewer begin? I\u2019m biased toward \u201cMosquitoes\u201d because it\u2019s a production that I directed. And Olivia Colman\u2019s wonderful in it. But actually Inua Ellams\u2019s \u201cThree Sisters\u201d was a very, very beautiful production recently, and \u201cAmadeus\u201d is fantastic. I could keep on going!",

    "article_text": "Scott Atlas, a Trump Coronavirus Adviser, Resigns WASHINGTON \u2014 Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused controversial theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, resigned his White House position on Monday. The move was not entirely unexpected. Dr. Atlas joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term after he caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with his frequent appearances on Fox News over the summer. Dr. Atlas\u2019s term was set to expire this week. \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus \u2014 to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Atlas wrote in a letter that he posted Monday night on Twitter, adding, \u201cI always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d Fox News earlier reported his resignation. Honored to have served @realDonaldTrump and the American people during these difficult times. pic.twitter.com/xT1hRoYBMh But some of Dr. Atlas\u2019s Trump administration colleagues would most likely contradict that assessment, citing views starkly different from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by other government scientists. Dr. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot spread the coronavirus. Even more contentious was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Dr. Atlas\u2019s view, the government\u2019s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as Covid-19 took its course. His argument was that most people infected with the coronavirus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people would have antibodies from Covid-19 to deprive the virus of carriers \u2014 so-called herd immunity. Dr. Atlas also railed against anything that smacked of a lockdown or business closure. \u201cProtect the high-risk; open schools, society,\u201d he tweeted in October. \u201cAlternative? Confine healthy people, restrict business, close schools\u2026kills people, destroys families, sacrifices kids. #RationalThinking.\u201d Public health experts were appalled and warned that his ideas were dangerous and would have disastrous results. But that did not stop Dr. Atlas. In mid-November, he called on people in Michigan to \u201crise up\u201d against coronavirus restrictions. The state\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who had faced death threats and a thwarted kidnapping attempt over the restrictions, denounced him as \u201cincredibly reckless.\u201d But in his resignation letter and the accompanying tweet, Dr. Atlas defended himself. \u201cWe also identified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd more and more,\u201d he added, \u201cthe relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged.\u201d Inside the administration, Dr. Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator. While Dr. Atlas was playing down the necessity of wearing masks, Dr. Birx was traveling the country preaching the opposite. She implored governors and public health officials in hard-hit states to take more aggressive steps. The two also clashed repeatedly in private. But Dr. Atlas\u2019s disagreements with Dr. Fauci were more visceral \u2014 and more public. After the election, Dr. Atlas accused Dr. Fauci of being a \u201cpolitical animal\u201d who changed his assessment of the threat of the pandemic after it became clear that Mr. Trump had lost. Dr. Fauci replied in kind. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes,\u201d he said recently on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, after Dr. Atlas\u2019s comments about Michigan. \u201cI just do, period.\u201d But Dr. Atlas had the ear of the one person who mattered: Mr. Trump. \u201cHe has many great ideas,\u201d the president told reporters in August at a White House briefing, with Dr. Atlas seated feet away. \u201cAnd he thinks what we\u2019ve done is really good, and now we\u2019ll take it to a new level.\u201d",

    "article_text": "France has kept schools open without driving up infections, and other news from around the world. France\u2019s coronavirus test positivity rate, at 11.1 percent, is nearly four times that of New York City. And yet schools across France have remained open during the latest lockdown, in sharp contrast to New York City, which closed schools after its average test positivity rate climbed to 3 percent before abruptly deciding to reopen elementary schools over the weekend. Even as the virus has surged again in Europe, classrooms across the continent have largely remained open despite increasing restrictions, in a significant departure from the first lockdowns last spring. Based in part on scientific evidence that young children are low transmitters of the virus, the decisions have helped soften the pandemic\u2019s academic and economic blows. \u201cObviously, the decline has been slower because schools are open, but we had to find a middle ground,\u201d said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist and a member of France\u2019s Scientific Council, which advises the government on the pandemic. But, he added, the slower drop in infections has been offset by positive effects on education, mental health and the economy. Three months into France\u2019s school year, schools have not become a major driver of infections. Only 7,776 schoolchildren tested positive for the coronavirus last week, or just 0.06 percent of the country\u2019s 12 million schoolchildren, according to figures released by the Education Ministry. On Nov. 27, out of 61,500 schools, only 19 primary schools, three middle schools and three high schools were closed because of outbreaks. France\u2019s experience, at least so far, suggests that it is possible to flatten the curve, or bend it down, even when schools are open. A week ago, France\u2019s 14-day rate of infection was nearly 800 per 100,000 people; as of Wednesday, it had dropped to 483. With schools open, parents have been able to focus on their work at home or commuting to their workplaces, which has helped blunt the second lockdown\u2019s depression on the economy. The country has shuttered cafes and restaurants through at least mid-January, but allowed essential sectors to keep operating. The Eiffel Tower, it was announced on Tuesday, will reopen on Dec. 16; the monument, one of the biggest tourist attractions in Paris, has been closed since late October. In other global developments: Also in France, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that he was considering implementing a widespread vaccination campaign next spring after a more targeted one for health workers and vulnerable populations. Mr. Macron, speaking at a news conference in Paris alongside Alexander De Croo, the Belgian prime minister, said there would probably be a first wave of priority vaccinations in early 2021 with first-generation vaccines, which might prove logistically complex to deploy. But Mr. Macron repeated that getting a vaccine would not be mandatory, and he insisted instead on a \u201cstrategy of conviction and transparency.\u201d Hamas, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, said on Tuesday that Yehya Sinwar, its chief in the territory, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Hamas said that Mr. Sinwar was doing \u201cwell\u201d and was working while in quarantine. Vietnam suspended commercial flights on Tuesday, two days after its first case was confirmed in 89 days. Two additional cases were reported in Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday, both linked to a flight attendant who officials said violated quarantine regulations. Officials were working to trace the contacts of the three infected people, and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc urged vigilance in prevention measures. Ireland exited a six-week lockdown on Tuesday, reopening nonessential businesses, gyms and religious services. Health officials still discourage socializing, but groups of six people will be permitted inside bars and restaurants serving substantial meals starting on Friday. The Netherlands began requiring masks in public buildings on Tuesday, making it one of Europe\u2019s last countries to introduce the mandate. The government had long discouraged the use of masks, saying they promoted a false sense of security, before an abrupt shift in October when they advised people to use them. Violations under the new law will carry a fine of 95 euros, or $114. In Spain, the regional leader of Madrid, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, inaugurated her flagship infrastructure project: a new hospital on Tuesday focused on patients affected by epidemics like Covid-19. The hospital has no patients yet, as only a quarter of its infrastructure has been installed and its medical staff is incomplete. Ms. D\u00edaz Ayuso told reporters on Tuesday that \u201ca new hospital can never be bad news,\u201d but the project, which she announced in May, has come under intense criticism, with medical professionals and opposition politicians calling on her government to instead strengthen staffing and resources at existing hospitals. After a Franciscan convent in northwestern Germany without a single known Covid-19 case tested its 161 nuns, 76 of the tests came back positive on Monday, signaling a potentially dangerous cluster in a religious community with many elderly members. \u201cWe have an outbreak,\u201d Sister Maria Cordis Riker, who heads the convent, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut we are grateful that so far, the course of the disease has been mild and no one is in hospital.\u201d Local health authorities are trying to find out how the virus got into the convent, which has limited visits during the pandemic. For more than a century, the convent has maintained continuous prayer around the clock, but social distance and health regulations have obliged it to cut back to 50 percent of capacity \u2014 one nun praying at a time, instead of the usual two.",

    "article_text": "Los Angeles Reverses Decision to Close Virus Testing Site for a Film Shoot The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, said early Tuesday that the city would reopen a coronavirus testing site at Union Station, a major transit hub, after residents criticized a decision to temporarily close the site during a film shoot.  The movie, \u201cHe\u2019s All That,\u201d which features the TikTok star Addison Rae and is a reboot of the 1999 romantic comedy \u201cShe\u2019s All That,\u201d had received approval to film inside and outside the station on Tuesday, the city and county\u2019s film office said. About 170 cast and crew members were expected to take part in the movie scenes, the film office said. The reversal came after a homeless outreach and advocacy group called Ktown for All criticized the decision to close the site and shared a copy of an email that it said a resident received on Monday afternoon from the company that operates the testing site. It said that all testing appointments for Tuesday at the station had been canceled because of an event there. The group said that the move showed that the city had misplaced its priorities at a time when hospitalizations for the virus are on the rise, and that the decision to close the site for a day made it more difficult for people who rely on public transportation to get tested. \u201cIt\u2019s truly one of the only Covid testing centers within the city of Los Angeles that is really accessible by public transit,\u201d Devon Manney, a spokesman for the group, said in an interview on Monday night. \u201cThis is the L.A. that we are constantly fighting against.\u201d Philip Sokoloski, a spokesman for the film office, which is known as FilmLA, said on Monday night that neither the office nor the locations team for the production company had been aware that the station was one of the city\u2019s virus testing locations and they were not involved in the decision to close the site. Union Station is one of the city\u2019s 10 permanent testing sites and five pop-up locations, including one at the North Hollywood Metro station that is on the same rapid transit line as Union Station. City officials did not say who had made the decision to suspend testing at Union Station. In a tweet, Mr. Garcetti said the 504 people who were scheduled for a test at Union Station on Tuesday could visit the site as planned. City officials said about 350 daily tests are conducted on average at Union Station, which they said accounted for less than 1 percent of the more than 35,000 tests that are done every day in Los Angeles. A representative for Miramax, which is releasing the film, said the studio had not requested the halt to testing.  Taylor Lorenz contributed reporting.   ",

    "article_text": "A Theater Duo\u2019s \u2018Last Gasp\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Look Like the End Back in March, Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver, of the theater duo Split Britches, were in Britain, developing a new show, when Covid-19 exploded. It made more sense to stay put than to scamper back home to New York, which looked pretty scary at the time. Weaver, who has spent part of the year in London for nearly two decades, teaching performance at Queen Mary University, had a shared place there, but Shaw\u2019s accommodations across town were an issue. Luckily, neighbors of Weaver\u2019s volunteered an empty house they had been planning to gut-renovate. \u201cThere was electricity, heat, running water and one chair,\u201d Weaver, 71, said, describing the London house in a recent video call from the Catskills. Recounting the experience, she said friends and fellow theater-makers had donated furniture, and someone who was moving to a nursing home gave them kitchen equipment. \u201cWe got her toaster, microwave, plates \u2014 which we brought back to New York because we love them so much,\u201d Weaver said. In that otherwise bare house, the two women \u2014 \u201cPeggy and I are an off-again-on-again couple,\u201d Weaver noted; their complicity during the joint interview was obvious \u2014 resumed work on \u201cLast Gasp,\u201d the new show they were meant to perform at New York\u2019s La MaMa in April and London\u2019s Barbican in June 2020. The dates ended up being canceled, like all dates, but \u201cLast Gasp WFH\u201d (for Working From Home) was created and recorded on Zoom. Weaver directed and the two women handled the sound and lighting themselves, with the help of a remote team that included technical designers and a choreographer. The resulting hybrid of theater, movement and video \u2014 Shaw, 76, called it a Zoom movie, or \u201cZoomie\u201d \u2014 is not just one of the 40-year-old company\u2019s best pieces, but among the most evocative art to emerge from the Covid era; it is streaming on the La MaMa website until Dec. 5. The title, which came early in the process, proved premonitory. \u201cWe were looking at the backdrop of climate change, the integration of our aging process, Peggy saying it was going to be her last show, the last gasp of democracy, maybe,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThen we found ourselves in a pandemic, where you couldn\u2019t breathe, and in a civil unrest that was symbolized by \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 \u201cAnd then we found ourselves in a house that was also in its last gasp,\u201d she added. \u201cWe had no idea these things would come together in that way when we named the show over a year ago.\u201d That is a lot to unpack, yet \u201cLast Gasp WFH\u201d is remarkably light on its feet. For starters, the 90-minute piece looks effortlessly striking because Weaver and Shaw position themselves perfectly within the frame, coming up with almost painterly compositions. \u201cWe have a spatial awareness that we obviously bring to our theater and performance,\u201d Weaver said, \u201cbut maybe being able to see ourselves in the frame had something to do with it.\u201d The fleet, surprisingly entertaining movie is alternately playful, surreal, pointed and poignant, and its nonlinear scenes incorporate many of Split Britches\u2019 calling cards: autobiography, sly humor, pop-culture references (Bill Withers to Beyonc\u00e9) and questioning of gender. This makes Weaver\u2019s matter-of-fact mention that the project would be Shaw\u2019s last performance all the more bittersweet. Shaw has long been a singular presence on the American theater scene, a butch lesbian who has regularly explored her identity in such pieces as \u201cMenopausal Gentleman.\u201d Then again, \u201cPeggy has said this is her last show since we started working together 40 years ago,\u201d Weaver said, laughing. \u201cThis is her coping mechanism.\u201d Yes, but what if she really means it now? \u201cFor whatever reason, if it\u2019s the last one, I feel really happy that it exists in this form and that it\u2019s manifested itself in this way,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI feel really pleased with the way it is.\u201d Shaw, who was just off-camera, piped in: \u201cWe\u2019ll make another movie.\u201d (She and Weaver were calling from their Catskills house; they also each have a studio in Manhattan\u2019s East Village.) \u201cPeggy, you can come and sit here,\u201d Weaver reminded her, before reorienting the laptop so Shaw could be onscreen. \u201cI knew this was going to happen,\u201d she added dryly, clearly aware her charismatic, witty accomplice would not be able to remain quiet for long. Shaw, who had a stroke in 2011 (a setback she explored in the solo show \u201cRuff\u201d), can\u2019t memorize lines anymore. In \u201cLast Gasp WFH,\u201d she wears big headphones to listen to the words Weaver feeds her during monologues. There is no attempt to hide what\u2019s going on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fit little headphones into my ears because I already have hearing aids,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cJohnnie Ray had a big hearing aid in the 1950s in order to perform,\u201d she continued, referring to a partially deaf singer whom she name-checks in the piece. \u201cThe other thing is, that was the only pair of headphones we had. Like, we just wore black [in the movie] because we didn\u2019t have anything with us from the show, except the yellow slicker and the yellow boots, in case it rained or something.\u201d In scenes they shared, Weaver couldn\u2019t also be reading out Shaw\u2019s lines. So they scrawled them on paper and taped the pages to a wall. \u201cWe were trying to act a scene we adapted from \u2018Marriage Story,\u2019\u201d Weaver said, alluding to the Noah Baumbach film about a divorcing couple. \u201cIt\u2019s such an iconic fight between two people, and the subject was the same one that we have: We have had affairs and fights about it. We have conflicts over the fact that Peggy gets awards and I don\u2019t, even though we work together.\u201d In many ways, \u201cLast Gasp WFH\u201d feels like a culmination for Split Britches \u2014 even though it\u2019s not in the company\u2019s usual medium. \u201cWe know and trust our methods now,\u201d Weaver explained. \u201cAnd in this case, we had the opportunity to fine-tune them in ways that we don\u2019t often get to fine-tune them on the stage. I don\u2019t think we know how to do anything else.\u201d Last Gasp WFHAvailable on demand through Dec. 12; lamama.org",

    "article_text": "Prisons Are Covid-19 Hotbeds. When Should Inmates Get the Vaccine? They live in crowded conditions, sharing bathrooms and eating facilities where social distancing is impossible. They have high rates of asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Many struggle with mental illness. A disproportionate number are Black and Hispanic, members of minority communities that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. So should prisoners and other detainees be given priority access to one of the new Covid-19 vaccines? With distribution expected to start as early as this month, public health officials are scrambling to develop guidelines for the equitable allocation of limited vaccine supplies. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Tuesday to make initial determinations about who gets the first shots. There is broad consensus that health care workers who treat Covid-19 patients should be first in line. Other high-priority groups include residents and employees of long-term care facilities, essential workers whose jobs keep people fed and society running, and medically vulnerable and older adults \u2014 roughly in that order. Prison inmates are not ranked in the top tiers of the federal criteria, even though some of the largest outbreaks have occurred in the nation\u2019s prisons. More than 2,200 inmates were sickened and 28 people died, for example, after an outbreak in the San Quentin State Prison in California over the summer. Yet the C.D.C. advisory committee has prioritized correctional officers and others who work in jails and prisons for the first phase of immunizations. The federal prison system will set aside its initial allotment for such employees, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. The discrepancy raises a chilling prospect: another prison outbreak that kills scores of inmates after the only preventive was reserved for staff. Officials at the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Now several groups, including the American Medical Association, are calling for coronavirus vaccines to be given to inmates and employees at prisons, jails and detention centers, citing the unique risks to people in confinement \u2014 and the potential for outbreaks to spread from correctional centers, straining community hospitals. \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying that prisoners should be treated any better than anybody else, but they shouldn\u2019t be treated any worse than anybody else who is forced to live in a congregate setting,\u201d said Dr. Eric Toner, co-author of a report on vaccine allocation published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The report lists prisoners as a priority group, Dr. Toner said, though not \u201cat the very tiptop, but at the next tier down.\u201d Some states, in their own distribution plans, already are moving in that direction. North Carolina, for example, plans to give first priority to health care providers, but also includes people at high risk for severe disease and high risk for exposure to the virus.  That list includes people in congregate living settings, such as migrant farm camps, jails and prisons, and homeless shelters, along with other \u201chistorically marginalized\u201d populations. Allocating precious medical resources to people who are serving time may be anathema to much of the public, but it is widely accepted that the nation has an ethical and legal obligation to safeguard the health of incarcerated individuals. There is also a powerful public health argument to be made for prison vaccination: Outbreaks that start in prisons and jails may spread to the surrounding community. \u201cPrisons are incubators of infectious disease,\u201d Dr. Toner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental tenet of public health to try and stop epidemics at their source,\u201d he added. One approach, under consideration by the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice, would be to prioritize vaccination only for prisoners and detainees whose medical conditions or advanced age put them at great risk should they become ill. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a criminal justice recommendation,\u201d said Khalil Cumberbatch, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan group focused on criminal justice policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health recommendation. The virus is not in a vacuum if it\u2019s in a state prison.\u201d The United States holds some 2.3 million individuals in prisons, jails and other detention centers, incarcerating more people per capita than any other nation. That includes nearly 500,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting trials, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. (Some jails have taken steps to reduce overcrowding since the pandemic started.) Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The figure also includes some 44,000 youngsters who are held in juvenile facilities and an estimated 42,000 in immigration detention centers. People held in confinement are uniquely vulnerable to the virus. Incarcerated individuals are four times more likely to become infected than people in the general population, according to a study by the criminal justice commission. Over all, Covid-19 mortality rates among prisoners are higher than in the general population. So far, at least 200,000 inmates have already been infected with Covid-19, and at least 1,450 inmates and correctional officers have died from the virus, according to a database maintained by The New York Times. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Those numbers most likely underestimate the magnitude of the problem, because reporting requirements are spotty and vary from state to state, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and another co-author of the vaccine allocation report. In Connecticut, doctors tested over 10,000 prisoners in state prisons and jails from March to June and found that 13 percent were infected with the coronavirus, according to research published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Inmates who lived in dormitory housing were at the highest risk. Older inmates and Latino inmates also were more likely than others to be infected. Even before the pandemic, many older inmates had poor health after decades of \u201chard living,\u201d said Dr. Charles Lee, president-elect of the American College of Correctional Physicians. \u201cFrom my experience, their physiological age is generally 20 years greater than their chronologic age \u2014 from drugs, from fights, from being incarcerated and homeless, and not getting health care,\u201d Dr. Lee said. Up to 40 percent of incarcerated adults are Black, Dr. Lee said, a group with higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Many argue that regardless of public health considerations, society has both legal and ethical responsibilities to protect the health of inmates. \u201cThere are truly bad guys in prison, but the vast majority of people in prisons and jails are not what the media makes us think about \u2014 they are not mass murderers,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. \u201cMany people are about to get released soon. Many are in for petty crimes.\u201d \u201cThe ethical obligation is to protect the lives of prisoners, not just see them as sources of disease,\u201d Mr. Caplan added.",

    "article_text": "Dr. Atlas, Trump\u2019s coronavirus adviser, resigns. Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused disputed theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Trump on the pandemic, has resigned his White House position, according to a senior government official. The move was not entirely unexpected. Dr. Atlas caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with his frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel over the summer, and joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term that was set to expire this week. Fox News first reported his resignation, which Dr. Atlas later announced on Twitter. \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus \u2014 to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Atlas wrote in a letter obtained by Fox, adding that he \u201calways relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d But some of Dr. Atlas\u2019s administration colleagues would likely differ with that assessment, citing views that differ starkly from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government scientists. Dr. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot pass on the coronavirus. Even more controversial was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Dr. Atlas\u2019s view, the government\u2019s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as Covid-19 takes its course. His argument was that most people infected with the virus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people will have antibodies from Covid-19 to deprive the virus of carriers \u2014 \u201cherd immunity.\u201d Public health experts were appalled, and Dr. Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes. I just do, period,\u201d Dr. Fauci said earlier this month on the NBC program \u201cToday.\u201d But Dr. Atlas had the ear of one person who mattered: Mr. Trump.",

    "article_text": "The Long Darkness Before Dawn Each week, good news about vaccines or antibody treatments surfaces, offering hope that an end to the pandemic is at hand. And yet this holiday season presents a grim reckoning. The United States has reached an appalling milestone: more than one million new coronavirus cases every week. Hospitals in some states are full to bursting. The number of deaths is rising and seems on track to easily surpass the 2,200-a-day average in the spring, when the pandemic was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. Our failure to protect ourselves has caught up to us. The nation now must endure a critical period of transition, one that threatens to last far too long, as we set aside justifiable optimism about next spring and confront the dark winter ahead. Some epidemiologists predict that the death toll by March could be close to twice the 250,000 figure that the nation surpassed only last week. \u201cThe next three months are going to be just horrible,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health and one of two dozen experts interviewed by The New York Times about the near future. This juncture, perhaps more than any to date, exposes the deep political divisions that have allowed the pandemic to take root and bloom, and that will determine the depth of the winter ahead. Even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to avoid holiday travel and many health officials asked families to cancel big gatherings, more than six million Americans took flights during Thanksgiving week, which is about 40 percent of last year\u2019s air traffic. And President Trump, the one person most capable of altering the trajectory between now and spring, seems unwilling to help his successor do what must be done to save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has assembled excellent advisers and a sensible plan for tackling the pandemic, public health experts said. But Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AVAC, an AIDS advocacy group that focuses on several diseases, said Mr. Biden\u2019s hands appeared tied until Inauguration Day on Jan. 20: \u201cThere\u2019s not a ton of power in being president-elect.\u201d By late December, the first doses of vaccine may be available to Americans, federal officials have said. Priorities are still being set, but vaccinations are expected to go first to health care workers, nursing home residents and others at highest risk. How long it will take to reach younger Americans depends on many factors, including how many vaccines are approved and how fast they can be made. In mid-October, I surprised some New York Times readers by shifting from pessimism to optimism, with the epidemic in the United States most likely ending sooner than I expected. Now that at least two vaccines with efficacy greater than 90 percent have emerged, I am even more hopeful about what 2021 holds. But even as the medical response to the virus is improving, the politics of public health remain a deeply vexing challenge. The regions of the country now among those hit hardest by the virus \u2014 Midwestern and Mountain States and rural counties, including in the Dakotas, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming \u2014 are the ones that voted heavily for Mr. Trump in the recent election. The president could help save his millions of supporters by urging them to wear masks, avoid crowds and skip holiday gatherings this year. But that seemed unlikely to occur, many health experts said. \u201cThat is outside of his DNA,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University medical school. \u201cIt would mean admitting he was wrong and Tony Fauci was right.\u201d In a bitter paradox, some experts noted, Mr. Trump could have been the hero of this pandemic. Operation Warp Speed, which his administration announced in May, appears on track to deliver vaccines and therapies in record-breaking time. The United States may well become the first country to bring the virus to heel through pharmaceutical prowess. Had Mr. Trump heeded his medical advisers in late spring and adopted measures to curb new infections, the nation could now be on track to exit the epidemic next year with far fewer deaths per capita than many other nations. But during his campaign, Mr. Trump spent little time explaining the importance of Operation Warp Speed; it has invested more than $12 billion in six vaccines based on three complex new technologies, as well as antibody therapies with nearly unpronounceable names like bamlanivimab. Some health experts expressed concern that Mr. Trump might continue to undermine the coronavirus effort after he leaves office, by contradicting and diminishing any measure proposed by Mr. Biden. \u201cThe thinking over here,\u201d said Dr. David L. Heymann, a former C.D.C. official who now oversees the Center on Global Health Security at Chatham House in London, \u201cis that he will continue to harass the White House to mobilize his people for 2024 for himself or his daughter or sons.\u201d The antidote to hopelessness is agency, and Americans can protect themselves even without Mr. Trump\u2019s advice by wearing masks and keeping their distance from others. Reluctant officials are finally coming around to ordering such measures. The governors of Iowa and New Hampshire issued mask mandates for the first time in mid-November; the governors of Kansas, North Carolina and Hawaii strengthened theirs. But average Americans are sharply divided over masks. \u201cThere is pretty broad support for mask mandates even among Republicans,\u201d said Martha Louise Lincoln, a medical historian at San Francisco State University. \u201cBut among extreme right-wing voters there\u2019s still a perception that they\u2019re a sign of weakness or a symbol of being duped.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines on Nov. 10, advocating more clearly than before that everyone, infected or healthy, should wear a mask. Various studies, involving machines puffing fine mists, have shown that high-quality masks can significantly reduce the spread of pathogens between people in conversation. And the common-sense evidence that masks work has become overwhelming. Dozens of \u201csuperspreader events\u201d have taken place in venues where most people were not masked \u2014 in bars and restaurants, at summer camps, at funerals, on airplanes, in churches, at choir practice. In contrast, none have been known to occur in venues where most people wore masks, such as grocery stores. One well-known C.D.C. study showed that, even in a Springfield, Mo., hair salon where two stylists were infected, not one of the 139 customers whose hair they cut over the course of 10 days caught the disease. A city health order had required that both the stylists and the customers be masked. Even in the most dangerous environments \u2014 hospital emergency rooms \u2014 there have been no reported superspreader events since personal protective gear became widely available. (Many individual doctors and nurses have been infected, however; an incident in South Bend, Ind., in which multiple nurses were infected turned out to be related to a wedding.) By contrast, the White House, where masks have been shunned, has been the scene of at least one, and possibly more superspreader events. A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimated that 130,000 lives could be saved by February if mask use became universal in the United States immediately. Masks can also preserve the economy: A study by Goldman Sachs estimated that universal use would save $1 trillion that may be lost to business shutdowns and medical bills. Mr. Biden has said that he intends to tackle the pandemic from his first full day in office, on Jan. 21. But because coronavirus deaths follow new cases by some weeks, any results of his actions may not be apparent before early spring. The experts generally praised the panel of advisers chosen by Mr. Biden, depicting them as reputable scientists who could credibly reach out to many groups hard-hit by the pandemic, including Black and Hispanic Americans. But several experts, some of whom spoke anonymously to avoid offending friends and colleagues, said the panel needed different skills and a different kind of balance. Some felt that it should have more scientific expertise, and suggested recruiting more vaccinologists, such as Dr. Paul A. Offit of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and more epidemiologists, such as Harvard\u2019s Marc Lipsitch and Natalie E. Dean of the University of Florida. Others said the panel needed more behavioral scientists adept at fighting rumors, which have been a major obstacle. \u201cWe\u2019re facing extremely complex and poorly understood dynamics around disinformation, conspiratorial theories, paranoia and mistrust,\u201d Dr. Lincoln noted. Among the suggested names with those skills were Heidi J. Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project in London, Carl T. Bergstrom of the University of Washington and Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina. Others said the panel had too many members tied to the Obama-Biden administration. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, for example, was an architect of the Affordable Care Act and Dr. Eric Goosby was Mr. Obama\u2019s global AIDS coordinator. To reach Mr. Trump\u2019s base, they said, the panel needs credible Republican experts. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, \u201cthere will be even more of a mistaken perception that this is Democrats and doctors trying to shut down the economy, when actually controlling the virus is key to economic recovery.\u201d Experts suggested adding Dr. Bill Frist, a transplant surgeon and former Republican senator, or Dr. Marc K. Siegel, an internist and Fox News opinion writer. Mr. Warren suggested consulting marketing experts and recruiting \u201ceveryone from Santa Claus to LeBron James\u201d as trusted spokesmen. Another expert suggested adding Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, a heart surgeon and television personality who was criticized for promoting hydroxychloroquine on Fox News (he later relented), and possibly even asking Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to join, because they are popular with Mr. Trump\u2019s base and might be persuaded to accept science that would save the lives of their own viewers. Mr. Biden\u2019s plan for tackling the pandemic is outlined on his website. It calls for far more widespread testing, delivered free; a ban on out-of-pocket costs for medical care for the virus; having the military build temporary hospitals if necessary; cooperation with American businesses to create more personal protective gear and ventilators; more food relief for the poor, and other measures. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Mr. Biden has said he supports a national mask mandate, although his plan calls on governors to impose state ones. All the experts interviewed by The Times praised the plan, but several felt it was not aggressive enough. The pandemic is raging so far beyond control, they argued, that it can be contained only with deeply unpopular but necessary measures, such as rigorously enforced mask laws, closing bars and restaurants, requiring regular testing in schools and workplaces, isolating the infected away from their families, prohibiting travel from high-prevalence areas to low ones, and imposing quarantines that are enforced rather than merely requested. Many other countries have imposed such measures despite fierce opposition from some citizens, they said, and they have helped. \u201cColleges are the Wuhans of this fall surge,\u201d said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan\u2019s medical school. Universities, he and other experts said, must stop students from going back and forth between their hometowns and college towns, both of which have many vulnerable residents. The key to enforcing mask laws, noted Dr. Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, is to punish not people but the owners of buildings that ignore restrictions; Quebec, he noted, fines stores $4,500 if customers are unmasked. But after a very divisive election, other experts said, it will be hard to get many Americans to cooperate, especially if Mr. Trump encourages resistance. Also, there are legal limits on what the federal government can do. American \u201csanitary codes\u201d and quarantine laws are overwhelmingly based on state and local powers, many of which were granted in the 19th century, when epidemics constantly swept the nation\u2019s cities. The federal government\u2019s powers generally extend to interstate matters. So, for instance, while the Biden administration could easily make it a federal crime to refuse to wear a mask on a cross-country flight \u2014 or put offenders on the \u201cno fly list\u201d that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center \u2014 it probably cannot make every resident of South Dakota wear a mask if Gov. Kristi Noem and the State Legislature oppose the measure. Ms. Noem has said that she will not enforce mask mandates or lockdowns even if Mr. Biden, as president, orders them. The health experts interviewed by The Times all expressed excitement that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were reported to be 95 percent effective with no serious safety problems. On Nov. 23, a third vaccine, from AstraZeneca, also appeared to be effective, although exactly how effective is disputed. \u201cThis is an amazing feat of science we\u2019ve just seen, to go from a gene sequence on Jan. 10 to a vaccine by Nov. 10,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence Corey, who is harmonizing disparate vaccine trials so their results can be easily compared. However, experts still want to read the data, not just what Dr. Offit called \u201cscience by news release.\u201d (Pharmaceutical companies often wait until they have publishable data before announcing clinical trial results. But when news is likely to jolt a stock\u2019s price, it is released immediately to reduce the chance of anyone connected to the company engaging in insider trading, or even appearing to.) Mr. Biden will inherit the fruits of Operation Warp Speed and oversee their distribution. Members of his transition team, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to reveal its deliberations, said they were already discussing two sensitive topics: whether to create a secure way for vaccinated individuals to prove they have received both shots, and whether Covid vaccines should ultimately be made mandatory \u2014 either by the federal government, or by state governments, employers, school systems or the like. Making vaccines mandatory may be a political struggle, but it is within the scope of American law. In 1905, in a landmark case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state government to make smallpox vaccination mandatory, on the grounds that it protected the public health \u2014 despite the fact that the crude smallpox vaccines of that era could cause severe side effects in some people. It is also within American religious tradition. Virtually every major religion has held that vaccines are permitted, and some even hold that their members are obliged to be vaccinated for the common good. Some experts not on the committee were adamant that, once Covid vaccines are proven to be both effective and safe, they should be made obligatory. Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, noted that his institution already has mandatory testing for all students and staff. He said that companies he advises would like to eventually make vaccination mandatory for all employees, but would prefer the government took the lead by requiring them. At Dr. Offit\u2019s pediatric hospital, every member must have had all routine vaccines and get an annual flu shot \u2014 or face dismissal. \u201cIt\u2019s not optional,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking care of children. And yes, down the line, I think vaccination will have to be mandatory. It\u2019s your responsibility as a citizen.\u201d The next dozen weeks will be long and painful. But spring is likely to bring highly effective vaccines and a renewed commitment to medical leadership, something that has been missing under Mr. Trump. \u201cThe C.D.C. will have to be rebuilt, and its guidelines and the F.D.A.\u2019s have to be promptly re-evaluated,\u201d said Dr. Robert L. Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University\u2019s medical school. \u201cThe Biden team will move quickly. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

    "article_text": "A Dose of Optimism, as the Pandemic Rages On On March 16, back when White House news conferences were still deemed safe to attend, President Trump stood before reporters and announced that drastic nationwide restrictions \u2014 in schools, work places, our social lives \u2014 were needed to halt the coronavirus. The guidelines, \u201c15 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d were accompanied by a grim chart. Based on a prominent model by London\u2019s Imperial College, the chart illustrated with a sinuous blue line how many Americans might die if nothing were done to protect the public\u2019s health. The line rose sharply as the estimated deaths went up, then drifted slowly down until finally, at the far right end of the graph, the number of new cases reached zero. Our national nightmare would end by October 2020 \u2014 that is, right about now. Along the way, if no action was taken, about 2.2 million Americans would die. Dr. Deborah Birx, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s science advisers, referred to the graph as \u201cthe blue mountain of deaths.\u201d Clearly, the pandemic has not ended. So far some 215,000 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus, and reliable estimates suggest that the number could reach 400,000. Health experts agree that, with stronger leadership, the death toll would have been far lower. Nonetheless, there is a collective accomplishment here worth acknowledging. In the Imperial College report, the authors underscored that their worst-case estimate would almost certainly not be realized, thanks to human nature: \u201cIt is highly likely that there would be significant spontaneous changes in population behavior even in the absence of government-mandated interventions.\u201d That prediction proved true, as millions of Americans agreed, however reluctantly, to accept the sacrifices involved in shutting down parts of the economy, keeping distance from one other and wearing masks. In the day-to-day fights over reopening schools or bars, it is easy to forget that there was a time when the idea of canceling large public gatherings \u2014 the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s March Madness basketball tournament \u2014 did not seem remotely necessary. That there was a time when leading health officials said that only sick people and hospital workers needed to wear masks. Today, and despite the president\u2019s own resistance, masks are widely accepted. Various polls show that the number of Americans who wear them, at least when entering stores, went from near zero in March to about 65 percent in early summer to 85 percent or even 90 percent in October. Seeing the president and many White House staffers stricken by the virus may convince yet more Americans to wear masks. The slow but relentless acceptance of what epidemiologists call \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d has made a huge difference in lives saved. The next step is pharmaceutical interventions. Some are already modestly successful, such as the antiviral drug remdesivir and steroids like dexamethasone. But in the near distance are what Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist, has called \u201cthe cavalry\u201d \u2014 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. They are likely to be far more effective. Since January, when I began covering the pandemic, I have been a consistently gloomy Cassandra, reporting on the catastrophe that experts saw coming: that the virus would go pandemic, that Americans were likely to die in large numbers, the national lockdown would last well beyond Easter and even past summer. No miracle cure was on the horizon; the record for developing a vaccine was four years. Events have moved faster than I thought possible. I have become cautiously optimistic. Experts are saying, with genuine confidence, that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected, possibly by the middle of next year. That is still some time off. Experts warn that this autumn and winter may be grim; indoor dining, in-classroom schooling, contact sports, jet travel and family holiday dinners may all drive up infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Cases are rising in most states, and some hospitals already face being overwhelmed. Even if the cavalry is in sight, it is not here yet. To prevent deaths reaching 400,000, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci has warned, \u201cWe all need to hunker down.\u201d The final death toll from Covid-19 will depend both on how we behave going forward and how quickly innovations arrive. Already the United States is faring much better than it did during the Spanish influenza \u2014 the worst pandemic to hit the country to date, and the one to which this one is often compared. It began in early 1918 and did not completely fade away until 1920, when herd immunity arrived, at the cost of 675,000 lives. The country\u2019s population at the time was 103 million, so that toll is equivalent to 2 million dead today. Pandemics don\u2019t end abruptly; they decelerate gradually, like supertankers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that about 10 percent of the American population has been infected. As that figure grows, and as people begin to get shots after a vaccine is approved, transmission should slow. Every Covid survivor and every vaccine recipient will be a broken link in the chains of transmission. There have been rare cases of people becoming infected twice; this happens even with chickenpox. But scientists assume that almost everyone who recovers from Covid cannot get or transmit the virus, at least for many months. Even by spring, we will not be entirely safe, but we probably will be safer. In the interim, as the pandemic runs its course, the percentage of infected people who die from the virus has been falling. The reasons are many. The average age of each new person infected is almost 30 years lower than it was in March. Fraternity brothers may be reckless, but few older Americans are. Nursing homes have become better at protecting their wards. The death rate per nursing home resident in states that were hit by the virus in late summer is about one-quarter the rate in the northeastern and southern states that were hit first. Simple interventions like pulse oximeters are detecting pneumonia before it becomes life-threatening. Steroids like dexamethasone have lowered the number of deaths among hospitalized patients by about one-third. Rolling patients onto their stomachs and delaying ventilator use also helps. Each lesson learned saves lives. Another good omen: Although in the spring health experts were fearful that a bad winter flu season could send thousands of patients to hospitals, all competing for ventilators and medical attention, the possibility of a \u201ctwindemic\u201d of coronavirus and influenza now seems far less likely. Flu is \u201cseeded\u201d in the United States each year by travelers from the Southern Hemisphere after the winter there ends. But this year their flu season was almost nonexistent \u2014 because they were socially distancing and, in some countries, wearing masks. And in this country, flu shots became available earlier than usual; so many Americans are rushing to get inoculated that spot-shortages are developing. If flu does arrive, those shots and our masks should blunt it. Another intervention that might make a big difference is monoclonal antibodies. Two weeks ago, most Americans had no idea what they were. Now, President Trump is touting them as his \u201cmiracle cure\u201d and, whether or not he is ultimately cured, monoclonals are famous. That attention could speed up their clinical trials, which had been delayed. (Many patients declined to volunteer, preferring to not risk being given a placebo when instead they could receive convalescent plasma, which Mr. Trump was promoting in August.) But experts believe that the antibodies could prove far more effective than plasma. Last year, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, monoclonal antibody cocktails proved 90 percent effective at saving Ebola victims from death. But this approach has limitations. It is believed to work only if administered soon after infection, and monoclonal antibodies are hard to produce and expensive, at least at the moment. If the treatment becomes popular, demand will quickly outstrip supply, forcing health officials to make hard choices. Early testing in animals and humans suggests that a dose a fraction the size of the one Mr. Trump received can protect an uninfected person against the virus. If that finding holds up, the antibodies could be used like a fast-acting vaccine, lasting just a month or so but providing a crucial \u201cbridge\u201d to the arrival of the new vaccines. Such a treatment could protect people at highest risk, such as health workers and nursing home residents. Or, in a \u201cring vaccination\u201d strategy, antibodies could be given to the household contacts of known cases. Ring vaccination was how smallpox was defeated. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But the number of doses will initially be limited, and choosing to use antibodies for prophylaxis over treatment may be frowned upon by medical ethicists. Sometime in the next three months, health experts say, the F.D.A. is likely to begin granting approval to vaccines now in the works. Despite the chaos in day-to-day politics and the fighting over issues like masks and lockdowns, Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the government\u2019s agreement to subsidize vaccine companies\u2019 clinical trials and manufacturing costs \u2014 appears to have been working with remarkable efficiency. It has put more than $11 billion into seven vaccine candidates, and the F.D.A. has said it will approve any one that is at least 50 percent effective at preventing infection or reducing its severity. Moncef Slaoui, Operation Warp Speed\u2019s chief scientific adviser and a former pharmaceutical executive who has overseen the development of 14 vaccines, has said repeatedly that he expects some of the candidates that he picked to have 75 to 90 percent efficacy and at least two to win approval by early January. By then, Dr. Slaoui has estimated, the factories under contract will have produced enough vaccine for 30 to 40 million people, and then another 80 to 90 million people every month after that. Assuming nothing goes wrong, he said, there will be enough doses for all 330 million Americans to be vaccinated by next June. Bill Gates, who is not part of Operation Warp Speed but works with it to develop vaccines for the world\u2019s poor, has agreed with that timetable. There will inevitably be distribution problems, but the military is standing by to help. The chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed is General Gustave F. Perna, a logistics specialist. Some health officials fear that when a vaccine arrives, many Americans will be reluctant to take it. Indeed, about half of Americans have told pollsters that they feel this way. Nonetheless, I believe that hesitancy may dissipate, if no major safety problems emerge as the first few million Americans are inoculated. The last time the nation faced a moment like this was in the 1950s, when polio vaccine became available. For years, parents had lived in fear of the virus, as they saw children die, living in iron lungs or walking with braces on withered legs. When the Salk vaccine became available in 1955 \u2014 and again in the 1960s when it was replaced by the Sabin vaccine \u2014 Americans lined up in droves to receive it. The demand for polio vaccine survived even the horrifying Cutter Incident of 1955, in which a bad batch of 200,000 Salk doses from Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, Calif. partially paralyzed 260 children and killed 10. I have seen a similar trend as I covered the polio eradication drives in Pakistan and Nigeria. When a disease is actually tearing through a population, vaccine hesitation collapses. Even in the face of persistent rumors that polio vaccines would make their daughters sterile, mothers in Pakistan who had seen other children crippled defied their husbands and imams and sneaked their own children off to be vaccinated. Even in the most resistant areas, such as those controlled by the Pakistani Taliban or Boko Haram, vaccination campaigns attracted parents by setting up \u201chealth camps\u201d that offered a dozen vaccines, polio just one among them. No vaccine is 100 percent safe. \u201cThe most effective one may have the greatest risk if it stimulates the immune system enough to create the risk of autoimmune disease,\u201d said Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, an immunologist and founder of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. \u201cThere will be some risk-benefit calculations to make.\u201d But the alternative to being vaccinated is to risk a nearly 1 in 100 chance of death, as well as unquantifiable but still worrying threats of heart disease, lung damage and even brain damage. Not to mention the prospect of being unable to return to work, having to home-school one\u2019s children for years and not eating in a restaurant, flying on an airplane or watching a movie in a theater without the specter of anxiety. Those are strong motivations to take a chance on a vaccine, especially if one\u2019s friends and relatives have had it and fared well. In September, the actress Jennifer Garner conducted an entertaining interview with Dr. Fauci on her Instagram feed, during which she asked when it would be safe to attend live theater again. \u201cThe end of 2021 or maybe even the middle of 2021,\u201d he replied. By then, he explained later, so many Americans would be vaccinated \u2014 or immune by virtue of having survived an infection \u2014 that it would be safe to sit unmasked in a crowded theater. Until then, masks and caution are our best alternative. If we rigorously protect ourselves and each other, we can starve the virus of new hosts until our national epidemic finally evaporates. Then we must help other countries get vaccines too; until they are protected, we cannot venture beyond our borders as tourists or business travelers, nor can others come here. No country can be forgotten; charitable motives aside, their tourists fill our hotels. We will have competition \u2014 or help, if we take a generous view of a global effort. China claims to already have five vaccines in phase 3 trials, and Russia is already marketing its vaccine abroad, although it has not even conducted a phase 3 trial. Many economists think our national recovery will be rapid, like those that followed the first and second world wars, rather than what followed the financial crashes of 1929 and 2008. China, having beaten the virus, has a growing economy again. Among Americans who have not lost their jobs, personal savings are at record levels. Despite loan defaults in this recession, banks are flush with cash and, if need be, can borrow from their thriving Asian counterparts. When the moment is safe, loans to revive restaurants, hotels and other small businesses should flow. In the interim, as we hunker down, Congress must find ways to ensure that millions of Americans who are out of work do not go hungry or get evicted. And once the pandemic is over, one more mission lies ahead: to make sure this does not happen again. We must search for the viruses in nature that are most likely to infect us, and spend the billions of dollars necessary to create vaccines and designer antibodies against them. So that next time we are ready.",

    "first_p": "Warning that New York had entered a \u201cnew phase in the war against Covid,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that the state will implement a barrage of new emergency actions, some of which echo the strict measures taken this spring, to stem a rising tide of infections and deaths.",
    "article_text": "Cuomo Fears \u2018Nightmare of Overwhelmed Hospitals\u2019 as Virus Cases Spike Warning that New York had entered a \u201cnew phase in the war against Covid,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that the state will implement a barrage of new emergency actions, some of which echo the strict measures taken this spring, to stem a rising tide of infections and deaths. Mr. Cuomo said that the strength of the virus\u2019s second wave has forced the state to rely less on test positivity rates as the determinant for restrictions, and focus more on hospital capacity. On Monday, the governor announced that hospitalizations topped 3,500 over the weekend, a level not seen since May. The governor said if hospitals become overwhelmed, he could impose a regionally based shutdown, or \u201cpause\u201d order, as he did statewide in the spring. He also asked hospitals to begin identifying retired doctors and nurses to help staff medical facilities, where he said burnout was an increasingly common problem. The governor said he wanted to prevent the conditions that led to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens being inundated by coronavirus patients this spring, with beds filled, doctors overworked and refrigerated trucks posted outside to hold the dead. \u201cWe are not going to live through the nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals again,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said during a briefing in Manhattan. Mr. Cuomo said that he would ask hospitals to increase the number of beds by 50 percent, and hospital chains to evaluate where there was capacity inside of those systems, to help redistribute patients where there was availability. Plans for field hospitals were being dusted off, the governor said, adding that capacity would also be evaluated between hospitals in different parts of the state, an idea known as \u201csurge-and-flex,\u201d another measure the governor implemented in the spring. Similarly, Mr. Cuomo also announced that he was ordering hospitals to stop elective surgery in Erie County, in Western New York, which is currently enduring the highest weekly positive test rates in the state. The county led the state in number of deaths reported on Monday. Despite rising rates of infection, Mr. Cuomo has resisted implementing the kind of widespread shutdowns seen in March, when hundreds of New Yorkers began to die every week, and much of New York\u2019s economic activity ground to a complete halt.  Rather, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strategy has been to utilize targeted restrictions on individual areas \u2014 known as his \u201cmicro-cluster initiative\u201d \u2014 which has now expanded to nearly 30 locations around the state, including in all five boroughs of New York City, its suburban counties, and major upstate population centers. The announcement on Monday came after weeks of steadily more worrying news in New York. The state\u2019s daily rate of positive tests on Sunday topped 4 percent for the first time since May, and the number of more serious cases continued to grow. The positivity rate was reported to be 4.57 percent on Monday. The death toll has also started to rise again: On Monday, the governor said 54 deaths were reported by the state. All told, almost 1,000 people died in New York this month, according to The New York Times\u2019s tally, making November the deadliest month since June. The state has suffered more than 34,000 deaths since the discovery of the first case in March 1, the most of any state. In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Cuomo noted that the current surge of cases has been more widespread than in the spring, when cases and deaths were largely concentrated in New York City and its suburbs. He recalled how some upstate regions sent reinforcements and resources to downstate medical facilities in the spring, and suggested that would be difficult now. \u201cEvery region is dealing with a hospital issue,\u201d he said. Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has been touting the state\u2019s response to the crisis for months, releasing a book in October about \u201cleadership lessons\u201d drawn from his experiences. The governor has also repeatedly made a point of saying that New York is doing well in comparison with other states. On Sunday, however, the governor seemed to modify his thinking on that point somewhat, saying, while \u201cit\u2019s nice that we\u2019re doing better in a national context,\u201d it is also \u201cirrelevant.\u201d \u201cBecause we have to deal with the issues that we have here in New York relative to New York, right?\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Cuomo praised efforts by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who appeared at the news conference via Zoom, to reopen elementary schools, while voicing broader support for plans to keep students in kindergarten through eighth grade in classrooms. The city will no longer use a 3 percent test positivity threshold that it had adopted for closing the school system; instead, the city will increase testing in schools and close those that have multiple confirmed virus cases. And with the state\u2019s daily positivity rate now above 4 percent, Mr. Cuomo \u2014 seemingly aware of how relying solely on rising infection rates could lead to economically detrimental shutdowns \u2014 had been indicating that a statewide shift in strategy was coming. On Monday, the governor said new metrics \u2014 including hospitalization rates, death and case rates, and available hospital beds \u2014 would be used to determine lockdown levels under the \u201cmicro-cluster\u201d strategy, the state\u2019s color-coded restriction system. Mr. Cuomo said those new numbers will be set this week, after the state evaluates the effects of people congregating during last week\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen the hit from Thanksgiving,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the increase in cases \u201cwill be dramatic.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how the governor will reconcile positivity rates and hospital metrics to determine new restrictions, but state officials said homing in on hospitalizations was a useful way to determine the severity of the disease in any given location. There are areas in the state where the number of people testing positive has increased, for example, but hospitalizations have not, lessening the urgency for new restrictions there, officials said. With Mr. Cuomo ordering the redistribution of patients across hospitals, the state plans to track hospitalizations by a patient\u2019s home address, not only where the person is hospitalized, to better ascertain which parts of the state are driving hospital admissions. Officials said that the governor\u2019s renewed focus on hospital capacity, harkening back to the grim projections of overrun hospitals in the spring, is a deliberate tactic to underscore the severity of the situation and prompt citizens to behave responsibly. Indeed, Mr. Cuomo predicted that the rates of infection would continue to rise through December and into January, while still expressing confidence that the state could withstand the second wave. State officials believe a majority of new cases in the state stem from small gatherings in homes, with people increasingly congregating indoors as temperatures drop, rather than in public settings like bars and restaurants. Changing that behavior, the governor said, would require a robust public messaging campaign similar to the one employed around mask wearing. \u201cIt is all in our control,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.

    "article_text": "Oregon Nurse Is Placed on Leave Over TikTok Video Mocking Masks A nurse in Oregon who mocked the state\u2019s pandemic protocols in a video that circulated on TikTok by saying she does not wear a mask in public has been placed on administrative leave, her employer said. The nurse, Ashley Grames, is an employee at Salem Health, which operates Salem Health Hospital in Salem, Ore., and other medical facilities treating Covid-19 patients in the state. Oregon has had at least 74,120 cases and 907 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a New York Times database. Salem Health said in a statement that members of the public had alerted the company to the video, which it said showed \u201ccavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic.\u201d Local media reports said that Ms. Grames, who worked in the oncology unit, had posted the video from a TikTok account that has since been deleted and that the video was later republished in a \u201cduet\u201d version on the platform. The video shows her wearing scrubs and a stethoscope around her neck, with a caption saying that she does not wear a mask in public, arranges play dates for her children and still travels. Ms. Grames could not be reached on Monday. KPTV reported that she declined to be interviewed when a reporter went to her home. \u201cYesterday, a nurse employed with Salem Health posted a video on social media which displayed cavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic and her indifference towards physical distancing and masking outside of work,\u201d Salem Health said in its statement, which it posted on Facebook on Saturday. \u201cThis video has prompted an outcry from concerned community members,\u201d the health system said. \u201cWe want to thank those of you who brought this to our attention and assure you that we are taking this very seriously. This individual does not speak for Salem Health and has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\u201d The health system\u2019s statement did not identify the nurse, but Michael T. Gay, a spokesman, provided her name on Monday and said she worked in the oncology department. The health system\u2019s Facebook post has attracted more than 1,000 comments, including from people who said they had relatives in the hospital. Some called for the nurse to be fired, while others questioned the difference between state mandates in private and public spaces. \u201cIs there a law in Oregon that medical professionals must wear a mask while being off the clock and off hospital grounds?\u201d one reader wrote, adding that the video was \u201cvery irresponsible and shows zero compassion for people who have experienced covid.\u201d Mr. Gay said that Salem Health expected its employees to follow the governor\u2019s orders when off duty. As officials have done in other states fighting the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon has imposed strict measures, with a two-week freeze on many activities from Nov. 18 through Dec. 2, and limiting gatherings to six people from no more than two households. Oregon also has a statewide mask mandate. Salem Health said in its statement that it required its staff members, patients and visitors to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those guidelines include hand washing, wearing masks that cover the mouth and nose when around others, and social distancing, all of which it has said are effective methods for slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Referring to the video, the company said that \u201cthis one careless statement does not reflect the position of Salem Health or the hardworking and dedicated caregivers who work here.\u201d \u201cThe Covid pandemic is serious and requires a serious response,\u201d the company added. \u201cAnd at Salem Health we are very serious about our approach to Covid.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Why Days 5 to 10 Are So Important When You Have Coronavirus When a relative of mine recently became seriously ill with what seemed to be a coronavirus infection, my first question was about timing. How many days ago did your symptoms start? Marking your calendar at the first sign of illness, and tracking your fever and oxygen levels, are important steps in monitoring a coronavirus infection. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has been unpredictable in the range of symptoms it can cause. But when it turns serious, it often follows a consistent pattern. While most patients recover in about a week, a significant minority of patients enter \u201ca very nasty second wave\u201d of illness, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta. \u201cAfter the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening.\u201d While every patient is different, doctors say that days five through 10 of the illness are often the most worrisome time for respiratory complications of Covid-19, particularly for older patients and those with underlying conditions like high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. Younger patients who develop complications may begin struggling a little later, as late as days 10 to 12. Most people who reach day 14 without any worrying symptoms (other than feeling miserable and fatigued) are likely to be on the road to recovery. \u201cWith any other disease, most people, after a week of symptoms, they\u2019re like \u2018OK, things will get better,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Leora Horwitz, associate professor of population health and medicine at N.Y.U. Langone Health. \u201cWith Covid, I tell people that around a week is when I want you to really pay attention to how you\u2019re feeling. Don\u2019t get complacent and feel like it\u2019s all over.\u201d It\u2019s important to call a doctor if you have shortness of breath or any concerning symptom no matter what day of illness you are on. And don\u2019t panic if you still feel lousy after a week of illness. It\u2019s common for Covid symptoms to linger, and feeling unwell for more than a week doesn\u2019t always mean you need medical treatment. But tracking symptoms and paying special attention as the illness nears its second week has taken on new urgency as more doctors are seeing patients arriving at the hospital with an insidious form of pneumonia. On scans, patients with Covid pneumonia have a finding called \u201cground-glass opacities,\u201d a hazy appearance in the lower part of both lungs. Oxygen levels may drop so slowly that the patient doesn\u2019t even notice, a condition called silent hypoxia. Often it is not until oxygen saturation reaches dangerously low levels, causing severe shortness of breath, that they finally seek care. The best way to monitor your health during this time is to use a pulse oximeter, a small device that clips on your finger and measures your blood oxygen levels. (There are phone-based apps meant to do this, but they have tested poorly) The normal oxygen saturation range is about 96 to 99 percent. If your blood oxygen reading drops to 92 percent, it\u2019s time to call a doctor. While at home, you can also increase the flow of oxygen to your lungs by not resting on your back. Resting on your stomach, in the prone position, can open parts of the lungs that are compressed when lying on your back. You can also change to resting on your left side or right side, or sit upright in a chair. Dr. Anna Marie Chang, an associate professor of emergency medicine and director of clinical research at Thomas Jefferson University, was sick for about a week before her oxygen levels dropped to 88 on the ninth day of her illness. She went to the hospital and was treated with oxygen and rested mostly in the prone position for four days to recover. It\u2019s not clear why relatively young, healthy patients like Dr. Chang, who is 38, sometimes take a turn for the worse. \u201cThe first part is viral illness and everything else,\u201d said Dr. Chang. \u201cYour body is developing your immune inflammatory response and trying to fight off infection. That system can get over stimulated, and that seems to be what causes the acute worsening. We\u2019re seeing that around days seven to 10.\u201d Dr. Chang cautioned that patients should listen to their bodies and not be too strict about following a timeline of symptoms. \u201cThe human body does not follow the perfect manual,\u201d she said. The problem, say doctors, is that the public health guidance so far has been to tell patients to ride out the illness at home and seek medical care or return only if they experience severe shortness of breath. As a result, too many patients are waiting too long to contact a doctor. \u201cFrom a public health perspective, we\u2019ve been wrong to tell people to come back only if they have severe shortness of breath,\u201d said Dr. Richard Levitan, a well-known emergency room doctor from New Hampshire who has called for widespread use of home pulse oximeters during the first two weeks of Covid-19 illness. \u201cToughing it out is not a great strategy.\u201d Dr. Levitan notes that while many patients may take a turn for the worse five to 10 days into the illness, he hesitates to be too specific about the timeline because not every patient is clear about exactly what day their illness began. \u201cPatients will sometimes define a time course of illness differently than what you would expect,\u201d Dr. Levitan said. \u201cWhen you ask someone how long have you been sick, I find a patient says a few days and his wife will say, no, he\u2019s been sick for a week.\u201d But what if you don\u2019t have a home pulse oximeter to monitor your health? The devices are now in short supply or can take weeks to be delivered. Some medical practices are sending their patients home kits that include pulse oximeters, so check with your doctor about how you might be monitored. Ask friends now if they have a pulse oximeter so you have a plan in place to borrow one for two weeks should you get sick (the device is easily sanitized). If you are still feeling lousy a week into your illness and don\u2019t have a pulse oximeter, you can also check in with an urgent care clinic and ask them to check your oxygen level. If you are concerned, talk to your doctor about whether a visit to an urgent care center or the emergency room is warranted. In the absence of a pulse oximeter, one rough measure of respiratory function is a self-test called the Roth score. It requires the patient to take a breath and try counting to 30. If a patient can\u2019t make it to the number 10 (or seven seconds) without another breath, it\u2019s likely their oxygen level has dropped below 95. If they can\u2019t count to the number 7 (or five seconds), their oxygen score may be below 90 percent. The test is not perfect, nor has it been studied in Covid-19. A University of Oxford team said the Roth score should not be used because it hasn\u2019t been validated and could give false reassurance. Another physical but subtle sign of falling oxygen: Patients may start taking short, fast breaths to compensate, although they may not notice they are doing it. Patients with low oxygen levels might also have a blue tinge to their lips or skin. That\u2019s why a video conference with your doctor can be helpful if you\u2019re not sure about whether you need to go to the hospital. Here\u2019s a look at the timeline of Covid symptoms. While this can serve as a general guide, symptoms can appear at any time. Always listen to your body and consult with a doctor for guidance about your specific case. Early symptoms of Covid-19 vary widely. It can start with a tickle in your throat, a cough, fever, headache and feeling winded or just a little pressure in your chest. Sometimes it begins with a bout of diarrhea. Some people just feel tired and lose their sense of taste and smell. Many people have several symptoms but no fever. Some patients with gastrointestinal symptoms go on to develop respiratory symptoms, while others don\u2019t. Some patients never develop more than mild symptoms, or none at all. Others begin to feel terrible, with an ever-present fever, aches, chills, cough and an inability to get comfortable. Some children and younger adults with mild disease may develop rashes, including itchy red patches, swelling or blistering on the toes or fingers, similar to frostbite. The exact timing isn\u2019t clear, and the symptom may appear early in the infection or after it has passed. That\u2019s what happened to Dr. Schwartz, who developed respiratory symptoms and then blisters on his feet. \u201cIt seems that a lot of these individuals, including myself, test negative\u201d on coronavirus swab tests, he said. \u201cI presume it\u2019s a false negative. It could be that what we\u2019re seeing is an immunological phenomenon that occurs after the initial infection is on the mend.\u201d For some lucky patients with mild illness, the worst is over after a week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that even if you feel better, you still should wait 10 days after symptoms started, and go 24 hours without a fever, before leaving isolation. But some patients who have felt terrible continue to feel terrible or get worse. And some patients might start to feel better briefly then take a turn for the worse. Patients should monitor their oxygen levels and check in with a doctor if they start to feel unwell. \u201cWe should instruct patients to have a lower threshold for contacting their doctor,\u201d Dr. Levitan said. \u201cI believe they should contact their physicians to have monitoring if they\u2019re feeling worse.\u201d Monitoring should continue for the second week of illness. Patients may feel better sleeping on their stomachs or sides. \u201cDays eight to 12 are when we have a really good idea if someone is going to get better or get worse,\u201d said Dr. Charles A. Powell, director of the Mount Sinai-National Jewish Health Respiratory Institute. \u201cThe major thing we worry about is a worsening at eight to 12 days \u2014 an increasing shortness of breath, worsening cough.\u201d Dr. Powell said a home oxygen monitor can signal if someone needs to come in. Otherwise, patients should talk to their doctors. \u201cIf it\u2019s difficult for the person at home to feel comfortable, and it\u2019s difficult for the family to feel things are manageable, that would lead a physician to suggest the patient come in for evaluation,\u201d said Dr. Powell. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait too long for blood oxygen levels to get worse.\u201d Patients who had mild illness should be well recovered. Patients who had worse symptoms but maintained normal oxygen levels should feel mostly recovered after two weeks, although many patients report lingering fatigue and other issues. Doctors advise a slow return to activity, even if you had mild or moderate illness. Patients with severe symptoms and those who needed additional treatment because of low oxygen may still feel unwell and fatigued and take far longer to recover.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to Homeownership Joe DeVito, like many other New Yorkers who wanted more space to weather the pandemic, headed north and bought a two-bedroom house in the Catskills in late July.  He learned almost immediately that there\u2019s no such thing as turnkey when it comes to owning property. First, the outdoor wood-burning furnace didn\u2019t provide enough heat for the 1,700-square-foot house, then the dishwasher needed replacing, then diseased trees needed to be cut down, the land needed leveling and he had to build a proper driveway.  It was a crash course in homeownership for Mr. DeVito, 46, a content and marketing executive for the New York Mets who still rents an apartment in Astoria but now spends most of his time in the Delaware County house he bought for $230,000. And now as the region settles into cooler weather, he and other recent first-time home buyers like him will have to learn how to grapple with unanticipated but seasonal home maintenance issues and costs. Does the house have or need storm windows? How much firewood will we need for the season? When and how do we clean the gutters? Should we have known that the boiler was on its last legs? How do you stop a house from being drafty? The lesson that every appliance and fixture has a limited shelf life and that maintenance costs add up quickly has already sunk in for Mr. DeVito, particularly because it seems the home\u2019s previous owners relied on D.I.Y. fixes around the house. He has also realized some stark differences between city and country life. \u201cWe are spoiled by a lot of the \u2018amenities\u2019 that the city and our buildings provide,\u201d like sanitation and snow removal, he said. And country living, he has discovered, is an exercise in patience. \u201cIt takes weeks to get someone to do appliance repair. Even Amazon packages take 10 days, not two days.\u201d He suspects this might be why previous owners frequently took repairs into their own hands. \u201cIf you hire someone for every little need, you\u2019ll go broke while waiting way too long for anything to get done,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst-year costs can be very high,\u201d explained Sarah Gerecke, a former deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Housing Counseling at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and now the principal at SSG Community Solutions, a housing and community development consultancy based in New York City. Ms. Gerecke warns buyers to apply caution as they rush to secure new homes, and to seriously reconsider any urge to skip home inspections or boost their offer without fully comprehending the significant costs of maintenance and upkeep. One option: HUD-certified housing counselors, who are specially trained to help consumers \u2014 especially low- and moderate-income families \u2014 grapple with the inevitable vicissitudes of homeownership. They assist homeowners in establishing feasible home budgets and plans for unexpected disasters, and by providing tutorials for simple home maintenance tasks. Pre-purchase counseling and education is more widely available, says Ms. Gerecke, who explained that most HUD counseling is available to anyone at no cost, though some education programs have a nominal fee.  For recent transplants interested in fostering a connection with their new community, an app like Nextdoor is one way to link up with locals to exchange information, goods and services. Stefany Elliott, a public relations professional, found the app invaluable for \u201cgetting to know our neighbors and the neighborhood in a pandemic.\u201d Ms. Elliott, 36, and her husband, Spencer Elliott, recently moved from a rental apartment in a doorman building in Manhattan\u2019s Gramercy Park to a three-bedroom house they bought for $465,000 in New Jersey\u2019s Lake Hopatcong community. The couple spent a few thousand dollars replacing a broken refrigerator and furnace oil pump, and updating their fireplace and chimney for the season. A smart video doorbell, which cost $300, was also purchased, to help them adjust to no longer having a doorman to greet visitors or accept packages. The app was most helpful for solving more day-to-day queries. Within weeks of moving in, the couple successfully crowdsourced questions about local events, veterinarians, solar panels, and where to get fresh cut flowers. Substantial traffic on similar apps like Sweeten, Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor (a brand affiliated with Angie\u2019s List), which connect home service professionals with homeowners and their projects, underscores the degree of competition for contractors and handymen nationwide. Customer demand for vetted contractors on Sweeten grew by 104 percent in the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same time last year. Thumbtack reported a jump of 138 percent year-over-year for appliance installation in the New York tristate area. \u201cOur professionals are busier now than ever before,\u201d said Mallory Micetich, a communications representative for HomeAdvisor, who says the industry is currently experiencing a labor shortage of available service professionals across all skill sets. Online, brands like Family Handyman and Better Homes & Gardens offer seasonal maintenance checklists with helpful prompts for gutter cleaning, servicing the furnace and sealing drafty windows. \u201cFirst-time home buyers don\u2019t think about or plan for important home emergencies,\u201d said Ms. Micetich, who revealed that the average cost of serious plumbing or weather-related emergencies is often around $1,200. This was a lesson that Daniel Glass, a lawyer, learned the hard way. In mid-July, Mr. Glass, along with his fianc\u00e9, Jordan Brodsky, left where they were temporarily staying on Long Island and closed on a two-bedroom house in Falls Village, Conn., in the town of Canaan in Litchfield County. They paid $550,000 for the property, which is on the Housatonic River. Shortly after they moved in, the air-conditioning stopped working. \u201cAfter being in apartments \u2014 and having a super to call for things \u2014 we were at a loss on how to find someone to investigate and make repairs as necessary,\u201d said Mr. Glass, 35. A technician discovered that a mouse had chewed through wires, which caused a coolant leak. After a week and $1,000 out of pocket, they had functioning air-conditioning again. Then, at the beginning of August, a brief but destructive tornado and hailstorm caused extensive damage to trees on their property and to part of their home. Power was out for two weeks, and damage from the storm cost several thousand dollars. While the house has a built-in propane-powered generator to run all electrical systems, it had to be switched off while workers were repairing the lines. \u201cIt proved useless for this situation,\u201d Mr. Glass said. He warns anyone transitioning from an apartment to a house to budget more and plan for the worst. \u201cLiving in a rural area became amplified \u2014 it was difficult finding certain services, like a roofer or contractor, especially without electricity or internet,\u201d Mr. Glass said, adding that the remote location meant fewer available options, and being new meant no support network they could yet rely on. Experts suggest being proactive in building a go-to list of home professionals like an electrician, landscaper and plumber. To help new arrivals acclimate to their surroundings, Megan Jo Collum, an agent with Country House Realty in the Catskills and Hudson Valley, makes a habit of asking sellers for a list of approved service professionals at closing. \u201cThat way the buyers get a little local services \u2018Rolodex\u2019 of people who have some recent history with the house, so the buyers aren\u2019t starting from scratch,\u201d she said. Buyers who are clients of Amy Rosen, an agent with Ruth Gale Realty in Phoenicia, N.Y., likewise have asked for information on how to gird a home for changing seasons and against determined wildlife. \u201cI am always asked for advice on trash management, a hot topic around here. Bears get into it all easily if you don\u2019t know the tricks!\u201d she said. Ms. Rosen recommends putting trash out at the very last minute on the morning of pick-up day, or taking it directly to the dump, which often requires a small fee per bag and means more time in the car, another aspect of rural living.  There are also services, like Home Sweet Hudson, a rental management company in Rosendale, N.Y., operated by Vanessa and Ray Vargas, that can help local and remote property owners looking to outsource tasks like home maintenance checks and repairs, snow plowing, and pest management. Rates start at $50 per hour. The falling leaves and incoming chill of winter have others realizing they may be a little late in prepping for seasonal shifts. In July, Katie King, 41, left a rental apartment in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Lefferts Gardens with her husband and two sons, ages 6 and 4, and moved to a four-bedroom cabin in New Jersey with a wood-burning fireplace and views of Lake Shawnee, for which they paid $300,000. \u201cIt\u2019s colder here, that is surprising, and prepping for seasons has been different already,\u201d said Ms. King of the property, which is 40 minutes west of Manhattan. Though they were recently able to get a cord of firewood for the short term, $275 for a supply lasting a month or two, they\u2019re already strategizing for the future. \u201cWe now know that next year we\u2019ll have to order months in advance before the cold season hits.\u201d  This is a sentiment echoed by Igor Tumasov, 30, a sales leader for IBM Watson, and his fianc\u00e9e, Ally Tam, 29, who works in venture capital. In April, the couple closed on a two-bedroom home in a remote section of Mount Tremper, N.Y., near Woodstock, which was built in 1973. The soonest they can get their boiler serviced is January 2021, a scheduling setback that was unexpected. \u201cNow I know for next year,\u201d Mr. Tumasov said. Turning to neighbors was an analgesic for adapting to full-time country living for Katie Deedy, founder of Grow House Grow, a bespoke wallpaper and tile company. Though Ms. Deedy, 39, and her husband, William Robison, have owned their cottage in Stockport, N.Y., in Columbia County, since February 2019, a foreclosed property they bought for $75,000, the pandemic put an immediate halt to a series of vital home repairs that had been in motion. In late March, the contractor they had been using suddenly disappeared. \u201cTwo weeks after we gutted the kitchen in March, we suddenly found ourselves quarantining and living there full-time. No sink, no stove, it was nuts,\u201d she said. Running her business full time, sans Wi-Fi, and settling their 10-year-old daughter, Ruby, into a remote learning routine only added to the pressure to bring functionality to the circa 1890 home. A $100 plastic utility sink provided a temporary fix. A few weeks later, their water heater blew and they needed a new washer and dryer as well. It is an all-new and pricey reality for the longtime Brooklyn renters, who had been attending to piecemeal cottage repairs on weekends. The home now also needs gutters, updated windows and a new roof. Since their daughter\u2019s school went remote full time, the family spends about five days a week upstate. With a shortage of available contractors and the imminent winter weather, Ms. Deedy and her husband have bartered with neighbors. In return for assistance installing a wood stove, they will help one neighbor affix new siding to their house. \u201cBecause of Covid, we\u2019ve been able to make really special relationships with some of our neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe help each other, and it\u2019s allowed us to get some work done we couldn\u2019t have due to the contractor scarcity. They\u2019re amazing. It really is the silver lining.\u201d For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate.",

But Mr. Pai undid the rules within a year of being appointed by President Trump. Mr. Pai eliminated lower-profile rules governing the telecommunications industry, loosening media ownership restrictions and lifting some price caps in the lucrative market for business broadband connections. He also faced a global race to develop next generation wireless networks and more recently was drawn into the debate over the rules governing social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.

    "article_text": "\u2018Assume that you were exposed\u2019: Officials warn of the fallout from Thanksgiving travel. While many in the United States celebrated a muted Thanksgiving over Zoom, millions of people traveled instead, rejecting the advice of public officials. According to Transportation Safety Administration data, about 800,000 to one million people passed through T.S.A. checkpoints each day in the days before and after the holiday \u2014 far lower than the same period last year, but likely far higher than epidemiologists had hoped to see. A United Airlines spokeswoman, Annabelle Cottee, said the week of Thanksgiving was \u201cthe busiest since March\u201d for the carrier. Americans also took to the roads. AAA predicted significant declines in bus, train and cruise travel, but predicted only a modest drop in car travel. For several days leading up to Thanksgiving, as case numbers and hospitalizations across the country grew exponentially, political leaders and medical experts warned of the dangers of compounding the virus spread by being with others. In November alone, there have been more than 4.1 million cases and more than 25,500 deaths. There were 91,635 current hospitalizations as of Nov. 28, according to the Covid Tracking Project, almost twice as many as there were on Nov. 1, and triple the number on Oct. 1. Aware of the emotional resonance of the holiday, experts tried to thread a narrative from these numbers that would convince people of the danger. Their warnings were direct \u2014 sometimes stern, sometimes impassioned pleas. \u201cKeep the gatherings, the indoor gatherings as small as you possibly can,\u201d Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week. By making that sacrifice, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to prevent people from getting infected.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was also urging people not to travel. \u201cAll Americans want to do what they can to protect their loved ones,\u201d Dr. Henry Walke, a Covid-19 incident manager at the C.D.C., said at a news briefing. And though it would have been unrealistic to expect a public that is restive from months of restrictions to universally abide by such recommendations, the aftermath of those decisions will begin to unfold in the weeks ahead. Dr. Fauci, during an appearance on the Sunday news program \u201cThis Week,\u201d said the best course for Thanksgiving travelers might be \u201cto quarantine yourself for a period of time.\u201d Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that travelers \u201chave to assume that you were exposed and you became infected and you really need to get tested in the next week.\u201d She urged that travelers avoid anyone in their family over 65 or with underlying illnesses. That guidance comes as the C.D.C. is considering shortening the recommended isolation period for infected people. And while it is too early to know if holiday travel will affect the virus\u2019s spread, new research suggests that people are most infectious about two days before symptoms begin and for five days afterward, meaning this week will likely be crucial in containment. On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City urged residents who had ignored official guidance and attended Thanksgiving gatherings to get tested. In anticipation of a renewed demand, the city has opened 25 new testing locations in the last week. It will also now post online the wait times at its testing sites, which had seen growing lines as New Yorkers scrambled to get tests before their holiday plans. The city\u2019s seven-day average positive test rate was at 4.03 percent, Mr. de Blasio said, but he warned that the data may be skewed because fewer tests were conducted during Thanksgiving weekend. \u201cSome of our numbers may be skewed by that,\u201d he said. The U.S. map shows a country where almost every region is a hot spot. States that were once spared, like Montana and Wyoming, have reported record deaths and infections, while states that were pummeled in the first wave are straining anew. On Sunday, California became the first state to report more than 100,000 cases in a week, according to a New York Times database. And in New Jersey, hospitalizations have increased 60 percent in the last two weeks and deaths have increased by 78 percent. Over three days in November, the positivity rate in Newark, the largest city in the state, was 19 percent. \u201cWe begged people to have a somber, respectful, small Thanksgiving,\u201d Gov. Philip D. Murphy said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cAnd I want to give a shout out to New Jerseyans because I think overwhelmingly that\u2019s what happened, but there\u2019s a lot of fatigue out there.\u201d Mr. Murphy called the next few months \u201cthe fight of our lives,\u201d while also citing the progress of vaccines and noting that there was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201d And there was something to celebrate on Sunday in New York City, at least for some parents, when Mr. de Blasio announced that he would reopen the city\u2019s public elementary schools, abruptly shifting policy after an outcry from critics who questioned why gyms and bars remained open while schools were shut.",

    "article_text": "Rudy Giuliani is the latest Trump associate to get the coronavirus President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Giuliani \u201chas tested positive for the China Virus,\u201d Trump tweeted, using the racist term he habitually uses for the coronavirus. \u201cGet better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\u201d Giuliani\u2019s positive test comes roughly two weeks after his son tested positive. It\u2019s unclear how and when Giuliani contracted the virus. Giuliani has been traveling constantly across the country in recent weeks, leading Trump\u2019s failing legal efforts to contest the results of the 2020 presidential election, and has been in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona \u2014 all states with high virus case numbers \u2014 in the past two weeks. He has been in contact with members of Trump\u2019s legal team in recent days, as well as witnesses incorrectly alleging voting improprieties, and Michigan lawmakers.  On Wednesday, he participated in testimony falsely claiming that votes were illegally cast in Michigan in an indoor, largely maskless session before Michigan\u2019s House Oversight Committee. Depending on when Giuliani was infected, those in attendance may be at risk of exposure. The president did not say on Sunday whether Giuliani is symptomatic, or if he plans to isolate to avoid infecting others with Covid-19. At 76 years old and male, he is in a group considered to be at greater risk for complications and more negative outcomes of the disease.  Giuliani is the latest of many figures and staffers in the president\u2019s orbit to contract the coronavirus, including Trump himself, much of the president\u2019s family, his chief of staff, multiple senior advisers, and the White House press secretary. All together, more than a dozen people in the president\u2019s personal orbit have tested positive since October. Some of this spread has been attributed to the fact that Trump\u2019s inner circle has routinely declined to wear masks and abide by social distancing protocols. For instance, the president has held a number of large, maskless indoor events \u2014 including a party celebrating Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. That party was labeled a superspreader event by top federal infectious disease expert and national coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci.  Giuliani has participated in a number of these sorts of high-risk events, from the hearing on Wednesday to a rally the former mayor held for Trump ahead of the election. Like many on the president\u2019s team, Giuliani has not shown strong support for precautions like mask-wearing; in October, Giuliani criticized President-elect Joe Biden for his mask-wearing habit and said that his use of them was meant to induce fear. \u201cIt isn\u2019t science to be wearing that mask, Joe, when you are giving a speech and people are 30-40 feet away from you,\u201d Giuliani said during an interview with Fox News. \u201cThe only thing you can infect is the teleprompter that\u2019s near you. So, I see through you. That\u2019s a political statement to scare people, wearing that mask. You do not need that mask when you are standing at a podium.\u201d",

    "article_text": "How to keep your houseplants (and yourself) less miserable this winter  Winter will suck. We gathered some of Vox\u2019s coziest minds to help you make it suck less. So you\u2019ve acquired a houseplant during the Covid-19 pandemic. Or several. Or dozens. You\u2019re certainly not alone. Next to cultivating sourdough, gardening has become one of the most popular Covid-19 pandemic hobbies across the United States as people spend more time at home, overwhelming plant nurseries that are still trying to maintain social distancing precautions. \u201cI can tell you that we have seen worldwide interest in gardening that has approximately doubled in terms of individual participation from 2019 to 2020,\u201d said Dave Whitinger, executive director of the National Gardening Association, in an email. \u201cThe number of website visitors to garden.org is twice as high as last year, and most of the gardening companies we have spoken with have reported approximately the same thing. The gardening companies I have spoken to have all told me they have completely sold out their inventory this year.\u201d With so many restrictions on going outside, it seems natural to want to bring some of the outdoors inside (or at least close by). Plants bring us numerous benefits. Beyond the obvious aesthetics, your pothos plants, African violets, and succulents can relieve stress and boost productivity. (Their air-cleaning benefits, however, are a bit more questionable.) But now as we head into the winter, when cooler outdoor air becomes less hospitable to fingers and fronds alike, first-time gardeners are facing the challenge of nurturing their new charges through one of the toughest times of year. To find out more, I called up experts at the United States Botanic Garden in Washington, DC. It\u2019s the oldest continuously operating botanic garden in the US and turns 200 this year. It contains nearly 29,000 square feet of indoor growing space, in addition to five acres of outdoor gardens. Its 65,000-plant collection includes chocolate plants, orchids, the endangered aloalo flower, and the crown jewels, two 8-foot-tall flowers that look like deformed penises and smell like rotting corpses. I figured they would know a thing or two about keeping fussy plants alive. Whether your thumbs are barely turning green or you\u2019re an aspiring plantfluencer, here\u2019s what to know about keeping your plants (and maybe yourself) happy and healthy through the cold months. The first step in getting your household foliage to survive the winter is to do some homework. That can involve doing some research in a plant database to learn more about the ideal conditions for your plant, like temperatures, sunlight, and soil. You can also look up the US Department of Agriculture hardiness zone you live in, which can help determine which of your plants can survive the winter outdoors and which need the warmth of your home. \u201cGetting a little bit of background of the plants is probably one of the most critical things for winter care,\u201d said Angela Weber-Hetrick, the gardens and grounds supervisor at the US Botanic Garden. \u201cTropical needs are a lot different than your hardy plants, or Zone 7a, which is what we are here in the DC area.\u201d Plants themselves are quite varied, so it\u2019s difficult to come up with broad recommendations for every bit of greenery. Weber-Hetrick explained that there are plants that do winter prep of their own. Many plants, but particularly perennials that experience winters in the wild, can go dormant when the season changes. That\u2019s when the plant stops growing actively. Its leaves and stems may even fall off, but the root structure is still alive. (A general way to test whether a plant is alive is to bend the stem. If it\u2019s pliable, it\u2019s alive, but if it\u2019s brittle, it\u2019s probably dead.)  The signs of dormancy can be subtle in houseplants. It can be as simple as their growth slowing. But not every piece of vegetation hunkers down for the season. Succulents like aloe go dormant in the summer while other succulents like agave go dormant in the winter, for example.  When it comes to plants that go dormant in the winter, it\u2019s all the more critical for them to be at their healthiest as the days get shorter. \u201cIn fall, they\u2019re starting to store up all their carbohydrates, and really what they are trying to do is basically store as much energy as they can to make it through the winter,\u201d Weber-Hetrick said. Tropical plants, like philodendron, cane, and bamboo, also respond to shorter days with less growth, thereby consuming less water and fertilizer. And other species may need some trimming to get rid of dead branches or decaying leaves. \u201cSometimes it needs a good pruning, a good haircut, before going into the winter months,\u201d Weber-Hetrick said. But regardless of the species, once winter begins, you, the plant owner, become the gatekeeper for almost everything that a plant needs to survive if it\u2019s kept indoors. So it\u2019s on you to figure out what your garden needs. Every home has its own terroir, and general plant care guidelines may be too vague for your porch, windowsill, or hanging basket. That\u2019s why your own observations are crucial. \u201cYou can kind of \u2018listen to your plants\u2019 in terms of just kind of looking at them,\u201d said Chelsea McKinley, a plant health specialist at the US Botanic Garden. \u201cIf it seems like they\u2019re drying out more frequently and they\u2019re putting out more growth, then that\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re ready for more water and maybe for some light fertilizing.\u201d Throughout the winter, here are some of the key things to observe on roots, stems, leaves, and buds to help your plants thrive. Pests: Make sure there aren\u2019t any stowaways on plants you bring inside, and keep an eye out for any critters that could harm them, like aphids and mealybugs. Check the undersides of leaves for even tinier pests like spider mites. \u201cThey usually cause a silvering or yellowing of the leaves,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cThose you might need a magnifying glass to see.\u201d If you are repotting or moving plants to a different container, make sure the new vessel is sterile. Use a mild bleach solution and rinse thoroughly to prevent bacterial or fungal infections. Light: Plants depend on photosynthesis, the process by which they use light, carbon dioxide, and water to make sugar and oxygen. With the sun going down earlier, every photon is precious. Some plants can cope with less light, but others may need the assistance of a growing lamp. Check to make sure what kind of lighting your plant needs and ensure your lighting source is adequate, especially if it\u2019s a supplemental source. \u201cYou just want to make sure that lightbulb is fairly bright and has both red and blue wavelengths in the spectrum,\u201d McKinley said. If you are just relying on sunlight, the optimal position can change through the winter, so be prepared to move your plants. Temperature: As it gets cold outside, it becomes more important to maintain warmth inside. Though some plants like orchids prefer a bit of a nighttime drop in temperature, most prefer steady conditions, so avoid placing them in drafty areas. Water: Both too much and too little water can be harmful. That can manifest as wilting or yellowing leaves. But rather than waiting for a plant to show signs of distress, one sign that a plant may be ready to water is if the top centimeter or two of soil is dry. \u201cWhen you do water, make sure the entire root bulb gets really wet,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cYou want about 10 percent of the water you put into the pot to come out the bottom of the pot.\u201d This helps flush out salt in the root structure. But make sure the water drains away and that the plant doesn\u2019t remain sitting in water. Some chemicals in tap water can also be harmful to plants, leading to problems like yellowing leaves. You can use distilled water or leave some water out for 24 hours to allow residual chlorine to evaporate out. Humidity: Running the furnace in the winter can dry out the air in your home. And as dry, heated air parches your throat, it can desiccate plants as well. A humidifier can help reduce these effects. So can misting plants with a spray bottle. Maintaining proper humidity can also reduce the need for watering. But make sure to wipe down leaves after misting since tap water can leave behind mineral deposits as it evaporates. A wipe will also remove household dust that can block sunlight.  Balancing all of these elements may be tricky at first, but over time, it should get easier to establish a plant care rhythm and routine. \u201cPlants love consistency,\u201d Weber-Hetrick said. If you\u2019re looking for inspiration, you can also explore the US Botanic Garden virtually. And while we\u2019re all housebound this winter with our aloes, begonias, and cacti, know that it\u2019s totally okay to talk to your plants; just be cautious if they start talking back. ",

    "article_text": "A Scandinavian local explains how to make it through winter Winter will suck. We gathered some of Vox\u2019s coziest minds to help you make it suck less. Ida Skibenes, a 32-year-old born and raised in Norway, resides in Bergen, where by December, there is an average of six hours of daylight per day. Shorter days mean more time spent inside, sheltering from the cold. But as a result, Scandinavians are familiar with the business of creating bearable winters for themselves, bringing small joys to where despair might typically occur.  Seasonal depression affects around 10 million Americans, and winter may be even more difficult to manage for many as the pandemic continues on, and forces us to spend more time at home. We could use some Norwegian advice \u2014 \u201chygge,\u201d a culture of coziness that has taken over the self-care space, is Scandinavia\u2019s specialty. They\u2019ve mastered and perfected the art of making winter less miserable. Skibenes spoke to Vox about how she survives winter, and her methods to combat feelings of isolation that come with the colder months of the year. Tell me a little bit about your relationship with cold winters over the course of your life. Do you like winter? Do you not like winter? I think growing up here you get used to it. You kind of don\u2019t have a choice. Of course, some people will travel south, especially the older generation who will leave for Spain or Italy for a month or two when it gets really cold and really dark. But most of us just deal with it. We are used to having many months in a row where we don\u2019t really see that much sun or daylight. When it\u2019s at its darkest, I think most people will struggle a little, maybe feel a little more tired. Especially if you work in an office and you don\u2019t have the chance to step outside and get some sunlight on your face. It can be pretty hard because it\u2019s dark when you leave in the morning and then it\u2019s dark when you get home. I struggle with how early it gets dark even in New York. Do you have any tips to combat that difficulty? In some ways, [I\u2019ve experienced it.] Especially with feeling more tired than in the summer months. That might be the hardest part. But I\u2019m a full winter girl, so I kind of appreciate the dark. I think it\u2019s cozier to get up in the morning when it\u2019s dark outside.  I think that the most important thing you can do is keep your sleeping rhythm the same. Try to, if you have the chance during your day, get out and get some sun. If it\u2019s only for like ten minutes, I think it can make a huge difference. We also have really bad weather, especially in November and December. It can be very tempting to just stay inside and just hunker down and wait for it to pass, but I think it\u2019s really important to get that fresh air and just move around a little. In Norway, we are very much professionals when it comes to making things cozy. Lighting candles and being under a blanket on a couch and playing games, so that\u2019s in our blood I think. I actually wanted to ask you about that. I\u2019ve read that the Scandinavian culture of coziness is called hygge. Can you tell me more about that? I think Norway may be most explicit about it. We go all in. I think maybe it\u2019s the way that we\u2019ve kind of learned to survive through hard winters for a long time. We find a lot of comfort in just doing the really small things to make your home a bit more cozy and just lighten the mood. And a lot of us have grown up staying in family cabins \u2014  that\u2019s a thing, where we would go to a cabin up in the mountains or by the sea or somewhere else. That\u2019s a peak level of coziness when you get to the cabin and you light the candles and play games and eat a lot of food. How it got that way, I\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s just become this thing that most of us do, just a way of surviving those long months. So it\u2019s kind of like this culture of togetherness and warmth; it\u2019s kind of like a purposeful escape from the dreariness of winter. I think it\u2019s interesting because we as a people here in Norway, we\u2019re generally quite cold. We like to keep our distance from people. On the news now with Covid-19, they [say] \u201cWhat did Norway do right? What did they do that we didn\u2019t do?\u201d And I think that often they miss the point of us being people that really, generally don\u2019t like being around people that much.  We kind of just stay with the people we know and the people we love, and we don\u2019t socialize that much with people we don\u2019t know. Especially now during the winter months, we don\u2019t really go that much outside anyways, so I think it\u2019s easier for us to socially distance than other people. I think that\u2019s a part of the coziness culture as well, that we have this kind of small group. Maybe it\u2019s just a partner or maybe it\u2019s a couple of friends or maybe it\u2019s just a couple of family members that you\u2019re really close with, and that\u2019s your flock. What about the way that Norwegian people prep for the cold in the way they get dressed? Is there anything clothing-wise that you would recommend to Americans who want to make their winter less miserable or cozier? We use a lot of wool. From top to bottom. Immediately, as soon as we hit the end of September, start of October, that\u2019s when we get our wool game on. If you\u2019re going to survive winter either in Norway or anywhere else where it\u2019s cold, that\u2019s the thing to do. It\u2019s important for us to stay warm throughout the day, because if you get cold then you\u2019ll be cold for the rest of the day and you\u2019ll be miserable. Especially socks and hats. If you\u2019re warm on your feet and warm on your head, then you\u2019re basically covered.  Layering and always wool. The first layer is always wool.  When it gets really cold like December and January, I always have a million layers on. But I always feel like I look so bulky. I imagine that in Norway, people find a way to look more chic about it. Some of us try \u2014  especially the younger generation. I don\u2019t know how they do it, but they look flawless. But for most of us, especially from 30 years and up, we only like being comfortable, and warm is more important than looking good. And is there any way that Norwegians approach winter skin care or beauty or self-care habits that you would recommend to Americans? Moisturize. I\u2019m terrible at skincare in general, but moisturizing is number one. L\u2019Occitane has this really awesome face cream that I would recommend to anyone who has to live through the cold months because it really helps keep your face moisturized throughout the day. Is anything else, winter tip wise, that you want to add that our readers should know about how you get through the winter, whether it\u2019s physically or emotionally, and how a Scandinavian view informs it? People will react to dark and colder months in different ways, and I think just embracing whatever you\u2019re feeling [is important.] Telling yourself that it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re more tired, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to go outside, and it\u2019s okay if you feel less energized and don\u2019t want to socialize much, or anything that you\u2019re feeling. Just embrace what you\u2019re going through, because it is hard when it\u2019s so dark all the time, and maybe your sleeping rhythm is a bit off and your eating rhythm is a bit off. Be a bit more aware of self-care. Of course, right now it\u2019s hard to not isolate. So keep in touch with your friends, and if you have a partner, talk to your partner about how you\u2019re doing. Just embrace the time that you\u2019re in.",

    "article_text": "You can survive winter and not spread Covid-19. Here\u2019s how. Winter and the holidays can be hard times even in typical years: short days, cold winds, seasonal blues, and family stress, to name a few of the challenges many of us face. But the ongoing Covid-19 surge, with more than 100,000 new cases of the virus reported every day since November 5, is putting the hallmark activities that can help sustain us through the darker days \u2014 holiday gatherings, meals with friends, volunteering, or a visit to see Santa \u2014 in more dire limbo.  Despite being nine months into the pandemic, figuring out whether and how to approach a previously routine activity or event is still complicated and often stress-inducing. And the calculus seems to change with new case rates and evolving guidelines \u2014 and with our own fluctuating pandemic burnout.  The hard fact is that, especially with the surge in Covid-19 cases, \u201call activities are going to have some risk of being impinged upon by the virus,\u201d says Amesh Adalja, a physician and faculty member of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health\u2019s department of environmental health and engineering.  And doing things with people you know \u2014 but aren\u2019t living with \u2014 can heighten that risk. Just because you know and love (or loathe) them, a family member or old acquaintance doesn\u2019t have any lower risk of bringing or catching the virus than a stranger. And it will likely make you less careful than if you were interacting with a stranger.  A big part of the challenge in avoiding Covid-19 is that it spreads before people start showing symptoms. So you or anyone else can show up to a gathering feeling the picture of health only to spread the virus to those you come into close contact with.  We talked with epidemiologists and other health experts about the safest \u2014 and riskiest \u2014 ways to see others, keep kids busy, help out, and travel this winter during the pandemic.  (Note: Activities are ranked relatively within each category, so a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk in one category does not carry the same relative risk as \u201cmoderate\u201d in another category.) Here is what they said.  Whether you usually celebrate Hanukkah, Christmas, Festivus, New Year\u2019s, or a birthday this time of year, it\u2019s likely that plans for a get-together will need to be adapted \u2014 if not scuttled altogether.  For one, having people from different households together is risky. But that\u2019s, of course, what many of us are used to this time of year. In the Before Times, more than 85 percent of Americans planned to attend a gathering with extended family or friends for the holidays. And the average holiday meal included about 11 people. Now, in many states, that exceeds the limit allowed for private gatherings. (The maximum is 10 or fewer \u2014 sometimes as few as five \u2014 in many places, including Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Washington, DC, as well as some counties of West Virginia. And in some states \u2014 including Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin \u2014 many gatherings cannot include people from other households at all.)  In many places, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do anything with people you aren\u2019t actively living with [because] there\u2019s so much virus spreading out in the community,\u201d says Lisa Gralinski, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. For example, an area with more than 5 percent of tests coming back positive indicates that there is undocumented community spread. Few areas in the country have test positivity rates below that. Even in those places, she says, \u201cI would encourage people to be incredibly cautious.\u201d  As Krysia Lindan, an epidemiologist at the University of California San Francisco, notes in an email to Vox, it is especially important to \u201cavoid multi-generational gatherings that include older adults and those with pre-disposing health conditions.\u201d Expected family time might need to be skipped this year. \u201cThis may be the year not to invite your young adult children to come home or, conversely, to visit your parents or grandparents,\u201d Lindan writes. (Even if a college student is \u201cdistance-learning\u201d near campus, \u201cYou may want to really check what they have been doing,\u201d she says. \u201cTransmission among people in colleges has been high.\u201d)  If you\u2019re still considering gathering in person, whether with family or friends, assemble all the potential guests virtually first to have an open and detailed conversation about the risks, goals, and ground rules for the get-together, reminding people that everyone is bringing all of their exposures from the previous two weeks to the event, Keri Althoff, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advised in a November press briefing. This call should include naming a point person who will be notified if anyone starts getting symptoms and/or tests positive in the two weeks after the event and who will also call all the other guests to tell them if they need to quarantine and/or get tested, she said.  And there\u2019s one more step to take after the gathering: Quarantine for at least 10 days (or a week if you get a negative test result). This will allow you or anyone else to detect any cases of Covid-19 that might have resulted from the gathering and not spread them back out into the community.  Here are considerations for different formats of gatherings this season:  It\u2019s hard to pass the dessert when you\u2019re celebrating on Zoom. But it\u2019s also impossible to pass Covid-19.  Althoff said that although she loves visiting her \u201cginormous\u201d family in Iowa, she won\u2019t be seeing them in person this year. Instead, she is planning to partake in video toasts and virtual game nights with family and friends.  Other ideas include having everyone make the same food or drink to enjoy during the call or playing a game of charades \u2014 or even enlisting kids to provide entertainment.  For some, seeing others in person is not something they are willing to hold off on until there is widespread vaccination. So the safest way to do this is by keeping gatherings small, brief, outdoors, distanced, and continuously masked \u2014 which means no food and drink.  \u201cOutside is where we want to be if we want to be together,\u201d says Jodie Guest, vice-chair of the department of epidemiology at Emory University\u2019s Rollins School of Public Health. She also recommends keeping it under a total of 10 people \u2014 with only one or (if your area permits it) two other households \u2014 and keeping everyone separated by household pod.  One caution this time of year is to be mindful of outdoor heaters. They can help extend the outdoor season, but if too many people are crowded around them, that could increase the risk of disease spread. As Guest notes, she bought two heaters for her porch: one for her household and the other, spaced far away, for one couple they see regularly, outdoors.  If eating and/or drinking are non-negotiable, \u201cConsider having tables spaced around outside and people within bubbles or family units seated together,\u201d Lindan writes. Guest adds that everyone should be masked when they\u2019re not eating or drinking. People should also be mindful of alcohol consumption, she says, as it reduces inhibitions, making people less likely to stick with safety protocols and more likely to revert to pre-pandemic socializing behaviors.  If you decide having people together indoors is the only option, there are several things you can do to decrease the risk of turning your event into a Covid-19 outbreak. Most of the usual advice applies: Ensure people keep their masks on at all times and remain physically distant. Keeping households in different areas \u201cis not perfect,\u201d says Gralinski, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than completely intermingling and being right next to each other.\u201d  Keep it short, and limit the number of people attending. And increase air circulation by opening windows, turning on fans, and cranking on the central AC or heat, Althoff said. But be forewarned that although a gathering might be set up with the best of plans \u2014 distanced seats, open windows, masks \u2014 indoor risk is higher than outdoor risk, says Adalja. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s a social gathering with friends or family that [people] feel comfortable around.\u201d  Another option is to have everyone test and quarantine beforehand. Here\u2019s how: Now, if everyone is negative, the gathering could proceed with slightly less worry about spreading Covid-19.  Adalja recommends doing some research on testing first. Many places are facing delays returning results, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association has warned of increased stress on testing capacity and shortages of testing equipment ahead of the holidays.  Also, as Adalja points out, \u201cTest results are not ironclad \u2014 just look at the White House,\u201d where top-level officials are tested regularly but there have still been numerous outbreaks.  If someone is unable to effectively quarantine upon arrival (say, a young adult who comes home to their parents\u2019 house and is unable to remain entirely separate from other household members), the next best option is to at least get everyone tested and attempt as much of a quarantine as possible while awaiting results, says Lindan.  A standard, sit-down indoor meal with anyone outside of your household presents a substantially increased risk of transmitting the virus. Other things that further increase the risk include a large number of people, multiple households, a lengthy gathering, physical closeness \u2014 whether that\u2019s people packed into a kitchen cooking together or around a table \u2014 limited mask-wearing, and shouting (it was an election year, after all) or singing (hold the holiday songs).  \u201cI would just avoid large gatherings indoors at all costs,\u201d Lindan says. \u201cI know it\u2019s really hard.\u201d  Outside, outside, and mostly outside is what experts say as a general rule for kid activities this winter. To that end, if you live in a colder climate, it\u2019s an important year to make sure you have warm outdoor gear that fits your kids well. That said, there are some caveats to this guidance. Not all outdoor activities are created equal, and there could be some indoor ones that, if done responsibly, could carry slightly less risk. It\u2019s also important to remember that \u201cthe virus survives longer in the winter due to the lower temperature and lower humidity, resulting in increased risk of transmission in winter compared to summer,\u201d Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious disease at the UC Davis Children\u2019s Hospital, writes in an email to Vox. Of course, the activities that carry the lowest risk of Covid-19 for kids are the same as adults: avoiding exposure to anyone outside the household, whether it\u2019s indoors or out. This could mean there\u2019s more screen time this winter \u2014 including those video calls with family and friends. Or time offline doing crafts (particularly to give to people you cannot see in person) or house projects, such as cleaning out old toys and clothing to donate. Or bundling up for outdoor activities away from other households, such as exploring quiet parks, hiking, biking, or sledding.  What about all of those museums and movie theaters that were key \u2014 especially during long school breaks \u2014 in Before Times? \u201cIf you\u2019re going to a kids museum where you\u2019re restricting the number of people, and everybody\u2019s wearing a mask and hand-washing, and they have good air filtration, that\u2019s probably okay,\u201d Lindan says.  Adalja agrees. Even though a museum is indoors, \u201cif they\u2019re distanced and wearing masks, that becomes an obstacle that\u2019s harder for the virus to overcome.\u201d That said, some experts caution that other indoor activities \u2014 even though they might seem to have similar precautions \u2014 carry higher risk, especially if local case numbers are high. \u201cIf there is increased transmission in your community, then an indoor activity like a movie theater is risky,\u201d noted Blumberg. \u201cThere may be compromising of social distancing in common areas, such as corridors and bathrooms, and people may not be masking at all times as they sip their soda or snack.\u201d  According to the experts we spoke with, a busy playground might bring higher risk of Covid-19 transmission than a quiet indoor activity in which all of the best protocols are being followed.  For example, \u201cplaygrounds \u2014 those are not ever going to be without risk,\u201d Adalja says. Not all kids are diligent about wearing their masks, surfaces are very high-touch, and it\u2019s essentially impossible to keep children physically distanced. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk where you have to make an individual risk calculation,\u201d he says. Also, outdoor sports in which kids come into contact with one another increase the risk of transmission, as could crowded outdoor events or activities, especially those where people do not always have their masks on (such as for eating or drinking).  Families are all having to make the best decisions for themselves. And keeping kids isolated from others, especially on school breaks or when schools are remote, is not always feasible. Adalja suggests some things families can do to lower the risk in these situations. Continue to avoid any crowded indoor spaces where you will come into contact with other households. Instead, work with another family or two (if permitted in your locality) to establish a small group of children for in-person visits, ensuring everyone is comfortable with each household\u2019s risks and behavior \u2014 and stressing hand-washing.  \u201cThe whole thing is about weighing risks and benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cChildren playing is crucial for psychosocial development. It is a balancing act.\u201d But high levels of community transmission can tip those scales and make in-person activities with friends too risky for many. And any time group visits can be outdoors, that will help lower the risk.  As a result of the pandemic, millions of people in the US are struggling to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. More people need help this winter than perhaps any other time in the past 80-plus years. So there has been no better time to find ways to help others.  Thinking about and helping others is a really important way to combat anxiety and stress and a feeling of helplessness \u2014 all of which are currently pervasive.  \u201cIt\u2019s always good to volunteer, and doing so might lighten the sadness of not being able to see family and friends as in years past,\u201d Lindan writes.  Guest agrees: \u201cI do think people are hungry for ways to help each other right now.\u201d  Charitable organizations can often stretch donated money further than donated goods. So financial contributions are especially helpful, in addition to being Covid-19 transmission-free. Established charity-rating sites, such as GuideStar or Charity Navigator, can tell you how much of your contribution will go directly to the cause.  The next safest way to help out this season is through contact-free volunteering or donations. This could be a formal, organized effort, like contributing food to a local pantry, or it could be personal efforts, like arranging grocery or meal deliveries for higher-risk community members.  Guest notes that these kinds of efforts can also safely be turned into a shared experience of sorts \u2014 such as organizing a coat or blanket drive with friends, family, or neighbors. (She suggests quarantining the donated goods for three days before you touch them.)  There are many organizations that rely heavily on behind-the-scenes volunteers. Food pantries or clothing and household goods distribution centers might offer opportunities to donate time and help in a slightly safer environment than, say, serving meals. Before you go, find out how many other people you will be working with, if they require masks, and how long you will be expected to work (shorter shifts are better for limiting exposure).  You shouldn\u2019t have to look far for opportunities to contribute this way in your area, says Guest: Since the start of the pandemic, \u201cthe need for volunteers has only gotten bigger.\u201d  If you want to do more personal work, first check in with places where you might want to volunteer and ask if they are accepting in-person help and what precautions they are taking. For instance, if you want to serve meals, ask how many people they allow in at any time, if people are required to have masks, how often the organization cleans the area, and whether you will be the only one touching serving utensils, Guest notes.  \u201cYou should continue to use the same precautions as always when in a group setting \u2014 masks, even face shields, hand-washing, and distancing to the extent possible,\u201d Lindan writes.  The highest-risk ways to give back this year are those where you volunteer in person in a place where lots of people live, whether that\u2019s a homeless shelter or an assisted living facility. Each carries different risks in terms of acquiring the virus or passing it along. But, as Guest notes, most of these places are being quite careful in terms of their protocol around any outside people (and whether they allow them at all). Even so, it\u2019s still good to check on their practices first. You can also ask if there are other ways your time or money could be even more valuable to them than serving in person.  Traveling during the holidays is usually a little hellish: crowded planes, overheated trains, and gridlocked automobiles. But this year, the specter of Covid-19 makes it that much more daunting.  \u201cGiven the rise in cases throughout many parts of the US, the best advice is to avoid travel at this time,\u201d Lindan writes. (By staying home, she adds, there\u2019s also a bonus of preventing a lot of excess carbon emissions this year.) The CDC has, in fact, asked people to avoid travel.  Travel right now can also get pretty complicated pretty quickly, and not just because you need to pack extra masks and hand sanitizer (and double that if traveling with kids).  More than 20 states now have travel advisories or orders \u2014 carrying fines of up to $10,000 for violating them \u2014 for some or all people to test, quarantine, and/or submit official paperwork if they will be visiting the state for more than 24 hours (i.e., not just traveling through). So that usual week-long visit to see family in California, New York, or Chicago, for example, isn\u2019t going to be as feasible. (Specific guidance is also available through the CDC\u2019s travel planner.) \u201cIt might be a logistical nightmare to make sure you\u2019re in compliance,\u201d Adalja said in a press briefing earlier this month. In addition to state or city guidelines for travel, many employers, schools, and day cares are issuing rules about travel, so Althoff advised reviewing those as well. \u201cBe ready to accept abrupt changes to your travel plans.\u201d  If you must travel this winter, there are ways to reduce your risk of catching or spreading the virus. Much of it depends on how you travel.  In this case, while you\u2019re in the car, you\u2019re just with your pod. But the key is to make it household members only. Expanding the roster to other people vastly increases the risk of this mode of travel, especially since \u201cIf you\u2019re taking a road trip with a bunch of your friends, you\u2019re more likely to be unmasked, and you\u2019re less likely to distance,\u201d Adalja says.  Things to consider along the way: where you\u2019ll eat, where you\u2019ll sleep, and where you\u2019ll make pit stops. Short pit stops to use a public bathroom should be okay, says Guest \u2014 just wear your mask and wash and/or sanitize your hands. Some travelers are choosing to bring their own open-air facilities on car trips these days.  \u201cThe safest is going to be being self-contained as much as possible,\u201d Gralinski says. For sleeping, that might mean renting a dwelling that you have entirely to yourself to stay in \u201cand bringing as many supplies as you possibly can.\u201d The idea is to minimize contact with others, which includes limiting trips to a local grocery store. For additional food, curbside pickup and drive-through are safest. What about hotels? A recent study in Nature, based on cellphone data of 98 million people in large cities, found that this spring, hotels and motels were fairly large drivers of Covid-19 spread \u2014 just below restaurants, gyms, and cafes. (Their data, though, is from March 1 to May 2, a period during which mask mandates and other Covid-19-prevention protocols were just starting.)  Adalja says these days hotels are taking many more precautions and should be fairly safe so long as you\u2019re careful. \u201cIt\u2019s not the hotel itself, it\u2019s what you do in the hotel,\u201d he says. So wear a face covering, wash your hands, and avoid other people (for example, skip the elevator, restaurant, bar, and lobby common areas).  For her part, Gralinski said she still avoids hotels. For a late-October vacation she and her husband took, they rented a camper to travel in. \u201cWe had our own bedroom, our own bathroom, got curbside takeout; we were pretty self-sufficient,\u201d she says. They would park in the driveways of friends\u2019 houses and see them safely from a distance outdoors. Even though it was cold, it worked. \u201cWe got to see friends, and it was amazing.\u201d  We still don\u2019t have definitive data on the safety of air travel right now. Many of the studies that looked at airplane risk \u2014 which did show cases of transmission \u2014 were carried out before masks were required.  Increasing the safety is the fact that masks are now mandated, and planes have very high rates of air circulation \u2014 replacing the full air of the cabin with clean air about 20 to 30 times per hour, thus hopefully removing more virus from air you might be breathing. \u201cThe data does show that airline travel is fairly safe right now if people are wearing face coverings,\u201d Adalja says.  But there are other downsides to flying, and they mostly have to do with other people. Namely, you\u2019re in close proximity to a lot of them \u2014 even with middle seats empty, as they remain on some, but not all, airlines \u2014 and you\u2019re largely at the mercy of their choices. Do they keep their mask on for the entire flight, or have it off for long stretches?  Another thing to be mindful of in air travel is that it involves a lot more than just sitting on a plane. \u201dIt\u2019s the whole experience,\u201d Althoff says, including airport shuttles, lines, lots of high-touch surfaces, and people mingling from all over the country, including areas with very high rates of transmission. If you\u2019re going to be in an airport, she advises to \u201cpractice your statement about how you will remind a stranger to maintain a distance.\u201d  Also, be prepared to remind people about masks. In airports and even in airplanes, \u201cinsouciant mask-wearing \u2014 by having them dangle from earlobes or positioned under the nose \u2014 still seems to happen,\u201d Lindan says. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to ask people to put on their masks when in the airport.\u201d  How can you lower your risk if you do decide to fly? Wear not only a good mask but also eye protection, such as sunglasses, safety glasses, goggles, or a face shield (with a mask), says Guest. Also, you can check to see if a flight will serve snacks or beverages. This used to be a perk, but these things now up the odds of virus transmission as people remove their masks to eat or drink, so you might want to avoid a flight with food and drink services if possible. \u201cIf you need to eat or drink something on a plane, do so when other people are not eating,\u201d Lindan writes. \u201cKeep your mask on, and only lift it up to insert food or drink into your mouth.\u201d  There has been even less research on train travel. A study from passenger trains in China relatively early in the pandemic \u2014 mid-December 2019 through early March 2020 \u2014 found Covid-19 spread fairly easily to nearby passengers on these trips, especially if people were in close proximity for more than three hours. Based on these findings, which were published over the summer, the authors suggested physical distancing, mask-wearing, and improved air filtration would lower the rate of spread on trains.  These are all steps Amtrak has instituted, along with enhanced cleaning and other measures. Trains also have the advantage of generally having fewer passengers per square foot than planes, and you might be more able to get away from someone who is not following the rules or appears ill. (Amtrak also offers private rooms on some trains.) However, experts we spoke with suggested it might still be slightly riskier than air travel. This is in part because distance train trips are more likely to be longer than a typical domestic flight, increasing your exposure time to others. Train cars also don\u2019t quite have the same rate of air replacement as an airplane cabin \u2014 Amtrak is promising clean air exchange 12 to 15 times an hour.  Like airports, there are also train stations to contend with \u2014 and there might be even less enforcement of rules, as they are typically more open to the public (rather than the majority of airport space being behind TSA checkpoint screening).  We also don\u2019t have a lot of solid scientific information about the risk of Covid-19 transmission on long-haul buses. But early research suggests this mode of travel could be riskier than planes or trains, especially when people aren\u2019t taking proper precautions. One case study showed how a single sick passenger on a bus in China infected 23 of 67 others on a drive that was less than an hour. Of note, though, is that in this superspreading event, which occurred in January 2020, none of the passengers were wearing masks, and the bus was recirculating air.  Bus companies in the US have updated safety protocols to help reduce spread of the virus. Greyhound, for example, requires face masks, has upped cleaning and sanitizing of its buses, replaces the bus air about 12 times per hour, and is \u201cencouraging\u201d passengers to physically distance.  Epidemiologists, however, are still warier of bus travel over other modes of transport right now. \u201cIt might be harder on a longer ride to keep your mask on, and it\u2019s probably not as enforced as it is on an airplane,\u201d Adalja says.  This winter is going to be different. But it doesn\u2019t have to be all bad unless we are determined to think of it that way. \u201cUsually people find the holidays stressful, so this could potentially be the year with less stress \u2014 just see what it feels like not to go to or host all those parties,\u201d Lindan writes. She calls it a year for \u201csome experimentation.\u201d She had a picnic on the beach for Thanksgiving. Guest suggests trying a distanced hike with loved ones instead of a typical meal or party.  We have an opportunity, through our actions, to make a real impact on the spread of the pandemic \u2014 not just among our own circles but in the broader community. This has important implications for health justice and equity because when the virus spreads, it is more likely to hit and cause greater harm to essential workers, their families, and people of color.  \u201cOur epidemic is only going to recede if people take the appropriate precautions,\u201d Lindan writes to Vox. \u201cThe problem is that we just do not want to do what we have to do.\u201d So this winter will take some acceptance, perseverance, and perspective.  How are epidemiologists putting this difficult season into perspective for themselves? For one, by \u201cacknowledging that this is hard and that the holidays of 2020 are going to look much different,\u201d Guest says. \u201cWe need to be cautious and protect each other now so that when we do get together [in the future] everyone we care about is there. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind so that these sacrifices now feel like they\u2019re worth it.\u201d  Lindan agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult over the holidays. We want to see our family and friends, and it\u2019s a really difficult task not to after living this way for so long. But it\u2019s a small price to pay for the long-term benefit.\u201d  And as Althoff reminds us, \u201cwe will be telling stories from these holidays for generations to come.\u201d It\u2019s largely in our control to make them the right ones.

    "article_text": "One Good Thing: This true crime podcast about a murderous doctor is even scarier during a pandemic One Good Thing is Vox\u2019s recommendations feature. In each edition, find one more thing from the world of culture that we highly recommend. I listen to a metric ton of true crime podcasts \u2014 so many that murder starts to seem run-of-the-mill. In that context, it\u2019s hard to overstate the eagerness I felt when I sat down to marathon the new, six-episode second season of Wondery\u2019s Dr. Death, the terrifying hit series about real doctors who knowingly inflict harm on their patients. I loved season one, and although both seasons of Dr. Death star host and medical journalist Laura Beil and have the same production team, the second season feels in many ways like a different, and weaker, series altogether.  But season two\u2019s change in direction has renewed my appreciation for season one and its combination of taut, gripping storytelling and an unforgettable close-up look at systemic failure. Dr. Death season one explored how institutional blind spots enabled a truly macabre central character to maim his patients over an 18-month surgical spree. In retrospect, it feels like a tale ready-made for a pandemic era, one of individual hubris married to society\u2019s tendency to reward unearned entitlement.   And while it might be a little perverse to find pleasure in a story of medical malpractice during such a pandemic, Dr. Death\u2019s first season stays fresh. The first season of Dr. Death, which launched in 2018 and ran for seven episodes, examined the life and horrific crimes of Christopher Duntsch. Duntsch is a former Dallas neurosurgeon who, through a staggering combination of personal incompetence and sociopathy mixed with institutional indifference, managed to leave a string of mangled patients in his wake.  Among these patients \u2014 victims \u2014 were two people who died as a result of injuries Duntsch knowingly inflicted. Over 18 months between 2011 and 2013, Duntsch bounced around Dallas-area surgical practices, botching the surgeries of at least 33 of his patients while evincing an air of arrogant expertise that fooled multiple hospitals into hiring him. This was despite his shaky track record and a string of alarmed surgeons who tried to sound warning bells.  The entire time, Duntsch, who grew up rich and entitled, seemed to be aware he was making mistakes; he falsified information on his CV and seemed to steamroll his critics on his way to the top. \u201cAnyone close to me thinks that I likely am something between god, Einstein and the antichrist,\u201d he wrote in an email at one point while he was practicing surgery, \u201cbecause how can I do anything I want and cross every discipline boundary like its a playground and never ever lose[?]\u201d A 2016 long-form article about Duntsch served as the basis for the 2018 podcast, which became a critically acclaimed hit and is currently being turned into a TV series for Peacock, with Joshua Jackson (The Affair) playing Duntsch. Although the podcast\u2019s first season ran just seven episodes, it left a striking impression: It was all I and most other true crime buffs I knew could talk about for weeks. Because I\u2019m a true crime nerd and perhaps a bit of a masochist, I\u2019ve listened to many a jaw-dropping yarn about murder. But the structured narrative, Beil\u2019s way of incrementally revealing Duntsch\u2019s history, and the sheer monumental scale of this story\u2019s tragedies, audacities, and systemic failures made Dr. Death unlike any other series for me.  Beil takes you through a nightmare that unfolds at multiple levels. There\u2019s the actual gory surgical horror Duntsch inflicted \u2014 grueling and sometimes difficult even to listen to, with details about incisions and nerve damage and, um, screws that most people never, ever want to hear in any setting, let alone this one. She also charts Duntsch\u2019s unbelievable progress through Dallas\u2019s medical scene and all of the moments when he could, and should, have been held accountable for botched surgeries and malpractice, only to get pats on the back and his prior mishaps hand-waved away \u2014 all for the sake of convenience.  Above all, Beil focuses on Duntsch himself, with his confidence and his completely unwarranted arrogance about his own expertise. Dr. Death season one devotes much of its time to close-reading Duntsch\u2019s behavior and psychology. By straightforwardly walking us through his college exploits, his drug-fueled residency days, and his complicated relationship with women, Beil delivers an unforgettable portrait of an entitled misogynist who joined toxic masculinity with narcissism and spent years passing off both traits as charisma. For Dr. Death season two, Beil takes a different approach \u2014 and not one that entirely worked for me. It\u2019s a funny thing to realize that what I\u2019m missing most from a true crime series is what I usually complain about getting too much of: a closer look at the villain. But season one put its villain in the foreground with a vengeance, and that made all the difference. It\u2019s possible that I had set too high a bar for season two because of my love for season one, but the differences between the seasons are obvious. Season two of Dr. Death examines the equally horrific story of Dr. Farid Fata, a Lebanese American doctor who ran a renowned cancer clinic franchise in Michigan until whistleblowers who worked with him revealed that he\u2019d been wrongfully diagnosing patients with cancer. Apparently driven by greed, Fata had even put hundreds of his trusting patients on chemotherapy treatments they didn\u2019t need.  The scale of Fata\u2019s crimes is much bigger than Duntsch\u2019s: He conducted his malpractice with less oversight because he ran a private practice, and carried out his horrors over a longer period of time, all while his patients raved about him and he gained tremendous local acclaim as a caring and nurturing practitioner. His nurses and staff saw a different side of him, however. To them, Fata was the pinnacle of a megalomaniacal micromanager, a penny-pincher who deliberately eschewed established medical practice without ever being held accountable for it. Season two of Dr. Death also scales outward. Perhaps because Fata had so little professional oversight, Beil\u2019s reporting turns away from examining his psychology or the system that produced him and toward dramatizing the process of exposing his crimes. Instead of focusing on Fata as the perpetrator, season two spends more time on several people who reported him, ultimately building to the climactic moment of exposure: a full-fledged FBI raid on Fata\u2019s entire staff.  We do hear from a few of the victims and their families, and these are heart-wrenching tales of people duped by Fata\u2019s outward show of kindness and veneer of authority. But season two feels, overall, far more like a chase thriller than season one \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure a story about medical malpractice, especially one released during the pandemic, should feel this much like a thriller. To be fair, some critics had similar complaints about season one; the New Yorker noted that Wondery has made \u201clurid\u201d true crime part of its milieu with series like Dr. Death and the equally popular Dirty John, another short-form true crime thriller. But season one of Dr. Death is, to me, much different from the typical true crime podcast. In the way it chooses to drill down into its subject, it\u2019s closer to the stellar second season of In The Dark, which my colleague Emily VanDerWerff called \u201cprocess-oriented storytelling.\u201d  One of the stories from season one that people remember the most involves that of Jerry Summers, a lifelong friend of Duntsch\u2019s who entrusted him with what should have been routine neck surgery only to wake up paralyzed \u2014 permanently. That\u2019s the kind of nightmare scenario you can only understand if you know both sides of Duntsch: the sociopath he really was, and the upstanding model doctor people believed him to be.  Beil frames Duntsch within both contexts, letting a story of one sociopath become a much larger story about societal failure. Summers and the other victims fell prey to the medical institutions that hired Duntsch and let him continue practicing despite botched surgeries, but they also fell prey to the social systems that reward confident men for their confidence, their swagger, and their gumption \u2014 regardless of whether those traits are earned.  I\u2018ve written about this tendency before \u2014 specifically, how true crime narratives perpetuate this mystique of the confident man rather than working to demystify it. The mythos of serial killer Ted Bundy continues to be one of the best examples of this, but other recent examples have sprung up, too.  The recent Netflix documentary American Murder worked hard to demystify family annihilator Chris Watts, who friends described as the perfect husband, and who was so popular he received a deluge of fan mail after he was imprisoned for murdering his wife and two young daughters. Even Duntsch was originally slated to be played on the Peacock show by the hunky Jamie Dornan, of Fifty Shades of Grey \u2014 a glamorous casting for an unglamorous guy who reportedly used to do his medical rounds while still high after all-nighters doing cocaine and LSD. Dr. Death\u2019s portrait of Duntsch works because Beil never stops reminding you how ordinary Duntsch\u2019s brand of arrogant incompetence is, nor of the systems that allowed him to flourish. She and her team of reporters hammer away at specific institutions for answers, especially Baylor, where Duntsch first received his surgical privileges.  By contrast, season two hardly teaches us about Fata himself, his training, and the institutions that failed to check him. One whistleblower carefully filed a report against Fata to her medical licensing organization through the internet, yet we learn nothing about the process by which that claim was investigated and ultimately closed \u2014 not even whether the organization that failed to act against Fata was subsequently investigated, or whether the claim was ever even seen by a pair of human eyes.  There\u2019s a world of difference in the broad overview beats of season one and the relentless drill-down of season two. Season two\u2019s \u201cDr. Death\u201d comes off as a disturbingly distant caricature, as opposed to the uncomfortable close-up we\u2019re forced to endure of Duntsch. The racial implications here are uncomfortable as well; that the podcast makes so little effort to unpack the psyche of a man who ultimately pleaded guilty to knowingly misdiagnosing or mistreating 553 patients seems to be a fraught choice.  Instead, season two focuses on the moral quandaries faced by whistleblowers. Yet season one also had its whistleblowers, a pair of Dallas surgeons who teamed up to stop Duntsch after realizing no one else would. Their ethical dilemmas have stuck with me, feeling weightier because we glimpse so much of the complicated world of high-powered Dallas medical politics that they\u2019re navigating. It\u2019s easy to see why the second season\u2019s creative team might have chosen, in this time of the pandemic, to place the emphasis on regular people taking accountability and taking risks to ensure medical safety. Beil even says as much in her final season two wrap-up interview.  But ironically, the disastrous way many authorities have dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic in the US \u2014 with a combination of hubris, arrogance, unearned confidence, and a lack of accountability for their decision-making \u2014 makes me value even more the lessons season one tried to teach us. These earlier episodes now seem almost like a pandemic playbook \u2014 a way of understanding systems of incompetence and how they sometimes manifest in unthinkable ways. ",

    "article_text": "How quickly can the US distribute a Covid-19 vaccine? Here are the four biggest logistical challenges. The first shipments of Covid-19 vaccines could be just days away, as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots await regulatory approval. Within 24 hours of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s go-ahead, either of these vaccines could begin shipping throughout the US in weeks, if not days. The vaccines\u2019 successful journey from the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 manufacturers to Americans\u2019 immune systems will require more than just the vaccine itself. The inoculation of more than 300 million people in the United States will require everything from glass vials to syringes to sophisticated cooling systems. But since this summer, there has been fear that the production of these supplies won\u2019t have ramped up enough by the time a viable vaccine is ready for distribution.  These worries aren\u2019t unfounded. The early months of the pandemic saw strained supply chains and a slew of shortages. There was a massive manufacturing effort to boost the number of ventilators, and a logistical gridlock over personal protective equipment like N-95 masks. Testing has been delayed in recent months because there aren\u2019t enough chemical reagents.  Now, the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines brings with it a whole new round of supply chain worries. The groups that represent the links in the supply chain for vaccine production \u2014 drug companies, pharmaceutical supplies manufacturers, government agencies \u2014 have had months to prepare. Their overall attitude seems to be one of cautious confidence. Many of these companies say they\u2019ve produced enough of the materials needed for the beginning of a mass vaccination campaign.  But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll have enough in the future. Some initial projects for vaccine production are already being reduced due to delays in securing enough raw material: Pfizer announced it will ship only half the vaccine supply it planned to distribute this year, though it expects to still make a billion doses available next year. Meanwhile, the hardware components are coming together. Production of freezer systems to distribute vaccines is ramping up, and companies that produce pharmaceutical glass for vials have spent the summer preparing their production lines. The US government has also brought on the medical supply company McKesson to assemble handy vaccination kits filled with materials like syringes and needles.  Suppliers and experts told Recode that while distributing Covid-19 vaccines will take a significant amount of coordination, we shouldn\u2019t expect widespread shortages of any needed materials \u2014 if everything goes as planned. The vaccines from both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two shots given weeks apart, which is certain to make the logistics even more complicated. And underlying the whole effort is a fear of waste and the idea that precious vaccine doses could go bad due to logistical failures.  \u201cThe most important question that countries have to ask themselves is where will this go wrong?\u201d said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo at the International Air Transport Association. \u201cIf it goes wrong, and a vaccine is effectively no longer usable, that\u2019s potentially a life that\u2019s at stake.\u201d Then there\u2019s the question of how willing to take a vaccine Americans will be. A November Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans would get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 50 percent in September. If enough people are willing to get inoculated and health care facilities have enough supplies and coordination to inoculate them, the effective end of the pandemic in the US could be months away, not years.  The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely be the first to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and Moderna is expected to be next. While Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be kept in a regular refrigerator for up to a month, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, a fact that creates some major challenges for distribution. For shipping and short-term storage, Pfizer has built packaging equipped with a cooling system that can keep the vaccine cold for up to 30 days if it\u2019s refilled with dry ice every five days. This system also includes a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of the shipment. The Pfizer vaccine can also be stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers for up to six months.  Companies that supply such freezers have been working hard to meet the surge in demand. While many hospitals already have ultra-cold freezers, they\u2019re typically used for other medical purposes, which means that hospitals need more. \u201cRight now, we are out of everything,\u201d an executive of So-Low Environmental Equipment, one of the makers of these freezers, told CNBC in November.  Alex Esmon of Thermo Fisher Scientific, which also makes ultra-low-temperature freezers, told Recode that the company started preparing for a surge in demand earlier this year and that orders have grown at least two-fold since then. He points out that thousands of doses can be stored in a relatively small freezer, which means that health care facilities can calibrate what cooling supplies they need based on how many people they expect to inoculate in a given time period. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily require a huge build-out,\u201d Esmon explained. \u201cIt requires the right build-out based on what each clinic and hospital system determines is going to be their need.\u201d  And then there\u2019s the need for dry ice, both for Pfizer\u2019s custom vaccine packaging and for other types of freezers that rely on the material. Dry ice companies have expressed some caution about the supply of carbon dioxide that they rely on, as there was a shortage of the compound earlier this year. While some of these providers say they\u2019re fine for now, they don\u2019t know what will happen once a vaccine receives authorization, but they anticipate a surge in demand.  \u201cRight now we have a great supply chain of CO2, which is beautiful for us because we haven\u2019t let down any of our customers in the last six months,\u201d Marc Savenor, the CEO of the company Acme Dry Ice, told Recode. He added that his company is already hearing from transportation and pharmaceutics companies for advance orders.  Still, the unique temperature needs of the Pfizer vaccine necessitates some thinking ahead from facilities that will distribute it. The cooling requirements could make it harder to distribute in rural areas, and even some hospitals don\u2019t yet have enough infrastructure to keep it cold.  Those planning to distribute the Pfizer vaccine have to decide between investing in ultra-low-temperature freezers, or buying lots and lots of dry ice, according to Jessica Daley, a supply chain expert at the health care supplier Premier. And as health care facilities consider the requirements of the first vaccine available, there are likely others down the line that will have different needs.  Anticipation of a vaccine has also boosted demand for pharmaceutical glass to make vials that will hold and protect doses while they\u2019re being transported and stored. Vials are important because they allow for the shipment of multiple shots of a vaccine in the same container. These vials can\u2019t be too big, because once they\u2019re opened, the vaccine inside can spoil quickly. So we need a lot of vials.  Over the summer, there was enough concern about a shortage of vials that the German company Schott, the world\u2019s largest producer of pharmaceutical glass, denied requests from drugmakers to reserve its borosilicate glass in advance. (Borosilicate is a type of glass that can protect the vaccine from contamination \u2014 like tiny glass particles \u2014 and high temperatures.) Schott says it made three out of every four glass vials used in all three stages of vaccine trials, and in preparation for a vaccine, the company aims to produce enough vials for 2 billion vaccinations. The Italian firm Stevanato Group, which also aims to produce enough glass for 2 billion doses, and the German company Gerrescheimer, have also committed to supplying pharmaceutical glass for vaccine containers. US companies are also producing alternatives as protection against bottlenecks. For several years, the New York-based glass manufacturer Corning has been working on a novel type of pharmaceutical glass, but the pandemic has given the novel material new promise. Valor Glass is supposed to be stronger than borosilicate glass, and less likely to produce cracks that can affect the sterility of a vaccine dose. (Corning also produces borosilicate glass tubing as well as Gorilla Glass, which is used for smartphone screens.)  In June, Corning received a $200 million contract from the US government to expand production of Valor Glass. The company now plans to produce an extra 164 million vials annually by the end of 2021, which would be 10 times what it produced before the pandemic, according to Brendan Mosher, the vice president and general manager of Corning\u2019s pharmaceutical glass business.  Another alternative is from SiO2 Materials Science, which makes medical-grade containers out of plastic that have a very thin coating of pure silica, the primary ingredient in most glass. The material can withstand incredibly cold temperatures, is lighter than traditional glass, and is less likely to break, SiO2\u2019s chief business officer Lawrence Ganti told Recode. These high-tech vials are already being used by Moderna and other companies that make Covid-19 treatments. A $143 million contract with the federal government helped SiO2 Materials Science add hundreds more employees, and Ganti says the company will be producing vials for about 200 million doses every month by 2021. When vials full of doses are delivered to and unpackaged at their facilities, health care workers will use needles and syringes to remove the dose from the container and inject the vaccine into patients. Across the US and the world, this will require an incredible number of syringes and needles.  Over the summer, Trump administration trade and manufacturing policy director Peter Navarro warned that it could take up to two years to manufacture enough syringes and needles to distribute a coronavirus vaccine nationwide. In a whistleblower complaint,  vaccine expert Rick Bright also warned that the Strategic National Stockpile only had 15 million syringes and later urged members of Congress to boost the government\u2019s supply. The country, the experts said, would need hundreds of millions of needles. The government has ramped up the production of syringes and needles in the intervening months. The Department of Defense has spent $100 million to secure more syringes and safety needles in a deal meant to provide over 500 million safety syringes within a year to the Strategic National Stockpile. The federal government also loaned nearly $600 million to a Connecticut-based company called ApiJect, which produces pre-filled syringes that serve as an alternative to the standard methods of injection. This particular device hasn\u2019t been used before \u2014 a fact that has prompted some confusion and concern, especially since the device has yet to be approved by the FDA. Meanwhile, health care supplier McKesson has been charged by the federal government with assembling vaccine kits, which include needles and syringes, for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on behalf of the Strategic National Stockpile. The government is also working with Becton, Dickinson, and Company, also known as BD, which is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of syringes and needles. BD aims to supply the government with 286 million syringes by early spring, many of which will be sent to McKesson to be included in the US supply of vaccine kits.  \u201cThis is a wonderful solution for providers because all of those little things that, like you said, you don\u2019t often think about \u2014 the alcohol wipes, the Band-Aids, the syringes, the needles \u2014 those things will be provided in those kits,\u201d Daley, the supply chain expert at Premier, told Recode, adding that they don\u2019t anticipate a shortage of syringes.  Still, BD has also warned buyers not to stockpile or buy more than they need, and that health care providers planning to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine should not order injection devices on their own. But the company\u2019s senior vice president for public affairs, Elizabeth Woody, expressed confidence in the plans, saying that the company felt prepared for the pandemic in part because of its experience with the H1N1 outbreak.  \u201cWe got a flavor of what might be required at a time like this,\u201d Woody told Recode. \u201cSince the start of the Covid pandemic, we\u2019ve been working around the clock, discussing our needs with governments across the globe, and really running our needle and syringe production lines 24/7.\u201d  Taking all of the needed materials into account \u2014 freezers, glass vials, syringes, needles \u2014 there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety around making sure that the vaccine ends up in the right place at the right time. No one wants vaccine doses to go to waste.  While Pfizer will distribute its own vaccine, McKesson will handle the distribution of the vaccine from Moderna once it\u2019s approved. But there are other key players that are preparing for their role in vaccine distribution. Airlines are bracing to start moving the vaccine, even turning to passenger planes that have been grounded by low demand during the pandemic. Shippers like FedEx, UPS, and DHL are all preparing for deliveries, and some are boosting freezer storage while also balancing the demands of holiday season online shopping. Once the vaccine arrives, there\u2019s another hurdle before injection. Depending on their area and resources, local health facilities could vary widely in their ability to get vaccines to patients.  \u201cMy concern is there may not be enough storage capacity or staff to be able to vaccinate at the desired rate,\u201d Northwestern professor Hani Mahmassani told Recode. \u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of little things that can go wrong at that level, and you may not have the health care infrastructure to deliver.\u201d The second dose also presents unique challenges: Vaccine distributors injecting patients with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine need to be meticulous about which patients receive which vaccine, and keep track of who needs a booster shot just a few weeks later. Meditech, one prominent provider of electronic health records in the US, is working on providing a certificate to patients as they receive the first and second dose, for instance. US health officials have also said that people who get vaccinated will receive \u201cvaccine cards,\u201d harking back to the idea of immunity passports discussed earlier this year.  But that means that even if all the supply chains for delivering vaccines and supplies hold up, the greatest challenge will still be logistical: getting the right people to show up and receive the vaccine \u2014 and a necessary booster \u2014 at the right time. For health care facilities, that will mean a high level of coordination and meticulous tracking. There\u2019s understandable fear that that might be a far-fetched goal, too. Nearly a year into the pandemic, Covid-19 testing is still crippled by long lines, delays, and confusion.  Even if the supply chain holds and the distribution of the vaccine goes off without a hitch, the public has to be willing to take the vaccine and get their booster shots in the right time frame. Large numbers of people need to be inoculated for the US population to reach herd immunity. \u201cIf only 40 percent of the population gets vaccinated, this thing will not disappear,\u201d said Hughes, the air cargo expert at IATA. Otherwise, he added, the vaccine is \u201ca bit like a fire break when you have a wildfire.\u201d It might slow the spread, but it won\u2019t save the forest.

    "article_text": "How Melbourne eradicated Covid-19 In July and August, the Australian state of Victoria was going through a second Covid-19 wave. Local leaders set an improbable goal in the face of that challenge. They didn\u2019t want to just get their Covid-19 numbers down. They wanted to eliminate the virus entirely. By the end of November, they\u2019d done it. They have seen no active cases for a full four weeks. Melbourne, the state\u2019s capital and a city with about as many people as the greater Washington, DC, area, is now completely coronavirus-free. Australia enjoyed plenty of advantages over the United States in containing Covid-19. It has no land borders to speak of. Its population density is very low (though the population is concentrated on the coasts). Its outbreak never got nearly as bad as the US\u2019s did. On its worst days, Victoria saw about 700 new cases; Missouri, with (very roughly) a similar population and landmass, is currently averaging more than 3,000. Some of the Australian states also closed their borders to the others, which lowered the risk somebody might bring Covid-19 from one part of the country to another. But the Australian epidemic has also mirrored America\u2019s in important ways. Once the coronavirus arrived in the spring, the country went into lockdown. When cases abated, some of those restrictions were eased \u2014 and, before too long, Covid-19 cases were spiking again. Each state was responsible for its own response, with the federal government playing an advisory role outside of obviously national issues like foreign travel.  In the second wave, Victoria was by far the hardest-hit state. Its case numbers were dwarfing those in every other state including New South Wales, home to the country\u2019s other great metropolis, Sydney. Policymakers dreaded an endless cycle of lockdown-reopening-lockdown \u2014 exactly the situation the US finds itself in. They realized that amorphous goals of \u201cslowing the spread\u201d or \u201cflattening the curve\u201d had been ineffective in mustering public support for the stringent mitigation measures that would be necessary to contain the virus. So they went big. The state\u2019s roadmap largely followed a policy proposal laid out in September by the Grattan Institute (a nonprofit think tank supported by the state and federal governments): \u201cGo for zero.\u201d  The goal was not just to slow Covid-19 down. It was to eradicate the virus. The state had gone into a stage 4 lockdown \u2014 most businesses closed, there was a nightly curfew, and residents were ordered to stay within five kilometers of their home \u2014 in August, and it was then extended in September, with the explicit goal of eventually reaching zero new cases. \u201cIdeally, lockdowns are only done once and done well,\u201d the proposal\u2019s authors, Stephen Duckett and Will Mackey, explained. \u201cThe benefit of zero is to reduce the risk of \u2018yo-yoing\u2019 between virus flare-ups and further lockdowns to contain them.\u201d They treated the threats to public health and the economy as intertwined, which most experts agree they are. The Australian states that contained Covid-19 best also saw the strongest economic recoveries. Victoria, with the worst outbreak among the states, was lagging behind in consumer spending and business revenue.  People will stay home and spend less if they are worried about the virus. The Grattan authors cited a study comparing Denmark (which established a lockdown) and Sweden (which took a more relaxed \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy) and found that their economies suffered about the same in the early months of the pandemic. But later in the year, when Denmark had its outbreak under control but Sweden did not, unemployment claims were almost back to pre-Covid levels in the former but remained elevated in the latter. \u201cWithout elimination, the third, fourth, or fifth wave is an inevitability. This will either involve more lockdowns or the government will lose the social license to do lockdowns and the virus will spread indiscriminately,\u201d Duckett told me over email, perhaps unwittingly describing the very challenge before the United States during this winter surge. \u201cA hard lockdown in the early stages of the virus gives a chance for elimination, and that gives the chance for business certainty and a full recovery.\u201d Melburnians are now enjoying the benefits of their sacrifices. Duckett said he had just gone to lunch with a few friends before responding to my email.  The US probably cannot achieve zero Covid-19 cases anytime soon. But it could embrace the spirit of the Victorian model: a clear goal, support for the proven mitigation strategies, and a commitment from the public.  \u201cHaving a clear, uniform goal \u2014 that everyone could work toward \u2014 was critical to Victoria\u2019s success,\u201d Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t just have a goal. They established the underlying components that were needed and provided strong social support.\u201d \u201cAll of this,\u201d she continued, \u201chas been mostly absent in America.\u201d There was nothing particularly novel about Victoria\u2019s containment strategy. They just dedicated themselves to what works. They expanded testing, including random pooled testing and testing for workers in essential industries and of people attending schools or other indoor events. They achieved 24-hour turnarounds for test results, so if a person tested positive, they could quickly isolate. Once cases reached zero, the state was planning to start testing sewage for Covid-19 to get a head start on any resurgence. The Grattan Institute also recommended ramping up contact tracing, another established part of an effective Covid-19 response, and mandatory isolation. Australia had problems earlier in the year with international travelers breaking their quarantines and introducing the virus into the community. The experts advised having people scan QR codes if they entered any public venues, so they could be contacted if a related case was detected. They also noted that other Australian states had police do spot checks of people who were supposed to be in isolation. \u201cA system that relies on self-isolation in which people are unable or refuse to self-isolate cannot succeed,\u201d Duckett and Mackey wrote. That probably sounds draconian to Americans. Certainly, the harshest lockdown measures taken in Victoria \u2014 requiring people to stay within a few miles of their house and stay inside completely at night \u2014 would be politically challenging in the US. But Australians took it in stride because they knew the goal they were working toward. \u201cI think being obedient is definitely part of the Australian psyche,\u201d Eloise Shepherd, who lives in the Melbourne suburbs (and whom I met for our feature on Australian health care published earlier this year), told me over text. \u201cIt was really hard, but I\u2019m so grateful we did it.\u201d The government there made it easier for businesses and workers by providing subsidies to businesses to keep people employed and by increasing their unemployment benefits \u2014 the same policies that the US has let lapse and is now struggling to reinstitute even during this devastating winter wave. As cases dwindled, the lockdown measures were relaxed in a clear, tiered fashion. The extreme travel restrictions were the first to go. Schools and businesses could reopen with spacing. Masks continued to be required indoors and on public transportation. Eventually, all restrictions except for international quarantine could be lifted. Things could still go wrong for Victoria and the rest of Australia. The state has started prioritizing having \u201cnormal\u201d conditions for the Christmas shopping season over maintaining zero new cases. But it is easier to focus on reopening when community spread is eliminated \u2014 rather than pushing forward with reopening in spite of sustained spread, as the US has done. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re going to basically have a much easier life now that the pandemic is under control,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cWe still celebrate the fact that we\u2019ve had so many days with no new infections and no deaths. The community is very proud of itself.\u201d Victoria\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions were controversial with some residents, but Australia in general enjoys more political homogeny than the US does. That must make it easier to build solidarity for these extraordinary measures. America is deeply polarized, and that has been reflected in our scattered policy responses and in the differing attitudes of Democrats and Republicans toward mask-wearing and other restrictions. But I don\u2019t believe it was impossible for America to execute a similar strategy to the one that has succeeded in Victoria. Polls showed most Americans did support wearing masks and other mitigation measures, even if there was some divide among partisans. They worried that social distancing would be relaxed too quickly, not too slowly, much like the Australians did. The problem, or one of them, is that the US just never set a clear goal for Covid-19 suppression. It was understandably hard to ask people in Wisconsin to abide by social distancing restrictions back when they thought the coronavirus was just a New York City problem \u2014 and when they didn\u2019t know what the plan was. Today, of course, the pandemic is a very real problem for every American. So as we try to bring the winter wave under control, we might benefit from taking a lesson from the Aussies and coming up with a specific objective that all of us, together, can work toward.",

    "article_text": "The death of the department store and the American middle class In a New Jersey suburb seven miles west of Midtown Manhattan, the American Dream is on shaky ground. The Dream in question isn\u2019t the mythological notion that upward social mobility is within reach for all hardworking Americans. It\u2019s a $5 billion, 3 million-square-foot shopping and entertainment complex in East Rutherford featuring an indoor ski slope, an ice-skating rink, and a Nickelodeon-branded amusement park. The complex finally opened last fall, but it\u2019s now facing huge new challenges. The development\u2019s complicated 17-year history, marked by ownership changes, false starts, and broken promises, had already put American Dream in a precarious situation. The Covid-19 pandemic hitting in March made things much worse. Whether the mall makes it in the long term will hinge in part on how it deals with the collapse of three of the marquee department stores that were to anchor the complex and draw foot traffic \u2014 Barneys New York, Lord & Taylor, and Century 21 \u2014 which all have gone bankrupt and closed, or are planning to close all their stores in the US.  Around 100 storefronts in American Dream opened their doors to customers in October and November, but the complex\u2019s future is not guaranteed. Its owners, Triple Five Group, missed several mortgage payments this summer, and it\u2019s not clear who might fill the enormous holes left by the three fallen department store chains, or which other retail tenants will opt out of their leases now that the development is missing three of its anchors.  While the story of American Dream is unique in many ways, its struggles are emblematic of the bleak future facing many US malls and department stores \u2014 whose destinies have long been intertwined. The downfall of these onetime crown jewels of retail will have meaningful impacts on the Americans who work for them and the communities they\u2019ve long called home.  Across the US, department stores are shrinking or shuttering altogether. In 2011, US department stores employed 1.2 million employees across 8,600 stores, according to estimates from the research firm IBISWorld. But in 2020, there are now fewer than 700,000 employees in the sector, working across just over 6,000 locations.  The reasons for the struggles are both shared and unique. Since the Great Recession began in late 2007, the vast majority of income growth in the US has gone to high-income households, squeezing middle-class households and altering where they spend money. As a result, chains that sell brands at sharp discounts like TJ Maxx, Ross, and Dollar General have become more popular, siphoning away shoppers from full-price department stores like Macy\u2019s and J.C. Penney that were designed to cater to a stronger middle class of yesteryear. Department stores are also facing the reality that they are no longer the main way most shoppers discover or access new brands \u2014 which was once perhaps their main appeal as onetime innovators. Consumer brands have increasingly become focused on building connections with customers through their own stores, websites, social media platforms, and other online-only marketplaces.  All the while, department stores\u2019 contraction is upending local labor markets and the communities they called home. And rock bottom is not even here yet. More than half of all mall-based department stores will close by the end of 2021, according to estimates by Green Street Advisors, a commercial property research firm. And that will have a massive impact on malls; as of January, department stores accounted for nearly one out of every three square feet in malls.  \u201cThe department store genre has been taking the great American shopping mall down with it, slowly but inevitably,\u201d said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia University who was previously the CEO of multiple department store chains in the US and Canada. What happens when an entire sector of retail, one that employs more than half a million people, is in free fall \u2014 and is slowing or dragging down shopping malls like American Dream with it? And what becomes of the local communities across the country whose social identities and local economies rested on, at least in part, now-fallen department stores and the malls they buttressed? We\u2019re about to find out. For much of the past century, US department store chains played an important role in many Americans\u2019 lives and an innovative role in the retail sector.  For the American middle class of the 20th century, department stores helped shape what successfully living the American dream looked like. These stores were often an entry point into fashion and home furnishing trends once reserved for only the wealthiest, since they offered large selections of name brands at affordable prices all under one roof \u2014 first in big cities, and then following population exoduses to the suburbs. And as the main attractions for malls in the suburban US, they played a foundational role in the idea of shopping as a social activity in the second half of the 20th century.  Department store employees also had it pretty good, for a time. The sector was welcoming to women salespeople, providing a path to certain corporate roles for those who found success, according to the book From Main Street to Mall: The Rise and Fall of the American Department Store. A successful salesperson working in one of these stores, especially before large chains came to dominate the sector, could make a career of their role, providing for their family, no college degree needed. Those days are mostly long gone. But over the past two decades, a confluence of other factors has placed several giants at death\u2019s door and put even the most innovative in a precarious situation. These factors were both external and internal: Amazon led a boom in online shopping, and many brands that once relied on department stores began selling directly to customers online and in their own stores. Meanwhile, many department store chains made the wrong bets, investing more heavily in store expansion while underinvesting in merchandise differentiation and e-commerce strategies.  But perhaps most critically for the chains targeting the middle class \u2014 think Macy\u2019s, J.C. Penney, and Bon-Ton \u2014 this category of households has been struggling since the Great Recession began in 2007. According to a 2018 study from the consulting firm Deloitte, \u201cthe middle 40 percent\u201d of the country saw its income shrink in the previous decade, while more than $8 out of every $10 in income growth nationwide went to high-income households. As a result, discount chains that sell name brands at a bargain \u2014 like TJ Maxx and Ross stores \u2014 became much more attractive to middle-class shoppers than department stores selling at full price. The treasure-hunting aspect of stores like TJ Maxx and Home Goods also added to their appeal over many of their department store competitors. Macy\u2019s, the largest traditional department store in the country, said earlier this year that it planned to close 125 of its 800-plus stores \u2014 and that was before the pandemic.  \u201cSears was built for [the] middle-class mall goer,\u201d Web Smith, the founder of the commerce and media newsletter 2PM, wrote in the wake of Sears\u2019s 2018 bankruptcy. \u201cIt\u2019s been the thesis of 2PM, Inc. that retailers who\u2019ve built their businesses for this American demo will continue to struggle until the American middle class rebounds.\u201d But department stores catering to wealthier customers have failed, too. In addition to Sears and J.C. Penney, higher-end stores Barneys New York, Lord & Taylor, and Neiman Marcus have all filed for bankruptcy in the past two years. Even Nordstrom, viewed by industry insiders as the most progressive traditional department store chain, is facing significant headwinds. While overall US e-commerce sales increased 45 percent year over year from April to June as pandemic shutdowns pushed more shoppers online, Nordstrom registered just 20 percent growth in online sales. As more Americans came online and as social media platforms rose in popularity, brands started establishing direct relationships online and through their own stores, which chipped away at their reliance on department stores for finding customers. For a while, department stores still could provide a way to reach mostly older consumers who preferred in-person shopping or others who didn\u2019t have internet access, but the chains became more complementary for popular brands rather than remaining a crucial sales channel.  More mid-priced brands such as Levi\u2019s and Adidas started selling on Amazon and other online marketplaces as department stores targeting the middle class began to struggle, meaning chains like Macy\u2019s now had serious online competition, too. And since Amazon and other top online retailers are in many cases more convenient than visiting a large store where salespeople are trained and paid less than they once were, department store advantages further diminished. Finally, some private equity companies \u2014 investment firms that buy up struggling companies in part by saddling them with debt \u2014 have taken aim at the sector, and the debt associated with their takeovers has hastened the demise of some department store chains like Neiman Marcus. The Dallas-based luxury chain filed for bankruptcy earlier this year under crushing debt from its PE owner.  The chain was also late to e-commerce \u2014 when it finally started getting aggressive around 2014, introducing free shipping and returns to better compete with Nordstrom, it didn\u2019t work and instead crimped its profits. The company\u2019s bottom line was also hurt by some of the biggest brands it sells moving from a wholesale model to a more flexible and lower-risk model that was less profitable for Neiman Marcus. While a private equity owner didn\u2019t force these moves, the fallout from these crises coupled with a heavy debt burden was a recipe for disaster. While the pandemic has accelerated contraction of the department store industry, the sector has been in a slow descent for decades. And the communities they call home, which experienced the upside of their presence during the golden years, are now faced with a series of cascading challenges. \u201cFirst they become an eyesore; it\u2019s aesthetically damaging,\u201d said Vicki Howard, the author of From Main Street to Mall. \u201cSecond, there\u2019s the jobs. \u2026 Third, it impacts the consumers themselves that have turned to that area for leisure activities, for places to go in the winter, to go with their kids.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big economic and social and cultural phenomenon to have these department stores closing \u2014 and malls also,\u201d she added. \u201cThey occupy such a physical place as well as a social space.\u201d The decline of department stores and the malls they supported has required local governments to get creative. In Bartlesville, Oklahoma, a city of 36,000 near the border of Kansas, local officials have embraced discount chains as the local Washington Park Mall has struggled. The city provided $1.5 million in incentives in 2016 to develop an outdoor shopping center with popular discount retailers TJ Maxx and Ross to help offset the longtime troubles of the mall, once anchored by the department stores Sears, J.C. Penney, and Dillard\u2019s. (Sears and J.C. Penney both closed their stores there in recent years, and Dillard\u2019s recently turned its mall location into a clearance store.)  \u201cWe\u2019ve been exceedingly fortunate to have replaced the mall\u2019s legacy brands with up-and-coming brands better aligned with today\u2019s consumer preferences,\u201d David Wood, Bartlesville\u2019s economic development chief, told Recode in an email. The city also provided a $200,000 incentive to divide an old Kmart into five smaller retail establishments, including outlet stores Ollie\u2019s and Burkes Outlet, as well as a Dollar Tree store. The new retail additions, Wood added, \u201chave largely offset the employment loss \u2014 with rising sales tax collections, too.\u201d Taxable physical retail sales dropped in 2015 and 2016 in Bartlesville but grew modestly in 2018 and 2019. Of course, department store jobs are different from discount chain jobs, which have lower average hourly pay and rarely offer sales commissions.  In Madison, Wisconsin, local city-planning officials are looking ahead to a possible future where their city won\u2019t have malls anchored by department stores. They have been discussing potential redevelopment plans for the areas around the community\u2019s struggling East Towne Mall and West Towne Mall since 2018, and the discussions took on added significance when the malls\u2019 owner filed for bankruptcy in early November.  Several of the malls\u2019 anchor tenants have closed up shop in the past few years, including the department store chains Boston Store and Sears. While the Madison economy is diverse outside of retail, with a large research university and state government offices calling the city home, city planners believe it is critical to start discussing potential redevelopment plans, whether or not the mall\u2019s owner ends up selling or gets on board with redevelopment, because by the time large commercial properties are in true distress, the ripple effects can be dangerous. \u201cLonger-term vacancies can sometimes snowball and have the effect of spreading and negatively impacting surrounding areas,\u201d said Ben Zeller, a city planner for Madison. Madison officials have been studying other mall redevelopment plans around the country for ideas about what to do. If redevelopment of these Madison malls does end up happening and looks anything like projects in other communities that city planners are studying, the retail presence would likely be downsized and supplemented by new residential buildings and non-retail employers. Zeller himself lives in an apartment building built on a former mall parking lot in another part of Madison. At a high level, Zeller told Recode that such redevelopment plans are complex, which means they take time: 15 to 20 years or longer to complete. One challenge involves the fragmented ownership structure of large mall properties, where the main mall may be owned by one business and the department store anchors and restaurants could be owned by separate entities. Another challenge involves restructuring the public street network around malls. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to have a future neighborhood created when there are blocks [in existing mall developments] that are 100 to 200 acres as opposed to a normal city block,\u201d he added. Residential neighborhoods typically need shorter street connections to make public transportation and walking viable. Zeller added that the city wants to make sure that, no matter who buys in, \u201cwe ultimately end up with a connected public street network, adequate parkland to serve new residential uses, integrated transit, an improved bike network, and other components of complete neighborhoods.\u201d In short, communities can rebound from department store chain failures \u2014 and the ripple effect on malls \u2014 if they have the time and resources to plan two decades into the future like Madison is starting to. But not every American community does.  While some of the evolution that the department store sector has gone through marked natural generational shifts in consumer behavior, the industry\u2019s failures have had a significant impact for those who work in retail, extinguishing the idea of retail sales positions as careers \u2014 which in the 20th century was an advantage for department stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a negative cycle. If you have less career-oriented employees and higher turnover, you invest less in those employees,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, the chief commerce strategy officer at the global advertising holding company Publicis. \u201cIt creates this vicious cycle and then you can\u2019t recruit good employees. They were turned from advisers and very relationship-based salespeople into cashiers.\u201d With few exceptions, the idea of a department store sales job being a career hasn\u2019t been a reality for decades. In the mid-1900s, they could be steady, family-supporting jobs with fixed schedules. But in the decades following the birth of big-box retailers Walmart, Kmart, and Target \u2014 all in 1962 \u2014 retail wages began dropping as traditional chains chased the lower-paying labor models of the new discount retailers.  \u201cI would have to guess that by 1980 it was not likely that a single-wage earner could support a family while working on the selling floor of a retail store,\u201d said Cohen, the Columbia professor and former department store executive. Yes, there are still top salespeople at chains like Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus who might pull in six figures, but they are the few exceptions to the rule. So where are department store employees going as their employers cut jobs, close stores, or go bankrupt? In the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, more started working in discount chains. The category of the retail industry that includes dollar stores like Dollar General jumped into the top five categories of employment that attracted workers who had recently left or were laid off from a department store job. (This job transition data was based on a Brookings Institution analysis of current population survey public-use microdata provided to Recode by Chad Shearer, a former senior research associate at the think tank who is now an economic development consultant.) That may not be a great thing, as least as it relates to employee earnings. While Dollar General\u2019s stock price has nearly tripled over the past five years, its front-line employees don\u2019t see much of that enrichment. Average hourly base pay at Dollar General is $9, according to the job review site Glassdoor, compared to $11 at Macy\u2019s. The rise of e-commerce can be seen in this job movement data, too. During the same five-year period, if you combine the \u201celectronic shopping\u201d and \u201cwarehousing\u201d job sectors (which both include e-commerce companies) into one category of employment, the combined sector moves into the top 10 for industries where employees who had recently left department store roles went to work next. It\u2019s possible e-commerce employers should rank even higher in reality, since many e-commerce warehouse employees are technically hired by third-party temporary employment firms.  There are trade-offs to this shift. On the one hand, Amazon warehouse employees in the US make a base wage of $15 an hour, which is a higher base pay than most entry-level department store jobs. But the work is often much more physical in nature than a retail job, requiring workers to pick or stow hundreds of items per hour at a rapid pace and to be able to lift up to 50 pounds of goods. The reality is that when it comes to finding a job in 2020, Amazon and Walmart \u2014 already the two biggest private sector employers in the US \u2014 are the retailers offering work. While so many industries have contracted, they\u2019ve added hundreds of thousands of new job openings this year alone. And as department stores continue to cut jobs, the largest players in the new retail economy capture more power in the labor market. There is no silver bullet for US department stores to immediately start thriving again, so the best many can do is simply try to adapt and survive. For chains that still have a nationwide presence \u2014 like Macy\u2019s or Nordstrom \u2014 that means fewer large, full-price stores and more investment in e-commerce sales, potentially supplemented by smaller pickup points for online orders to offset expensive shipping costs. Macy\u2019s executives have also said the company plans to test smaller stores that aren\u2019t attached to malls in an effort to unhitch their destiny from struggling regional malls built for a weakening American middle class. As these chains fight their uphill battles, they are being replaced by a bevy of options that can provide better prices, selection, or convenience to shoppers of all wealth levels. The best discount chains, for example, are still thriving a decade after the Great Recession ended. Even without a strong e-commerce presence, the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods is moving steadily through the pandemic, with a stock price equal to what it was before Covid-19 hit the US in March. And Dollar General\u2019s stock price hit an all-time high in October; the company is now worth nearly $53 billion. Brands that sell apparel and cosmetics \u2014 key product categories for many department store chains \u2014 continue to sell more goods directly to shoppers through their own stores and websites rather than through department store chains. This direct connection gives brands, whether they\u2019re established or new startups, more control over how their goods are displayed, more information about who their customers are, and often better profit margins. Nike, for example, stopped selling through department stores Belk and Dillard\u2019s earlier this year and is no longer available at the online retailer Zappos. Under Armour announced it would cut its wholesale partners in North America by 2,000 to 3,000 stores. New online retailers that attract digital-savvy consumers and, in turn, more brands \u2014 like Stitch Fix, Rent the Runway, The RealReal, and ThredUp \u2014 were also stealing market share from department stores pre-pandemic. But Amazon continues to be the titan of the modern retail world. It\u2019s at least seven times bigger than No. 2 Walmart in e-commerce, and it\u2019s continuing to invest in beefing up its physical store presence as well. While the online giant\u2019s direct impact on department stores was minimal for much of its history, things have changed in recent years. Amazon is still not a high-end fashion destination, but it is absolutely a place where a majority of Americans are willing to buy footwear, casual clothing, or basics like underwear and socks. In April, the retail research firm Coresight said that more than 70 percent of apparel shoppers bought clothing or footwear on Amazon in the prior 12 months \u2014 an increase of 10 percentage points from 2019 and 25 percentage points from 2018. At the weakest moment for department stores, Amazon is becoming a more powerful direct competitor. Taken together, the future for department stores is bleak, and for many of the malls they anchor. Yes, the US has too many retail stores \u2014 40 percent more retail square feet per person than No. 2 Canada \u2014 and too many subpar malls, considering current shopping trends. Yes, the retailers courting business away from department stores are providing superior products, prices, or experiences that are resonating better with shoppers. Yes, it is normal in capitalism for industry categories to fall while others rise.  But the communities across the country that depended on these stores and malls as job creators will have to get creative to rebuild around their ruins. And the Americans who once saw a department store sales job as a potential career, or at least an entry path to a better-paying retail corporate job, now face a new reality: Many of the biggest retailers hiring today \u2014 discount chains and e-commerce giants \u2014 are offering less pay, or perhaps better pay but less personable and more grueling work. Even if you could snap your fingers and return this retail sector to glory, it wouldn\u2019t solve the key societal and macroeconomic problems connected to its decline. While the median US household brought in 48 percent more income in 2018 than in 1970, the vast majority of those gains happened prior to 2000. Along the way, the middle class\u2019s income share \u2014 which many of the biggest department store chains catered to \u2014 has shrunk by 19 percentage points as the rich keep getting richer. In turn, most shoppers value discounts above all else; who can blame them? And for those who can afford it, the convenience of Amazon Prime delivery and its endless virtual shelves of merchandise is very difficult to beat. If the American dream of department stores wasn\u2019t fully extinguished before 2020, the year of the pandemic will make sure it is.",

    "article_text": "Conspiracy theories, explained    Eleanor\u2019s dad loved science \u2014 or so she thought. Eleanor grew up listening to stories of the Apollo missions and audio clips from space expeditions. Every weekend, the two of them hopped on a train to downtown Philadelphia to visit the Franklin Institute, where they would explore the planetarium, flight simulators, and technology exhibits.  \u201cIt was our special thing,\u201d Eleanor, now an elementary school teacher who requested that Vox not use her real name to protect her privacy, told me. That was several years ago. In 2020, Eleanor began to glimpse a much different version of her father.  \u201cI\u2019m going to a protest,\u201d he told her in April. At first, she assumed he was attending a Black Lives Matter march or a similar event. But no \u2014 her father was protesting to reopen the state of Pennsylvania, then under lockdown due to Covid-19, because he thought the governor was exaggerating the threat of the virus. Other dissonant moments followed. Eleanor\u2019s father didn\u2019t just disagree with Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf \u2014 suddenly, Wolf was \u201ca dictator.\u201d Her father started following fringe communities and groups online, arguing that masks were \u201ca muzzle and a control device,\u201d a way for the government to somehow manipulate the populace. Then he began enthusiastically repeating the false claims of Stella Immanuel, a Houston pediatrician who went viral earlier this year for claiming hydroxychloroquine could \u201ccure\u201d Covid-19. (Immanuel has also declared, among other things, that ovarian cysts are caused by sex with demons, that scientists are experimenting with alien DNA, and that reptilian humanoids are running the government.) Once, when Immanuel appeared on a TV news segment, Eleanor\u2019s father and stepmother began cheering, as though they were at a political rally instead of at home watching a far-right conspiracy theorist. \u201cI genuinely thought, \u2018Is this early-onset dementia?\u2019\u201d Eleanor told me. \u201cIt seemed so out of character.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s story of a family member\u2019s surprising, sudden embrace of conspiracy theories echoes countless others that have emerged in recent years, hand in hand with America\u2019s ever more divergent ideological spectrum. The era of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency alone has seen numerous unfounded conspiracy theories enter the mainstream, from increasing numbers of anti-vaxxers fueling measles outbreaks to Pizzagate \u2014 the conspiracy theory that emerged shortly before the 2016 election and alleged that politicians were running a child-trafficking ring \u2014 to numerous Covid-19 hoaxes. There\u2019s no hard evidence that conspiracy theories are circulating more widely today than ever before. But over the past five years, it has certainly seemed like average Americans have bought into them more and more. Surveys within the past year have shown that a quarter of US citizens believe the mainstream media is lying to them about Covid-19, and that it is \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably true\u201d that the outbreak was intentionally planned.  Meanwhile, the headline-grabbing QAnon, a conspiracy theory that evolved from Pizzagate and posits that Trump has been working in secret to capture high-powered figures who are engaged in child abduction and trafficking, is still a niche belief. But a quarter of those who know what it is think there\u2019s at least some truth to it, and that number is growing rapidly as the QAnon theory begins to converge with Covid-19 theories.  As 2020 enters the home stretch, new conspiracy theories seem to keep coming up. The latest? Trump\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud during the presidential election, which many of his followers are echoing, despite zero evidence, in any state, to support the assertion. \u201cWe\u2019re nine months into the pandemic,\u201d said Ben Radford, a folklorist, psychologist, and fellow with the Center for Inquiry whose research interests include contemporary conspiracies and hoaxes. \u201cSome people are out of a job. There\u2019s lots of uncertainty. And some people will channel that uncertainty into conspiracy theories.\u201d  But how did we get to a place where previously science-minded and logic-loving dads can find conspiracy theories with ease, and where once-fringe paranoia is now embedded in our country\u2019s politics? Why did baseless theories about health, science, and sinister world leadership get to be so popular, and why now?  Let\u2019s walk through the factors leading to the current explosion of conspiracy theories \u2014 and what we can do to combat them.  The history of conspiracy theories is somewhat short, relative to human evolution. According to Radford, the first conspiracy theories as we might recognize them now likely didn\u2019t spring up until the mid-15th century, with the invention of the Gutenberg press in the 1440s. Movable type allowed for the wider spread of information \u2014 and anxious reinterpretation of that information. \u201cSuddenly you not only have knowledge that is reproducible, but you also have other people who are writing about things that may have a different perspective,\u201d Radford said. This was the moment, he argues, in which the first conflicts of information arose over what was true and what wasn\u2019t. Conspiracy theories have most often flourished during times of great sociopolitical upheaval and uncertainty. \u201cYou see this kind of boom in conspiracies whenever there\u2019s political or social unrest throughout history,\u201d Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist who researches conspiracies at the Social Decision-Making Lab at Cambridge, told me. \u201cWhenever there is significant uncertainty in the world.\u201d  Take the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, another transformative moment in conspiratorial thinking. These events were prompted by sweeping social and political changes in Puritan New England: frontier wars with American Indians, expanding roles for women, and challenges to religious authority.  The prevailing fear of Salem witch hunters wasn\u2019t that the woman next door might be a witch, but rather that a vast network of witches existed and were gathering in secret, plotting to do evil. This basic idea of a covert network of evildoers threads through most 20th-century moral panics, from the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories circulated by the Nazis to McCarthyism to the Satanic Panic of the 1980s and \u201990s.  Conspiracy theories provide people with a feeling of control when presented with troubling and disturbing information, calming our fears of the inevitable or unknown. \u201cA lot of these conspiracies detract from some scary themes in the world,\u201d van der Linden told me. \u201cClimate change, coronavirus. It\u2019s just another way to deny reality and having to think about your own fragility in the world. It\u2019s an escape for people who are not so tolerant of uncertainty.\u201d For people who want a sense of order, conspiracy theories may provide a belief framework \u2014 even if it\u2019s a negative one. \u201cIt tells people the world isn\u2019t just random,\u201d Radford said. \u201cThe world\u2019s going to hell, but there is some master plan. People take comfort in that, in a sort of perverse way.\u201d Troubling times further breed conspiracy theories on the principle of supply and demand: The circumstances from which they are born lead to their proliferation. But if conspiracy theories have historically gotten a boost from geopolitical turbulence, modern-day conspiracies have several other unprecedented factors working in their favor \u2014 starting with memes and misinformation. Conspiracy theories are often seen as akin to folklore or urban legends \u2014 as mostly harmless, \u201cwhat if\u201d entertainment. But in the United States, conspiracy theories have much more power than these tales do. The conspiracy theory can be a political weapon, thanks to what historian Richard J. Hofstadter called \u201cthe paranoid style\u201d: a tendency toward hyper-vigilant, alarmist, and absolutist beliefs that stem from a combination of \u201cheated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy.\u201d  This tendency, which Hofstadter thought belonged only to a small minority of people, now undergirds much of American politics. Once-obscure conspiratorial ideas are now habitually deployed by national leaders like Trump and members of his outgoing administration, specifically to create further political tension. \u201cTypically, folklore spreads without much intentional direction,\u201d Radford said. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating over the past few months and years is the weaponization of folklore and the weaponization of these sorts of legends in which you have, for example, Russian disinformation agencies.\u201d Social media facilitates the spread of information, giving rise to viral formats like memes. Conspiracy theories are memetic \u2014 they mutate easily and take on new forms \u2014 which makes them a perfect fit for social media platforms.  That\u2019s why blatantly absurd yet longstanding conspiracy tropes \u2014 such as the centuries-old fear that people in power are kidnapping children to drink their blood \u2014 can keep going and going and going: These tropes trigger moral outrage, prompting audiences to spread the story, which then keeps morphing into new forms like stories in a game of Telephone. For example, the \u201cdrinking the blood of children\u201d trope \u2014 used for centuries to justify oppression of Jewish people \u2014 has been applied QAnon\u2019s claim that high-powered Democrats are kidnapping kids to harvest their blood. Such ideas, no matter how far-fetched, can keep spreading indefinitely as they transform and reach vast new audiences.  It\u2019s not just social media that contributes to fearmongering and the spread of misinformation: Many controversial  figures spread conspiracy theories not because they believe in them and want to warn the public, but because they may have other agendas. Alex Jones, the host of the alarmist far-right show Infowars, is perhaps the most successful, visible example of someone building an empire out of peddling conspiracy theories \u2014 the more absurd, the better. But he\u2019s not alone. Conspiracy theories flourish on TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube (which has long fought a battle against those who spread them) not just because individual theories go viral, but because their creators can become hugely influential.  One prominent example is Teal Swan, a new-age vlogger notorious for urging her 750,000 followers toward suicidal ideation. Swan released a video in May that strongly implied that various world governments had facilitated the Covid-19 pandemic to profit from individuals, and that anyone entering quarantine was \u201ca herd animal\u201d being \u201ccontrolled by others.\u201d If you run a Google search on Swan, the results suggest that she is \u201can American teacher,\u201d thus lending her an unearned authority \u2014 a status she shares with many other conspiracy theory gurus.  Another example is Dave Hayes, a Christian writer and YouTuber who\u2019s become a minor leading figure in the QAnon-believers community after he claimed that God explained QAnon to him in a series of prophetic dreams. Hayes and Swan have long built their brands around bizarre ideas; Hayes, for example, promotes a book on his website that he describes as a guide to prophecy and raising the dead. These figures have little to lose by claiming to be authorities on conspiracy theories, and plenty to gain \u2014 from monetized YouTube views to lucrative consulting gigs to sales of books and writings.  This brings us to someone who\u2019s directly profited from the recent spread of conspiracy theories in an atypical way: President Trump. Radford has argued that Trump\u2019s dedication to spreading unfounded or unscientific ideas is a huge reason conspiracy theories have gained such traction over the past decade. \u201cLike him or hate him, Trump has used and benefited from and promoted conspiracy theories in a way that no previous president has,\u201d Radford told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just unprecedented.\u201d Researchers have found that when Trump publicly endorses a belief, his followers become more likely to believe it, regardless of whether it\u2019s factually supported.  Trump has a long history of promoting conspiracy theories, dating from well before his time in politics; in 2007, he claimed that vaccines cause autism. His political career arguably started when he began to spread the false \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. Conspiracy theories have consistently been key to galvanizing his pious voter base. His supporters\u2019 fears over \u201cillegal votes\u201d currently serve as the foundation for Trump\u2019s attempts to dispute his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. Eleanor told me she blames Trump specifically for her father\u2019s rapidly evolving distrust of mainstream media, which, like many Trump supporters, he now abbreviates simply as \u201cMSM.\u201d Instead of getting his information from regular media sources, Eleanor said, her father uses Trump\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 which has been dominated lately by the president\u2019s unfounded claims that the election was a scam \u2014 as his primary news source. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a conversation that you can have\u201d with him, she told me, \u201cand this is where I think Trump is so dangerous. What he\u2019s done to just instill that distrust of the media \u2014 you can\u2019t even say, \u2018Well, here\u2019s an article I read that differs from what you said.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, like I\u2019m going to believe CNN. Oh, like I\u2019m going to believe the New York Times.\u2019 So it\u2019s all a lie.\u201d Eleanor feels that Trump has emboldened this type of thinking. \u201cBefore, there was maybe a little bit of shame or embarrassment\u201d in believing that social institutions like the media were conspiring against the people, she said. But now, many people seem to proudly indulge in this belief; her father, at Trump\u2019s explicit urging, has claimed that the mainstream media is all part of the big conspiracy.  Eleanor\u2019s reluctance to talk to her father about all of this over fear of the outcome is another factor in the inexorable spread of conspiracy theories: Confronting them with criticism and logic seems to only make them stronger and more difficult to quell. People who adopt the conspiratorial mindset derive three main benefits from doing so. First, there\u2019s an epistemic benefit: Whatever conspiracy theory they believe in provides a framework for understanding the world and bringing order to random events. Second, there\u2019s an existential benefit, in that the conspiracy theory can distract them from facing their fears about sociopolitical upheaval and uncertainty. And third, there\u2019s a social benefit, in that the conspiracy theory provides them with a community of similarly disaffected thinkers who can validate one another\u2019s anxieties and shared worldview. The epistemic benefit is especially important, given the rise in polarization across the ideological spectrum. Vox\u2019s David Roberts has called this trend \u201ctribal epistemology,\u201d in which \u201cinformation is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence\u201d but on whether your community or \u201ctribe\u201d advocates for it. In this environment, Roberts argues, the primary institutions of society \u2014 government, academia, science, and media, which used to be seen as impartial authorities \u2014 can be rejected if they contradict your tribe\u2019s worldview. A partisan refusal to compromise was once a sign of extremism, but it\u2019s now almost expected, at least in certain tribes. \u201cTruth,\u201d then, is whatever the tribal rhetoric says it is. This cultish approach to information can directly impact how \u201cfacts\u201d are transmitted and received. When people at either end of the political spectrum consider the news media to be biased or corrupt, they\u2019re prone to support even more biased, less objective sources of information. And because those sources tend to embrace conspiracy theories that align with tribal rhetoric, the theories then become difficult to debunk. Conspiracy theorists have what Radford describes as \u201cself-reinforcing belief systems,\u201d which is also part of why the theories spread so quickly \u2014 particularly the political ones. Often, an emotional byproduct of a conspiracy theory is to make the audience feel as though they\u2019ve arrived at a profound new realization about the world on their own. \u201cThey think they\u2019re thinking more critically, when in fact they\u2019re thinking less critically,\u201d van der Linden said.  \u201cThe conspiracy theory provides an access point to people,\u201d Radford told me. \u201cThey think they\u2019re given the key, right? So they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re woke, and you\u2019re taking the red pill, or blue pill, or whatever the hell pill it is, then you know; you understand what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d People who have bought in often believe they can see patterns, codes, and symbols that the rest of us can\u2019t \u2014 a false phenomenon called apophenia, which further validates their beliefs.  For those who are already unorthodox thinkers, the conspiracy theory offers a form of validation. Online, van der Linden observed, \u201cthere\u2019s a whole community out there posting the same thing, validating your beliefs, and you get to chat with people with the same worldview as yours. ... You feel marginalized in society, but now you have a group that you belong to and [are] affiliated with. And it\u2019s a really strong way for people to feel empowered socially, to connect through these conspiracies.\u201d Once someone has accepted one far-fetched conspiracy theory, it often becomes easier to accept others. Even in cases where two conspiracy theories contradict each other, many conspiracy advocates will believe both of them \u2014 because they\u2019ve found an even deeper rationale to explain the inconsistencies. \u201cAnd before you know it,\u201d said van der Linden, \u201cthey\u2019re wrapped up in this worldview where everything is a conspiracy.\u201d Many people who believe in conspiracy theories often don\u2019t just accept the theory as truth \u2014 they allow it to influence their entire life. \u201cWe sometimes refer to [conspiratorial groupthink] as a quasi-religious worldview,\u201d van der Linden told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not religion, because it\u2019s not institutionalized, but it has all the features of extreme religious groups.\u201d   One quasi-religious trait is how conspiracy theories seem to rapidly change the lives and relationships of their advocates. Across the US, families and friendships are increasingly becoming divided over QAnon or similar conspiracy theories. (And lest you think it\u2019s a generational thing, it\u2019s not; kids are falling for it, too.) On Reddit, where QAnon-peddling groups have recently been banned, the subreddits r/QAnonCasualties and r/ReQovery offer spaces for family members to process what\u2019s happened to their loved ones.  In a since-deleted post, one woman wrote about having to escape from her family cabin after her mother and aunts brought her there for a weekend retreat, in what she said turned out to be an attempt to isolate her and reprogram her into accepting QAnon beliefs. Although QAnon is not a religion, the theory\u2019s community acts on its followers in similar ways, leading some to try to convert unbelievers \u2014 or, if failing, to shun them.  \u201cI think my marriage of 13 years is over because of QAnon,\u201d detailed another member who said their partner had succumbed to belief in QAnon. \u201cToday, we began a discussion about [Supreme Court Justice] Amy Coney Barrett and while it started as civil it blew out of proportion so quickly,\u201d another wrote. \u201cMy mom called me \u2018pure evil,\u2019 said I was a demon ... and that all Democrats were killing babies to drink their blood.\u201d  Reddit user graneflatsis, a moderator of QAnonCasualties who\u2019s in their 50s, told me that a few common themes had emerged from the forum that resembled stories of cult-like behavior: stories of QAnon believers displaying mania, as well as signs of sleep deprivation due to so much time spent researching and recruiting for the cause.  \u201cWhoever Q is just kept at it and added more lurid details,\u201d graneflatsis told me. (\u201cQAnon\u201d can refer to the original anonymous 4chan poster, known as \u201cQAnon\u201d or \u201cQ,\u201d whose theories form the basis of QAnon beliefs, or it can refer to the beliefs themselves, i.e., the QAnon conspiracy theory.) \u201cQAnon has the right chemistry, as far as a conspiracy goes,\u201d graneflatsis said. \u201cPizzagate gave QAnon a lot of [momentum] that lasts till today. The narrative that these anons are saving the world is so attractive to folk disenchanted with the way things are.\u201d  As much as conspiracy theories can bring people together, they can also alienate people from larger society. \u201cConspiracies completely disrupt the extent to which people care about other people,\u201d van der Linden told me. Researchers have found, he added, that \u201cone of the negative effects of conspiracy theories is that people are less willing to help others. People are less willing to engage politically, people are less willing to do something about global warming.\u201d At the extreme edges of the conspiratorial belief system, this kind of us-versus-them worldview can engender violence. Graneflatsis told me that while \u201cthere\u2019s a subsection of folk who just like [QAnon] because it gives them some ammo to use against Democrats,\u201d the moderators of QAnonCasualties have had to ban numerous QAnon supporters attempting to recruit members of the community, many using violent rhetoric.  Political scientists and researchers who study extremism have warned that QAnon, in particular, mirrors the wider rise in extremism around the globe and encourages its supporters to act on extremist impulses. Within the past year, QAnon supporters have allegedly engaged in numerous bizarre acts of disruption and crimes, including attempted kidnapping, plotting to assassinate government officials, and committing voter fraud. In 2019, the FBI labeled QAnon a brand of domestic terrorism. But if some conspiracy theories are now being considered forms of violent extremism, that indicates how different today\u2019s conspiracy theories are from the traditional UFO or JFK variety. They seem to be disrupting the lives of more people than ever \u2014 which is why there\u2019s so much clamor about what, if anything, we can do about dismantling them. The knee-jerk tendency most rational-minded people have when confronted with a conspiracy theory that seems absurd to them is to deploy a combination of yelling, dismissiveness, and logic or scientific evidence to talk the conspiracy theorist out of their belief. When all else fails, the rational person may resort to shunning the believer outright.  The problem with these approaches is that they generally make the believer feel defensive, which causes them to double down on their belief systems. That\u2019s not an ideal outcome \u2014 especially considering that, as Radford and van der Linden both stressed to me, many people, when left to their own devices, eventually talk themselves out of a conspiracy theory. They often \u201cwake up\u201d to the discovery that their favorite conspiracy theory is actually more fringe, racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise dangerous than they realized.  This is where empathy comes in. Radford stressed that conspiracy theories aren\u2019t limited to one side of the political spectrum, and neither is the magical thinking that spawns them. \u201cIf you take a deep dive into any given person\u2019s belief system, you\u2019ll probably find at least a few deeply held beliefs that aren\u2019t based in fact,\u201d he pointed out. Believing in a conspiracy theory doesn\u2019t make someone unintelligent, ignorant, or evil. It just means they\u2019ve encountered bad information \u2014 and these days, bad information is everywhere. Nearly everyone I spoke to while reporting this story had a loved one who\u2019d adopted conspiratorial thinking to some degree. That\u2019s actually how graneflatsis wound up moderating QAnonCasualties. \u201cMy father was brainwashed by Fox News into this really angry guy that would just shout at the TV all day,\u201d they said. Graneflatsis says they eventually talked their dad out of it by applying a cocktail of logic, empathy, and good humor to cut the tension and keep things even-toned and nonthreatening.  One strategy that often works to convince people to rethink their positions on fake news and propaganda, meanwhile, is to discuss the common mechanisms behind the spread of misinformation. A key to recognizing the lie behind a conspiracy, van der Linden says, is to note that the tactics of spreading a conspiracy theory stay the same even if the specifics of the theory change. The use of a false authority figure, the appeal to an individual\u2019s anger and prejudices, and the urgency of the claim \u2014 these are all conspiratorial mainstays. To help spread awareness of such tactics, van der Linden\u2019s research team recently designed and released an online game, Go Viral!, that teaches the player to recognize the factors that help spread fake news. The game was based on research that found that people who are educated to recognize how misinformation spreads are less likely to be duped by it, or to spread it themselves in turn.  That information might be useful for Eleanor, who told me she wanted to speak to me for this story in part as a form of therapy, and in part because she didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cI have one sister and one brother and I\u2019m sure [my dad is] ashamed of the fact that we\u2019re dirty liberals, all three of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it at all. This conversation has not been had.\u201d Unfortunately, ignoring conspiracy theories in the hope they\u2019ll go away, or out of fear that acknowledging them will somehow validate them, may be the wrong choice. Left unchallenged, a conspiracy theory can create a shift in people\u2019s views. For example, through his research, van der Linden found that even 30 seconds of exposure to a global warming hoax can make people less willing to sign a petition to take action against climate change. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exposure to a conspiracy among people who don\u2019t believe in conspiracy,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s [not] only the people who are deeply entangled in this for whom this is damaging.\u201d But for those who are exhausted by constant ideological warfare, ignoring fringe beliefs and the people who spout them may just be the easiest option. Van der Linden pointed out that a lot of people, in general, are burned out. Ideally, he said, people would have \u201ca network and trust and support that enables different ideas about the world. But I think the problem is people\u2019s patience has run out. Political hostility is rampant; polarization is too high at the moment to create the conditions that are necessary for that.\u201d Still, he said, an approach of \u201cactively open-minded thinking\u201d is the best path forward that he\u2019s found. \u201cI think at the end of the day, you know, being open-minded will help everyone.\u201d  However, something that van der Linden told me about one of his close family members was both unsettling and revealing. The relative, once a die-hard 9/11 truther, has become less radicalized over time \u2014 not particularly because of any tactics van der Linden deployed, but because he started a family and simply had less time to do conspiracy theory research. And this \u2014 life simply taking its course \u2014 is what Radford tells me may eventually bring an end to the current wave of conspiratorial thinking dominated by QAnon, coronavirus denial, and their ilk. He argued that there\u2019s a \u201cfad aspect\u201d to the current trend \u2014 that conspiracy theories and moral panics have existed for centuries, and while the human tendency to embrace them won\u2019t ever disappear completely, it will diminish in the face of political and economic stability. \u201cA lot of this is rooted in social anxiety about politics, about the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cSooner or later, life will gradually return to normalcy.\u201d   Still, it\u2019s undeniable that we face ongoing battles against misinformation, on subjects from Covid-19 to climate change, from vaccines to votes. The legitimization of conspiracies over the past decade, especially during the Trump administration, has fundamentally altered the way many of us receive and accept information, so that now many people, without any evidence, view scientific method and fact-based journalism as suspicious, and see once-trusted leaders as nefarious plotters. The damage to the public trust has been severe and won\u2019t be easily healed.  And while the idea of a return to normalcy is something many of us long for, it seems foolish to accept, uncritically, that normalcy will come back to save us. If anything, conspiracy theories seem to have shifted American society toward an ever-widening gap between belief and reality \u2014 one in which a consensus on what \u201cnormal\u201d is seems further away than ever.",

    "article_text": "Do you really have to wash your mask after every use? Short answer: Yes. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, face masks have become a necessity, like keys or your wallet \u2014 you can\u2019t leave home without them. For the reusable cloth masks popular with so many people, that means a lot of laundry.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing masks in public settings, mainly to protect others from carriers of the virus. Many states, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and major retailers also require patrons to wear masks in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19.  Protective face masks have become a controversial touchpoint of the pandemic, with some Americans complaining and even having outbursts about wearing them. But science shows that masks are essential to preventing the spread of the virus.  \u201cWe know the effectiveness of face masks already. There is the evidence base out there,\u201d said Dr. Simon Kolstoe, a senior lecturer in evidence-based health care at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom.  But there\u2019s one question that dogs mask-wearers: Do you really have to wash them after every use? The answer is yes. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely recommended to wash that mask every day,\u201d said Dr. Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist. Kullar points out that the purpose of the mask is to prevent the virus from spreading, so if there are virus particles on yours, wearing an unwashed mask is counterproductive.  Still, despite this advice, surface transmission is not thought to be a major vector of coronavirus spread. The primary transmission mode is person-to-person contact. The recommendation to wash your mask comes out of an abundance of caution, as well as the object\u2019s close proximity to respiratory output. The CDC also recommends washing masks: \u201cMasks should be washed after each use. It is important to always remove masks correctly and wash your hands after handling or touching a used mask,\u201d the website says. According to the CDC, taking off your mask correctly means handling it only by the ear loops or ties, folding it to be placed in the washing machine, and washing your hands immediately after.  Cloth masks can be washed by hand or in a washing machine. Surgical masks, another popular option, cannot be washed and should be discarded after one use. There is very little \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d information about how to wash an N95 mask. Some potential options include vaporized hydrogen peroxide, using dry heat, or UV light \u2014 methods that aren\u2019t really suitable for experimentation at home.  For cloth masks, if you\u2019re using a washing machine, the CDC recommends regular detergent and \u201cthe warmest appropriate water setting for the cloth used to make the mask.\u201d If you\u2019re washing your mask by hand, you should prepare a bleach solution and soak your mask in it for five minutes, then rinse in cool or room-temperature water. Mask filters should be washed by hand.  There are also certain practices to ensure you wash your mask effectively without wearing down the fabric too much.  Patric Richardson, the self-styled Laundry Evangelist, said that a cloth mask can sustain around 100 washes if it isn\u2019t run through the dryer, and 50 if it is. He also explained that the elastic parts of the mask are likely to wear down more quickly than the actual cloth.  \u201cDepending on the fabric, and of course that\u2019s the million-dollar question with a handmade mask, but most fabrics are very durable for about 100 washes if they\u2019re not in the dryer,\u201d he said.  Richardson also recommends wearing face masks made of cotton, which he said is most durable. While other materials like silk or even using bandannas are popular, they are often less effective and don\u2019t last as long. In addition to picking a good material, Richardson stressed using detergent sparingly.  \u201cThe skin on your face is pretty sensitive so you want to make sure that you don\u2019t use very much detergent because you want to rinse it 100 percent clean,\u201d he said.  In addition to maintaining good washing practices, the type of face mask you use matters, too. Dr. Kolstoe made a video, testing different kinds of masks by attempting to blow out a lit match. If you can blow out the match, the mask is ineffective. And if you can\u2019t, it works.  \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing this mask to stop you blowing your breath over other people, it makes sense that if you could blow a match out [or] blow a candle out that\u2019s directly in front of you then the mask isn\u2019t being particularly effective,\u201d he said.  Eventually, an overwashed mask could become more porous and lose its usefulness. When that happens, it\u2019s time to get some new masks, either by buying them or making your own. Whichever you choose, just be sure you clean them after each use.",

    "article_text": "How Santas are handling a pandemic Christmas season He\u2019s making a list, he\u2019s checking it twice \u2014 and it\u2019s probably going to include hand sanitizer, face masks, and extra gloves. Not even Santa Claus is exempt from the struggles of 2020, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to get him early vaccine access, and Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s assurance to American children that he has \u201cinnate immunity.\u201d  While some retailers, like Macy\u2019s, have nixed in-person Santa visits altogether, others, from mall operator Brookfield Properties to Bass Pro Shops, are adapting to meet safety guidelines by putting Santa behind plexiglass or offering families the chance to share their Christmas lists with him on video chat.  Pandemic-era Santa visits have even spawned a whole cottage industry, from JingleRing, a new platform designed to simplify virtual Santa visits, to plastic snow globe tents. The Goods called four Santas \u2014 from The Real Black Santa, who\u2019s learning a new virtual system in order to reach a wider audience, to an adults-only Santa figuring out how to translate his raunchy humor to Zoom parties \u2014 to hear how they\u2019re approaching the 2020 Christmas season.  At Cabela\u2019s here \u2014 and I believe it\u2019s true chain-wide \u2014 they have a three-eighths inch, about 6-by-6 foot piece of plexiglass between us and the guests. Santa wears a face shield as well. When folks sit down for photos, they can take their masks off. Since I\u2019m behind the plexiglass and a face shield, that makes me feel comfortable. It\u2019s a pretty wide-open space, there\u2019s a lot of air circulation. After every guest, the elves wipe down the seat, and every hour they wipe down the plexiglass. It hurts when somebody brings up a 4-month-old baby because we can\u2019t hold them \u2014 that\u2019s one of the parts I think we all have difficulty with. But I\u2019ll tell you, last night I had a 5-year-old boy. As he approached Santa, he started to run, full speed. And he kind of leapt and smacked into the plexiglass. As soon as I realized what was happening, I put my hand up and I steadied the plexiglass so there was no chance of him knocking it over. He looked like a cartoon \u2014 his nose went a little flat, his eyes were wide open, his hands were out, arms wide open, thinking he was gonna get to Santa. And he almost slid down a little bit. Then he shook it off and laughed and sat down and got his picture taken. Some of the guys are experimenting with baby monitors. So we can put a baby monitor on [the guest\u2019s] side that nobody touches, but we can hear the kids talking. We\u2019re trying that out just to see if we can help because some of the kids are so soft-spoken. It\u2019s a little harder to joke around with the kids, but they get it. I mean, one of the sad things is watching how comfortable these children are zipping their masks on and off. I think what people need to focus on is what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do. If you worry about what you can\u2019t do, that\u2019ll just ruin the holiday. The virtual studio for me was not new. My company, The Real Black Santa, has been in business 19 years now, so it was easy for us to go virtual because we had the backdrop and the lighting, all the things that were necessary, from doing mall visits. The hardest part about it was learning the computer system OBS, which is what a lot of gamers use, and doing it through Zoom or Skype. With JingleRing, they have a proprietary platform that we\u2019re using. Basically you just need a blue or green screen backdrop, and you get working. They brought me on as a brand ambassador, so they\u2019ve got me doing videos for the company, and I\u2019m also trying to get additional Santas to come on board.  [Online], it\u2019s still that same greeting that you have when you\u2019re in the mall. But the good thing about it is Santa is actually calling you from his workshop. If they hear noise in the background, those are the elves, making toys. Mom and Dad have already given us some detailed information about what the kids got for Christmas the year before, how they were performing in school, you know, are they helping at home. As a Santa, you have to be a better performer, and know how to talk to somebody as if they were standing in front of you.  Most guys who are doing Santa \u2014 we\u2019re a little older. We\u2019re in that category where we\u2019re overweight, a lot of the guys are diabetic, have heart problems, and so forth. It\u2019s hard for us not to be in front of the kids. And though I want to be out there doing events, I don\u2019t want to be behind a partition while kids are in front of me. I think that\u2019s more impersonal than not being there. And I\u2019d hate to sit in front of 20 kids, and I have something or contract something and pass it on to somebody else.  I have a lot of clients that are still calling wanting us to do in-person visits right now. And as much as I want to, I\u2019m shying away from it. Usually, the day after Christmas I\u2019m getting event bookings for the following year. I had to cancel the ones that we\u2019ve already booked. So yeah, this definitely is a hit on the pocket. I\u2019ve been working with my clients to determine what they\u2019re expecting from Santa; some of them want Santa with the mask, some of them don\u2019t. l show up at the residence, we\u2019ll social distance, and then when we get ready to take pictures, I\u2019ll get seated and then the kids will back up into me so that we\u2019re not facing each other. Once the pictures are over, if they want to have a one-on-one with Santa, then I\u2019ll put a mask on. I\u2019ve had 14 different masks made by a local seamstress, with snowflakes and reindeer and that kind of thing. I\u2019ve bought tons of sanitizer, so I\u2019m sanitizing before and after each visit. I bought an extra four dozen gloves, so I\u2019ll change my gloves after every visit. I went ahead and bought two more suits this year, which will give me seven so I can change my suit every day of the week. I\u2019ve got a UVB light set up in a closet, and I can also sanitize them that way. My business is probably down 50 percent this year, but I\u2019m seeing a little bit of an uptick in home visits. They\u2019re around 60-40 indoors-outdoors. I looked into the Zoom thing, and to be honest with you, there\u2019s a pretty good capital outlay. You have to buy green screens, cameras, and ring lights and backdrops and all that stuff. And I\u2019m more about the personal visit anyway. That\u2019s kind of why I don\u2019t do the malls, because that\u2019s more about the picture. The weekend after Thanksgiving through Christmas, I\u2019ve got 48 visits booked, and I usually run about 70 a year. I\u2019m going to go try to get tested at least 14 days prior to that. I\u2019ve also invested in a thermometer, so that if people would like to check temperatures, we can do that before we get started. I\u2019m going to be cautious and use common sense. And if something gets out of hand, I will stop whatever we\u2019re doing. But I\u2019m not too worried about it. I\u2019m probably one of the younger Santas around here, and I don\u2019t have any underlying health issues. If I get it, I get it. Gigs were starting to come in, and then Washington recently put a moratorium on gatherings larger than five. It\u2019s definitely a big hit. In a normal year, I personally do about 10 to 12 [bookings] through the holiday season. It\u2019s not a ton, but I can always depend on a good little paycheck in January from it. But also, it\u2019s just super fun.  My Bad Santa is the jolly, drinky uncle that comes to the party \u2014 like, you don\u2019t want him to sleep over, but for 30 minutes, people love it. He\u2019s fun, he doesn\u2019t upset anybody, he tells all the ladies they\u2019re pretty and tells some very off-color jokes. I have a lot of clients that come back to me year after year for corporate parties. Some of these groups have been coming back to me for years. I\u2019ve always felt a little bit like a part of the family coming in on a special party night, like, \u201cRemember, last year when you made that North Pole joke, and my wife spit up her drink?\u201d Usually, depending on the client, I\u2019ll get a little bit of roasting information so I can come prepared to zing people. I\u2019ll probably end up using technology a little bit, maybe some silly virtual backdrops that\u2019ll kind of elevate the comedy, ideally. But nothing beats the live in-person improv in the physical space, right? You can still improv, but as we all know, these Zoom things are a little hard to manage, because people want to talk over each other and laugh, so that dynamic tends to be a challenge to kind of manage the flow of the party in the comedy.  But I think people are so hungry for connection right now. I think if anything, people will, to some degree, suspend their disbelief and be like, this is as good as we can get right now. Let\u2019s really lean into it and enjoy the togetherness even if it\u2019s through a screen.",

    "article_text": "Why every state should adopt a mask mandate, in 4 charts Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, toured North Dakota this fall, as the state was overwhelmed by one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the country. While she commended the state\u2019s testing efforts, she was distraught by the noticeable lack of face masks in public spaces. \u201cThis is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,\u201d she said at an October 26 press conference.  North Dakota, which at the time didn\u2019t require masks, had the lowest mask-wearing rate in the country in October, according to survey data.  North Dakota is not the only state that lagged in a mask policy in the throes of a major outbreak, however: Eight of the top 10 states that saw the highest new cases per capita in October did not have a widespread mask mandate, as the chart below shows. (Several of these Great Plains and Midwestern states were spared significant outbreaks of the virus until the fall.) But the dramatic surge of Covid-19 across the country this fall and winter has forced some states to change course. On November 8, Utah implemented a mask mandate, as new daily Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the state and across the country. Several other states have implemented or tightened mandates since then, including Iowa and North Dakota. Thirty-seven states now have mandates, according to the AARP.  And on December 4, the CDC issued a new recommendation that people wear masks indoors at all times, unless they are at home. Over the course of the pandemic, America has been engaged in a massive and uncontrolled mask experiment: Some jurisdictions implemented and enforced mask mandates; others rejected them as public health guidance became politicized. President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned and even scorned the use of masks, and several Republican governors have followed his lead. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, has called for a national mask mandate and for Americans to wear masks for the \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d he is in office, as vaccines roll out.  But the different state-level approaches mean researchers can now parse the results of a trial they never would have received approval to conduct. New research from Kansas and Tennessee suggests that not only do mask mandates prevent Covid-19 spread, they may also blunt the severity of illness and reduce the number of serious cases that require hospitalization. Other findings support the argument more and more public health experts are making: that masks remain among our cheapest most effective tools to control the pandemic \u2014 if worn consistently.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the ICU, the only tools at our disposal that we know work are the tried-and-true public health measures, like social distancing, hand-washing, and masks,\u201d says Vin Gupta, a critical care pulmonologist and affiliate assistant professor for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re bearing the brunt of those things being implemented poorly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to get Covid-19 if you\u2019re wearing a mask,\u201d says Donna Ginther, an economist and director of the Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas. And \u201ceven if you do get sick while wearing a mask, you\u2019re less likely to get deathly ill.\u201d  Let\u2019s walk through some of the latest research on mask mandates and what it means as we head into one of the most perilous seasons in the pandemic so far.  One intriguing piece of evidence of the effect of mask mandates on controlling the spread of the virus comes from Kansas. In July, Laura Kelly, the Democratic governor of Kansas, issued a mandate requiring everyone in public places to wear a mask where 6 feet of social distancing couldn\u2019t be maintained. It prompted an immediate outcry from conservatives. Because of a state law passed in June that allowed counties to supersede the governor\u2019s emergency powers, 81 counties out of 105 opted out of the mask mandate altogether, and only 21 counties decided to enforce it. Two researchers from the University of Kansas analyzed what happened next. Ginther, the economist working on this analysis, found that in the counties that enforced mask-wearing, new cases stayed roughly steady. But in the counties without mandates, even after controlling for how often people left their homes, they doubled. \u201cWe were stunned by the strength of the effect,\u201d she says.  The public health officer of Johnson, the state\u2019s largest county, was so impressed he asked Ginther to share her work with the Board of County Commissioners, even though it\u2019s not yet peer-reviewed or even written up into a paper. She is currently working on publishing the results. Ginther says it wasn\u2019t until 12 weeks after the mandates took effect that the growth in cases began to slow. But she thinks her results are likely conservative. \u201cA 50 percent reduction in cases is likely to be a lower-bound on the true effect of wearing a mask,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you had 100 percent compliance, I would expect to see an even larger effect.\u201d  Other researchers have made related findings. A nonprofit group called Prevent Epidemics recently published a report showing that, following mask mandates, coronavirus cases declined in Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. The CDC found that in Arizona, after a mask mandate was put in place, Covid-19 cases dropped 75 percent. Conversely, cases spiked 151 percent when stay-at-home orders were lifted, demonstrating that behavior has a significant impact on viral transmission.  In addition to slowing the spread of the virus, new evidence from Tennessee shows that mask mandates could reduce the severity of the virus. A paper by researchers at Vanderbilt found that at Tennessee hospitals where at least 75 percent of Covid-19 patients came from counties with mask requirements, coronavirus hospitalization rates are the same as they were in July. In hospitals where fewer than 25 percent of patients come from places with a mask mandate, hospitalizations are 200 percent higher. What\u2019s more, the researchers wrote, hospitals in areas with mask requirements and other mitigation strategies \u201care in a much better position to serve the entire spectrum of community health needs, not just Covid-19 patients.\u201d Even if they aren\u2019t always followed, mask mandates appear to be an effective tool in encouraging behavior change. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found in August that mask use increased 8 percentage points after mask mandates, and increased 15 points if those mandates were enforced. Only around 65 percent of Americans currently regularly wear masks, according to IHME. But in Singapore, for instance, around 95 percent of people wear masks, and they have one of the world\u2019s lowest coronavirus death rates. \u201cWe know that countries that wear masks are doing much better,\u201d says Ali Mokdad, the chief strategy officer of public health at the University of Washington. Thirty-three states and Washington, DC, implemented statewide mask mandates between April and August. During the same period, an increasing number of Americans began to wear masks regularly, according to a weekly survey started in mid-April by the data intelligence company Premise.  There is one caveat of all the analyses mentioned above: They simply observe behavior, which means that they can demonstrate associations \u2014 like case counts falling after mask mandates are put in place \u2014 but not causation. The gold standard to prove that would be a randomized controlled trial. But that\u2019s a hard study to design in a pandemic because of ethical concerns.  Even without randomized trials, Rebekah Gee, a public health policy expert and secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health, says the body of evidence \u201cconfirms what public health experts have known since early on in this pandemic, which is that masks work.\u201d In fact, a study published October 23 in Nature Medicine by IHME\u2019s forecasting team modeled current public health interventions \u2014 projecting case numbers based on current behavior \u2014 and found that universal mask use could save as many as 130,000 lives by the end of February 2021.  Mokdad says that\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have clear, consistent recommendations to wear masks. He adds, \u201cWe never debate seatbelts. Is it okay if only 80 percent of people wear them? We say everybody should.\u201d But while he would prefer that 100 percent of people wear masks, Mokdad says at this point, any incremental increase in mask use \u201cfor me is a celebration.\u201d Unfortunately, in many parts of the US, mask use is actually decreasing. In Florida, for example, which grappled with a serious surge in cases this summer, Mokdad says 70 percent of people were wearing masks in August. Now, only 65 percent are. \u201cWearing masks has been a response to fear rather than a good, persistent behavior,\u201d Mokdad says.  Vox analyzed the relationship between the frequency of wearing masks from the Premise survey data and the Covid-19 cases in states from April to October. As the charts below show, in states with mandates where cases surged in the spring, more people now wear masks. These states \u2014 where more people consistently wear masks \u2014 are now less likely to see another huge surge in cases.  Even though mask use has risen in many states, the nation as a whole is on a troubling trajectory, with new daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all on the rise. Mokdad says he\u2019s very concerned about the holidays. \u201cAs we go be with our loved ones \u2014 our grandparents, our kids \u2014 do you want to go sit at a table and risk the people you care about most, or do you want to wear a mask?\u201d IHME models predict that if some US states increased their mask use from now on, they could reduce the number of future Covid-19 deaths by about 50 percent. The stakes for getting this right are high \u2014 not just for the holidays, but for the rest of the pandemic, however long that might be.  Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently echoed Biden\u2019s call for a national mask mandate. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to shut down, at least do the fundamental, basic things,\u201d Fauci told the editor-in-chief of JAMA, \u201cthe flagship of which is wearing a mask.\u201d Rather than thinking about a mask mandate as something that takes away a freedom, as anti-mask protestors have claimed, Leana Wen, a physician and the former Health Commissioner for the City of Baltimore, says, \u201cMask-wearing allows you to do things.\u201d If everyone wears a mask, it will keep transmission low, allowing businesses and schools to stay open.  \u201cIf you want a more normal life, we need to adjust our behavior, as opposed to locking ourselves away,\u201d Ginther says. \u201cMasks rise to the top as an approach we can take as a society to have a more open economy but not get everyone sick.\u201d Lois Parshley is a freelance investigative journalist.

Editor\u2019s note, November 7: Due to a data error, a previous version of the chart of increases in Covid-19 cases in October did not include Hawaii and miscategorized Louisiana as not having a mandate. In fact, Louisiana implemented a mandate in August. The chart has been updated to reflect these changes.   ",

    "article_text": "Moderna released more Covid-19 vaccine results. They\u2019re very encouraging. With the already staggering coronavirus case and death toll expected to climb further in the US following Thanksgiving, there\u2019s at least more good news on the vaccine front. The biotech firm Moderna released the final results of its 30,000-person vaccine trial in a press release Monday, reporting a 94.1 percent rate of efficacy. The finding squares with the 94.5 percent efficacy rate the company reported two weeks ago, based on its first interim analysis of trial data.  Of the 196 Covid-19 cases in the trial, 185 were in the placebo group and only 11 in the vaccine group, Moderna reported. Even more important, the vaccine \u2014 called mRNA-1273 \u2014 appears to protect against severe disease, not just asymptomatic or mild cases. Of the 30 severe Covid-19 cases among trial participants, all occurred in the placebo group. If the finding is real, it would likely mean averted deaths and hospitalizations when millions of people are immunized.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got 100 percent protection against severe disease,\u201d Paul Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told Vox. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable.\u201d  \u201cIf these numbers are right, it\u2019s more than we\u2019d need for the vaccine to be a major control measure for this outbreak,\u201d said Eric Rubin, an infectious disease specialist and the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.  Moderna\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, said in the press release that the company plans to request an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which would allow the vaccine to be used in limited cases for people facing some of the highest risk of exposure to Covid-19, like health care workers. \u201cWe believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,\u201d he added. Given that the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford coronavirus vaccine research groups have also put out promising findings recently, this latest announcement of final data from the Moderna trial reaffirms that the world will likely have several highly effective vaccines for Covid-19 \u2014 and the end of the pandemic may be on the horizon. High efficacy also means that fewer people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, the threshold at which the virus can no longer spread easily from person to person. But, as always, there are caveats. In this case, the vaccine requires two doses, there are some side effects, and we don\u2019t yet have details about how the vaccine worked in high-risk groups. And while demonstrating efficacy is important, the road to getting millions of people vaccinated will be fraught with logistical challenges. A lot of difficult work on a Covid-19 vaccine still lies ahead. Moderna\u2019s announcement of 94.1 percent efficacy is based on a phase 3 clinical trial. In particular, the results are from the COVE study, conducted in collaboration with the US government\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Phase 3 is where the vaccine is tested against the virus spreading in the real world. Since experimenters can\u2019t deliberately infect people, they have to wait and see who gets sick with Covid-19 in their volunteer pool, comparing the group that received the actual vaccine to the group that received the placebo. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is administered as two doses. To speed up the process, researchers recruit thousands of volunteers so that the rate of accumulating infections goes up. But it only takes a handful of infections to demonstrate that the vaccine works. If a vaccine doesn\u2019t work, and half the people in the trial get the vaccine and the other half get the placebo, we\u2019d expect coronavirus cases to be evenly split in the two groups, Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, told Vox. But when a vaccine is effective, we get results like the ones Moderna is reporting.  According to the biotech firm, experimenters detected 11 cases in people who received two doses of the vaccine compared to 185 in the placebo group. This shows that the virus was spreading among volunteers in the clinical trial but was drastically lower among those who received Moderna\u2019s vaccine. \u201cWhen we think about the level of evidence, this is a strong result,\u201d Dean said.  Moderna\u2019s latest results were announced in a press release, and came directly from the company. While there have been several peer-reviewed interim studies about its vaccine, Monday\u2019s announcement of final results didn\u2019t arrive with any published data \u2014 just like the November 16 announcement of interim results. That doesn\u2019t mean the findings are wrong, but they lack critical details and nuances we need to interpret them \u2014 like how well the vaccine works if people get only one dose (not an unlikely scenario in the real world) and how effective it is in high-risk groups. We don\u2019t know anything on the former, and on the latter, Moderna has only reported that \u201cefficacy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity, and gender demographics.\u201d While the company provided numbers for how many trial participants were over 65 and from various ethnic communities, the company didn\u2019t say how the vaccine performed in each of these subgroups. That information is critical, since these are the people who\u2019ve been hardest hit by the virus. We also don\u2019t yet know how long people who got the vaccine remain protected from the virus, Dean pointed out. There are also the side effects to consider. Moderna has reported no serious safety issues to date and said that most problems tended to be mild to moderate \u2014 but up to 10 percent of participants experienced severe side effects, according to an earlier press release. These included fatigue (9.7 percent), muscle pain (8.9 percent), joint pain (5.2 percent), headache (4.5 percent), other pain (4.1 percent), and redness at the injection site (2 percent). Since the vaccines will ultimately have to be distributed to millions, if not billions, of people, it\u2019s important to pay attention to side effects. Rare complications will be more likely to show up once lots of people get the shot. And clinical trials of other Covid-19 vaccine candidates \u2014 like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine \u2014 have already been paused due to complications among recipients.  If the Moderna vaccine receives emergency approval in the US, distribution could begin in December. Bancel, the Moderna CEO, told Science that the company plans to charge $32 to $37 per dose of the vaccine in developed countries. But while the company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of 2020 for the US market, distributing the vaccine will be challenging.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine requires long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That\u2019s well within the temperature range of conventional refrigerators and warmer than the temperature requirements of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, but it may still pose a logistical hurdle in some lower-resource settings, like rural hospitals, that lack certain kinds of cold storage facilities.  Moderna\u2019s is also a two-dose vaccine, which means every recipient needs to come back for a second injection to get that high rate of efficacy. We know from other multi-dose vaccines that not everybody will return for that second shot \u2014 and the efficacy profile may look different. \u201cWhen you do an experiment, it\u2019s done under best conditions,\u201d Offit said. \u201cWhen things roll out in the real world, in real-world conditions, there\u2019s a fraying.\u201d  It\u2019s also important to remember that an effective vaccine is not enough to end the pandemic quickly. Measures like social distancing, practicing good hygiene, and wearing face masks will remain essential to control the spread of Covid-19 until a vaccine is widely available. Public acceptance may also be an issue, and health officials will have to overcome a rising wave of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine research also doesn\u2019t end once a vaccine is rolled out. Public health officials, doctors, and the biotech companies will still have to track complications across millions of people and pay attention to how quickly immunity wanes.  So far, we have two months of safety data after the second dose, and while that\u2019s not long-term, it should build confidence, Offit said. \u201cSerious side effects usually shot up within six weeks of the second dose. 260,000 people have died this year in the US [of Covid-19]. It would be great if we could do a three- to four-year study and look at length of efficacy and the duration of efficacy. But the question isn\u2019t when do you know everything here \u2014 it\u2019s when do you know enough.\u201d          ",

    "article_text": "The UK is the first country to grant emergency approval to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine  The United Kingdom on Wednesday granted temporary authorization for emergency use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to adults age 16 and older, with the first 800,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine slated to be offered in the country next week.  This makes the UK the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine and the first government approval of a vaccine backed by a clinical trial. (Some countries like Russia and China began administering their Covid-19 vaccines before completing large-scale trials.) It\u2019s also the fastest a vaccine has ever gained approval, albeit on a temporary basis.  \u201cI\u2019m confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onward, things are going to be better,\u201d said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a press conference. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have summer next year that everyone can enjoy.\u201d The UK\u2019s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), granted the temporary authorization shortly after Pfizer and BioNTech reported in November that their Covid-19 vaccine was 95 percent effective. Though this is a temporary authorization, the MHRA is conducting a rolling review of vaccine trial data as it comes in and may grant full approval at a later date. In contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating vaccines based on completed studies, which increases the length of the approval process. The UK government reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech to purchase 40 million doses of the vaccine through 2021 \u2014 enough for 20 million people \u2014 mainly shipped from Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium.  \u201cThis authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,\u201d said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in a statement.  The UK has been one of the most severely afflicted countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 1.6 million reported infections and almost 60,000 deaths in a population of 66 million. The government recently imposed a second national lockdown as cases spiked; restrictions on movement and which businesses can stay open may begin to relax this week as the number of new cases declines. But with winter approaching, the risk of more Covid-19 spread in the UK remains high.  With limited doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to give out for the time being, the UK is establishing several priority tiers for Covid-19 immunization.  The country\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday laid out guidelines for administering the vaccine based mainly on age. The top priority is residents and workers at care homes for older adults, a ranking based on the number of vaccinations that would be needed in each tier to prevent one death, not necessarily risk of exposure.  That\u2019s why health workers, who will be at the front of the line in the US, are not in the top tier in the UK, even though they may be encountering the virus more frequently. \u201cAs the risk of mortality from COVID-19 increases with age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,\u201d according to the guidelines. The committee divided its overall priority list into nine groups. \u201cIt is estimated that taken together, these groups represent around 99% of preventable mortality from COVID-19,\u201d according to the JCVI guidelines.  But the guidelines also note that vaccine deployment strategies may have to shift to address concerns like mitigating health inequalities and logistical challenges. The latter is particularly important for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because it has some of the most stringent cold storage requirements of any Covid-19 vaccine candidate: temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. While Pfizer and BioNTech are developing shipping containers that can maintain these temperatures for 30 days, it\u2019s likely that the first facilities to receive it will be major health facilities that already have freezers.  Recipients will have to receive the vaccine as two doses spaced 21 days apart, so rigorous patient tracking will be needed as well.   Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week voted on US guidelines for vaccine approval. The recommendations from the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices stated that health workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be up first for a Covid-19 vaccine. That health workers are in the top tier stands in contrast to the guidelines issued by the UK.  Establishing these priorities is all the more critical now that a vaccine is poised to begin distribution in the US in weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech have also applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US from the FDA for their Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA is meeting on December 10 to discuss their vaccine. This week, Moderna, another mRNA Covid-19 vaccine developer, also applied for an EUA.  If granted, these emergency approvals would mark the fastest vaccine development timeline ever, an amazing feat against an unprecedented pandemic. But Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise across the US, and it will still be a few more months before there is widespread access to a vaccine.    ",

    "article_text": "The exponential rise in Covid-19 hospitalizations, in one chart Far more Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19 than at any other point in the pandemic, a grim indicator that the third big wave of cases in the US is the worst wave to date by a lot. On December 2, 100,226 people across the United States were in the hospital after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, according to data reported by the Covid Tracking Project. That\u2019s significantly higher than the last two peaks recorded on April 15 and July 23, when the New York City and the Southeast and Southwest, respectively, were epicenters of the US outbreak. (As the Covid Tracking Project notes, the national and state hospital data have been erratic and incomplete, and reported totals may continue to shift.) What\u2019s clear from the data is that Covid-19 migrated across the country to new regions this fall. In the spring, hospitalizations were overwhelmingly concentrated in the Northeast. In the summer, more than half of hospitalized Covid-19 patients were in the South and West: states like Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. Now, every state is battling an active outbreak, and many of them are severe. \u201cThere\u2019s so many places, with so many people, that the numbers are just drastically higher,\u201d said Daniel McQuillen, an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts and a senior physician in the division of infectious diseases at Beth Israel Lahey Health, at a November Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing. \u201cThere are no more hot spots,\u201d said Murtaza Akhter, an emergency medicine physician with Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona. \u201cEverywhere is a hot spot.\u201d As of December 3, California had the highest number of hospitalizations of any state (9,702), and Texas was in second place with 9,151 people in the hospital; Midwestern states like Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio have also seen record spikes in cases in recent weeks and now have more than 4,000 people hospitalized each.  \u201cThe hospitalization number is the best indicator of where we are,\u201d Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told Vox this summer. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a better measurement of the severity of the pandemic than Covid-19 testing, which only finds a fraction of cases and includes more mild cases. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to new heights in the pandemic that we haven\u2019t seen before. Not that what we saw before wasn\u2019t horrifying enough.\u201d Some states like Utah and North Dakota have lower total hospitalizations but also fewer hospitals and hospital beds \u2014 and they\u2019re now reaching a woeful tipping point of hospitals stretched to maximum capacity. \u201cHere in Salt Lake City, we provide a lot of [specialized infectious disease and ICU care] to people in four states as far away as Montana, Arizona, and Wyoming ... and our hospitals and caregivers are extraordinarily stressed,\u201d Andrew Pavia, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said at the IDSA briefing. \u201cOur ICUs are full, but that includes overflow ICUs that have been purpose-built, taking advantage of the time we\u2019ve had to plan.\u201d This was, unfortunately, to be expected (although it wasn\u2019t inevitable). As the weather has turned cooler and states failed to fully control their outbreaks, transmission picked up when people moved indoors. Nearly all the states currently experiencing an increase in new cases and hospitalizations also did not experience major outbreaks in the spring or summer, so residents were less fearful and took less action to prevent the spread of the virus.  \u201cThere was a political climate where there\u2019s distrust of government and reluctance to take harsh measures\u201d in places like Utah, Pavia said. \u201cMany of these states did not have mask mandates until very recently, and some don\u2019t even have them today and have very limited restrictions on mass gatherings.\u201d Deaths have nearly hit a new record high as well, reaching 2,733 on December 2, reversing a steady decline that had begun in early May after the first wave and in August after the second wave. Cumulatively, 13.9 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic began, and more than 267,000 of them have died. With hospitalizations surging and several states reporting thousands of new cases a day, CDC Director Robert Redfield said Wednesday Americans are in for \u201cthe most difficult in the public health history of this nation.\u201d  The new hospitalizations, and the untenable pressure they\u2019re putting on the health care system, are also a reminder of how critical it is for states to implement and enforce measures like mandatory face masks, restrictions on bars and restaurants, and for the federal government to fix testing and contact tracing problems. \u201cIt should be an all-points bulletin to really bear down on this, because otherwise there\u2019s no limit on where this might go,\u201d said Topol. The good news is that infectious disease experts think many hospitals are better prepared to handle surges in Covid-19 patients than they were in the spring. For the most part, they have the equipment they need and they know how to deploy it. They also have more standardized protocol for treating the sickest patients. Yet hospitals in hot spots across the country are maxing out their staff, equipment, and beds, with doctors and nurses warning that the worst-case scenario of hospital resources being overwhelmed have already arrived as their states have failed to get control of the coronavirus.  \u201cThe surge of Covid-19 patients takes away from our ability to care for the sick patients that are already in Arkansas,\u201d said a nurse at a major health system in Little Rock, who asked to go unnamed fearing retaliation from her employer. \u201cWe have so many nurses quarantined that we\u2019re not able to staff our oncology unit appropriately, and our patients are being negatively affected. Covid-19 is right now overburdening our health care system in Arkansas.\u201d Hospitals in several states are also straining to find enough specialists to treat very sick Covid-19 patients.  \u201cICU beds don\u2019t take care of people \u2014 you need staff,\u201d Pavia said. \u201cAnd one of the things that many of the Western states have in common is a relative shortage of the people we need to take care of very sick people during a pandemic like this: ICU doctors, probably most importantly ICU nurses, and infectious disease physicians, respiratory therapists. These folks have been working flat out for eight or nine months, and three months into the surge, they\u2019re exhausted, they\u2019re stressed.\u201d  Staffing is a universal problem in hot spots. Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah said the state will have to bring in out-of-state nurses to help with the surge, and officials and health care providers in South Dakota, Tennessee, Arizona, and Wisconsin are requesting them too In Texas, officials are setting up medical tents in El Paso and Lubbock in response to the rapid rise in hospitalized Covid-19 patients and a dwindling number of hospital beds. \u201cEl Paso, Texas, is almost completely out of ICU beds; Lubbock, the same thing,\u201d said McQuillen. \u201cWe are the 11th-largest city in the state of Texas and we have two field hospitals on their way to town,\u201d Jarrett Atkinson, Lubbock\u2019s city manager, told KCBD in November. \u201cI can absolutely assure you that never in my career did I think we would be deploying field hospitals to Lubbock, Texas.\u201d According to McQuillen, both El Paso and Lubbock have been \u201cmuch less stringent with their populations [mandating] simple things like wearing masks, and socially distancing.\u201d He compared that to Massachusetts and other Northeast states where he says strict measures during the spring surge made a big difference in reversing the steep climb in cases and hospitalizations. Yet too many states ignored that critical lesson, and now are paying the price. While daily Covid-19 hospitalizations are surging, another key metric, daily deaths, reached 2,733 on December 2, the highest it has been since April during the first surge, according to the Covid Tracking Project. It\u2019s an ominous sign that deaths will reach horrifying new levels in the coming weeks and months, given that cases and hospitalizations are now at new highs. It\u2019s possible, experts say, that fewer people who are hospitalized will end up dying in this winter stage of the pandemic as compared to the spring. As Vox\u2019s Julia Belluz reported, there have been significant improvements in mortality in the US and Europe in the past several months, as doctors\u2019 understanding of Covid-19 and how to treat it has improved: That said, if hospitals in the hard-hit states run out of beds and staff to treat the incoming flow of patients, more people who could have been saved may die. When ICU staff were stretched in the spring, \u201cICU patients just didn\u2019t get the same attention,\u201d intensive care doctor Lakshman Swamy, who works with the Cambridge Health Alliance, told Belluz. Murtaza Akhter, the Arizona doctor, worries that his emergency room will be completely overwhelmed around Christmas, about one month after Thanksgiving, when many people are expected to have been infected after ignoring or the public health guidance to avoid family gatherings. He says he\u2019s most worried about the \u201cborderline patients who may otherwise have been admitted to the ER \u2014 they may now be more likely to go home because there are no hospital beds. And of those people, a very distinct fraction will have a worse outcome.\u201d  This is one big reason why overtaxed hospitals will lead to more deaths. \u201cThis Covid-19 surge really has a huge downstream effect everywhere, not just on Covid patients but everybody else because it\u2019s not like car accidents magically stopped or heart attacks stopped, they\u2019re still there. The ones who do come in and get discharged, more often than many get worse outcomes.\u201d    ",

    "article_text": "Joe Biden is taking office amid a poverty crisis Poverty actually fell in early to mid-2020, as the pandemic took hold, due to an unprecedented expansion of government safety net programs. But it has since grown and surpassed its early 2020 level, and is poised to increase more if the economic situation remains dire. Those are the major findings from projections made by researchers at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University, who have been developing methods for monthly estimates of poverty during the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers \u2014 Zach Parolin, Chris Wimer, Jane Waldfogel, Jordan Matsudaira, and Megan Curran \u2014 use a metric known as the \u201csupplemental poverty measure,\u201d designed as a more consistent and reliable measure of hardship than the official poverty measure used by US government programs. Their metric is hardly perfect \u2014 critics argue it \u201cdefines poverty down\u201d by setting too low an income threshold \u2014 but it\u2019s useful for tracking variations like those experienced during the Covid-19 crisis.  According to their data, 15.5 percent of Americans, or 50.3 million people, were living in poverty in January 2020, before the coronavirus crisis began in earnest. In April, after relief measures began, the rate was down to 13.9 percent. The crisis continued, but many relief measures did not. The $1,200 \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d (a.k.a. stimulus checks) were a one-off. The $600-per-week boost to unemployment insurance expired at the end of July. And poverty began creeping back up again, reaching 17.3 percent in August, and 16.7 percent, or about 54.2 million people, in September.  In other words, about 4 million more people were in poverty by September than were at the beginning of 2020. That\u2019s a quite large degradation in living standards. Looking ahead to January 2021 requires making some assumptions about unemployment. The rate as of October was 6.9 percent, a swift improvement from the peak of 14.7 percent in April. But it\u2019s still nearly double what it was in February before the crisis. The Columbia researchers\u2019 findings confirm that the January 2021 poverty situation will depend heavily on unemployment. They find that even if unemployment falls to 5 percent, which would be a big improvement, poverty will rise modestly from 16.7 percent in September to 17 percent in January, putting another 1 million or so people in poverty for a total of 55.2 million. If, on the other hand, unemployment remains elevated, the situation gets substantially worse. If it ticks up to 7.5 percent, then poverty will reach 18.1 percent, or 58.8 million people. If the situation deteriorates substantially and unemployment rises to 10 percent again, then poverty will rise to 19.1 percent of Americans \u2014 62.1 million. The upshot is this: Depending on the scale of the broader economic recovery, between 4.9 million and 11.8 million more people will be living in poverty in January 2021 than were in January 2020. This is a large increase even compared to the Great Recession. The same Columbia research group estimates that from 2007 to 2011, poverty measured the same way rose from 14.4 percent to 16.1 percent of the population, a 1.7-point increase. The best-case scenario of 5 percent unemployment in January 2021, by comparison, registers as a 1.5-point increase in poverty, similar in scale to the Great Recession. If we don\u2019t get down to 5 percent unemployment, the effects could be worse than the Great Recession. The Columbia team is not the only group of researchers attempting to track living standards for Americans in poverty on a monthly basis during this crisis. Jeehoon Han of Zhejiang University, Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago, and James X. Sullivan at the University of Notre Dame have their own set of real-time measures, and while they do not calculate projections for January 2021, they tell the same story as the Columbia researchers about what happened from January to October 2020. The poverty rate, as they measure it, fell from 10.9 percent in January/February to 9.4 percent in April/May/June (they average months in an attempt to minimize error). But it then ticked up dramatically, from 9.4 percent to 11.3 percent in September and October. \u201cNearly 7 million have been added to the ranks of the poor since May,\u201d the researchers write in their most recent release. \u201cPoverty appears to have risen in October even though the unemployment rate fell by more than a percentage point.\u201d  That disconnect is partially a temporary result of the expiration of aid programs \u2014 but if it holds, then poverty could rise even more with falling unemployment than the Columbia numbers suggest. One thing to keep in mind when interpreting these two sets of numbers is that the Columbia team defines people and households as \u201cin poverty\u201d if they fall below a certain income threshold (adjusted for cost of living in their area and a few other factors) during a particular month. That has advantages, particularly during a rapidly evolving crisis like this one, but also disadvantages: It only counts tax credits, for instance, as income for the month when a person\u2019s tax refund is delivered. So if a low-income worker got a large earned income tax credit (EITC) in March, that counts as a several-thousand-dollar windfall for just that month \u2014 which helps explain why the Columbia measure sees poverty falling in March, even before Covid-19 relief measures were implemented. The Zhejiang/Chicago/Notre Dame team, by contrast, uses an annual reference period: It is trying to estimate how many people fell below a certain income level in the past 12 months. That gets around problems like the EITC but might make income fluctuations look smaller than they feel: If you lost all your pay in April, that would only show up as an 8 percent fall in your annual income, measured from the previous April. On a monthly basis, though, your income fell 100 percent. Another indication of an increase in that kind of short-run need is the nationwide surge in demand for supplies from food banks. A report from Hunger Free America found that in New York City, food pantries and soup kitchens fed 65.1 percent more people in 2020 than in 2019; that\u2019s compared to a 10 percent increase in people served the year before. The Greater Boston Food Bank told the Boston Globe that it went from distributing 1 million pounds of food per week to 415,000 people pre-pandemic to 2.5 million pounds per week to over 660,000 people.  The St. Louis Area Foodbank in Missouri reports that it went from distributing 3.1 million meals a month pre-pandemic to 5 million meals a month now. In Grand Rapids, the South Michigan Food Bank reported distributing more food in October than it had in any prior month in its 38-year history, covering both the early 1980s recession and the Great Recession. Underlying these trends is an increase in food insecurity, which is closely linked to income poverty. One of the first tasks the Biden administration will face in January is crafting a stimulus package that will pick up where the package that expired at the end of July left off. The expiration of the $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefit appears to have substantially increased need and poverty at the low end, and reviving a bonus benefit and providing other income support policies will be critical for avoiding further increases in poverty and returning the poverty rate to where it was in January 2020, if not lower. President-elect Biden has outlined what his preferred stimulus package would look like in considerable detail. It includes extending the $600-per-week unemployment insurance bonus; extensive aid to state, local, and tribal governments; and a $250-per-child monthly allowance for families, boosted to $300 per month per child for kids under 6. But congressional Democrats have struggled to get a deal matching these parameters through the Republican-controlled Senate, or even a more limited one with, say, $400 per week in bonus UI payments. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on a lower-cost package that includes civil immunity for businesses that put people at risk of Covid-19 infection. McConnell is likely to hold that line if he controls the Senate under Biden; control of the Senate will be determined in two Georgia runoff elections on January 5. The main challenge for policymakers interested in poverty alleviation, then, will be convincing McConnell and his allies to support stimulus and income support at the level that\u2019s needed to reverse the increase in poverty.

    "article_text": "The pandemic was great for Zoom. What happens when there\u2019s a vaccine? If 2020 was the year Zoom rode the pandemic to skyrocketing success, 2021 could be the year the videoconferencing company comes back down to Earth. Zoom started trading on the stock market in April 2019. At the time, it was known for being a rarity: a newly public tech company that actually turned a profit. One year later, the world was in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic, and Zoom went from being a niche business software popular among tech companies to the way people did just about everything.  Not only did that mean a sharp rise in Zoom meetings for the millions newly working from home, but also Zoom birthdays and baby showers for everyone else. For many, it became an indispensable lifeline to the outside world, with a free option that limited calls to 40 minutes and an unlimited paid option that enabled people to do many of the things they used to do in person. As people joked at the time: Having a corporate Zoom account was the new having a car. It was one of several videoconferencing options already out there, but it captured the public imagination and market share more than most. Zoom became a verb. The reason? It just worked.  Zoom has grown years in just months. At this time last year, Zoom had on average 10 million daily meeting participants. It now has 350 million. Zoom was the most-downloaded iPhone and iPad app of the year, beating perennial favorites like Instagram and YouTube. The company\u2019s revenue is four times what it was in 2019. Now, as we close in on two years since Zoom\u2019s public debut, numerous headwinds make the company\u2019s future less certain. Giant software companies like Microsoft, Cisco, and Google have mostly caught up on video chat technology, offering vastly better products than they did before Zoom entered the scene. What\u2019s more, businesses that are cutting costs during a recession are less amenable to additional spending on software when they can lean on the contracts they already have. Microsoft Teams, which has a Zoom-like videoconferencing feature, is essentially free for companies paying for Microsoft\u2019s Office suite. Slack, another best-of-breed workplace app that was acquired by Salesforce this week, also comes with a video component. Perhaps most pressing, with multiple viable coronavirus vaccines likely to start distribution, we might not need to video chat so much next year. Zoom\u2019s stock dropped nearly 20 percent in November after the news that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was highly effective in late-stage trials. It\u2019s still up nearly 500 percent from this time last year, and Zoom has more than quadrupled sales year over year.  Zoom, for its part, says it welcomes a vaccine, despite the stock dips.  \u201cHopefully we provide a good enough service \u2014 and it\u2019s my true intention that we provide a good enough service \u2014 that people want to use us, calamity or not,\u201d Aparna Bawa, Zoom\u2019s chief operating officer, told Recode. Just nine years ago, disaffected Webex engineer Eric Yuan left Cisco to found Zoom. Now, Zoom is not only more popular than Webex, a videoconferencing service that\u2019s been around since the 1990s, Zoom appears more popular than all of its competitors. But that enthusiasm among users hasn\u2019t translated to sales at the same scale.  US traffic to Zoom\u2019s website is nearly 30 times what it was in the beginning of the year, according to data from online analytics firm SimilarWeb. In October, monthly visits to Zoom were three times higher than visits to Google\u2019s Meet and Hangouts combined, according to the firm, which can\u2019t track web visits to Microsoft Teams because it doesn\u2019t have its own domain distinct from microsoft.com.  Zoom had double the number of app downloads in October as Google Hangouts, and four times as many as Microsoft Teams or Google Meet. But Zoom downloads have slowed from highs earlier in the pandemic. \u201cCustomers are still using the platform, you\u2019re just not seeing the volume of new customers coming on as it was in the past six months,\u201d Charlie Rogers, a software research analyst at 7Park Data, told Recode. \u201cA lot of customers who would buy Zoom have already got it.\u201d  In other words, Zoom might be nearing market saturation because so many people already have an account. And being popular with the masses doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to more income, especially since Zoom has a popular free tier with a 40-minute call limit as well as free unlimited usage for K-12 students. Corporate users are more likely to have the paid version \u2014 and they\u2019re less likely to turn off their service, when, say, a vaccine makes it possible to meet people in person.  Zoom\u2019s largest revenue segment \u2014 62 percent \u2014 comes from companies with more than 10 employees, but customers with 10 or fewer employees are growing much faster, making up 38 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, up from 20 percent at the end of last year. That segment of customers has grown as more individuals have adopted the paid service, but it\u2019s also a more volatile segment because smaller customers can switch to a service offered by one of Zoom\u2019s competitors more easily. Last quarter, 18 percent of total revenue came from customers spending $100,000 or more, down from 33 percent at the end of last year. \u201cThe real jewel isn\u2019t about consumer or SMBs [small and medium-sized businesses], the real gold is to win enterprise,\u201d Ryan Koontz, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, told Recode. That\u2019s because each contract means numerous paid licenses within an organization as well as longer-term subscriptions. As Koontz put it, for enterprises, \u201cThe cost of change is very high.\u201d Put differently, Zoom competitors with an existing enterprise customer base have an advantage because those customers are more likely to stick with the same provider.  About half of companies surveyed by Enterprise Technology Research (ETR) have Zoom while 75 percent currently have Teams (many companies pay for multiple software subscriptions). Thirty percent have Cisco\u2019s Webex, after a recent decline. These numbers are still up for both products since the pandemic began. And when narrowing the data to bigger Fortune 500 companies, the market share for Teams and Webex rose this quarter, while Zoom\u2019s declined. Additionally, many companies that have Zoom are spending less on it. Microsoft Teams is the main reason company chief information officers cited for leaving or spending less with Zoom, according to ETR. (A number of CIOs cited security as another reason for leaving the service.) Many of those companies already pay for Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, which has business staples like Excel and Word. Included in the cost of the software suite is access to Microsoft Teams and its videoconferencing features, making Teams a no-brainer for companies trying to cut costs. This is an argument Zoom is used to. \u201cWhen Eric [Yuan] founded this company, videoconferencing was then thought of as a saturated market. There were lots of very large legacy providers including Microsoft that continued to bundle different services,\u201d Bawa said. \u201cAnd Zoom still has done pretty darn well.\u201d  Zoom still has plenty of enterprise users, and it\u2019s also popular among small businesses. While this smaller, fast-growing segment isn\u2019t as profitable as big companies, these customers are still important for Zoom\u2019s future.  \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the number of small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d Wayne Kurtzman, research director of social and collaboration at market research firm IDC, said. \u201cThe market has room for multiple leaders.\u201d While Zoom earned popularity because of its dependability and ease of use, its competitors have gotten a lot better in these respects by simplifying their services and bulking up the quality of their video calls. Now, the baseline service that Zoom and its competitors offer is pretty similar. They all have videoconferences that are pretty easy to join, work pretty well, and are pretty secure. So all these companies are currently fighting to differentiate themselves with new and better products.  This year, Zoom had to fix security concerns to bring its service more in line with its competitors. A series of high-profile security mishaps \u2014 including Zoombombing, a vulnerability that let websites hijack Mac cameras, and Zoom routing calls through China \u2014 eventually led Zoom to bulk up its security. In addition to fixing the issues that led to the mishaps, Zoom hired former Facebook security executive Alex Stamos as an outside consultant and began offering end-to-end encryption in October. \u201cZoom is catching up at a really quick rate to those like Teams and Webex,\u201d Frank Dickson, program vice president within IDC\u2019s cybersecurity products research practice, told Recode.  Bawa said Zoom\u2019s enterprise customers are a testament to the bolstered security.  \u201cThe validation is that we have a significant number of our large enterprise customers that go through multiple rounds of security review in financial services, in the government sector, defense \u2014 you name it \u2014 retail, etc.,\u201d Bawa said. \u201cAnd we have passed them and continue flourishing in those accounts, expanding our footprint.\u201d So now, the competitive battleground for videoconferencing software is all about new features. Both Microsoft Teams and Cisco\u2019s Webex have added at least 100 new features since the pandemic. They\u2019ve added noise cancellation software to deal with the sounds of working from home: babies crying, dogs barking, neighbors mowing their lawns. They also started offering live transcription. Microsoft introduced Together Mode, which places conference attendees against a shared digital background to give them the feeling of being in the same room. To accommodate its governmental customers, Webex even added a new feature that allows legislators to emulate voting on laws. \u201cA direct outcome of the pandemic was, hey, our innovation velocity has to increase because this has become a far more strategic technology today than it was five years ago,\u201d Jeetu Patel, senior vice president of security and apps at Webex, told Recode. Meanwhile, Facebook realized early in the pandemic that people were using its Portal video chat service more for group events than one-on-one conversations, so it made that easier with link sharing and call scheduling.  All of the platforms have enabled fun backgrounds and Snapchat-like augmented reality filters.  In addition to many of the same features as its competitors, Zoom has been rolling out new potential revenue streams. After launching Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone last year, Zoom announced more new products in October: OnZoom, a video events platform that will allow people to sell tickets, and Zoom Apps, which lets people navigate to other workplace apps like Dropbox and Slack within Zoom. Zoom sees these new products as commonsense additions to its core tool, which it says could still get better. But taken together, all of these moves could be a sign of weakness.  \u201cAnytime an enterprise tech company that\u2019s a one-trick pony announces new products, it\u2019s because the current product is maxed out,\u201d said market researcher Thomas DelVecchio. The end of the pandemic does not signify the end of video calls. It will certainly mean less video usage, but video will likely forevermore be a component of meetings, if not a dire necessity.  After the pandemic, the vast majority of office employers plan to use a hybrid work model, wherein some of their workforce works remotely at least some of the time. As large as it was this year \u2014 $7.9 billion \u2014 the videoconferencing market is expected to grow next year to an estimated $9.7 billion with 90 percent of North American businesses likely to spend more on it, according to IDC. The videoconferencing companies, in turn, are all looking forward to a time when meetings will happen naturally in person and remotely. They\u2019ll also have to make it natural for those physically present to communicate effectively with their remote counterparts, without one or the other feeling disadvantaged. Inevitably, video calls need to be more useful.  \u201cIt needs to be more than a meeting,\u201d said IDC\u2019s Kurtzman. \u201cIt needs to add more value.\u201d That will include using augmented reality to make meetings more engaging and viewing data together as a group more useful. It will also require setting up video calls to become even simpler and more seamless than they are now. \u201cVideoconferencing in seven years will seem unrecognizable from the videoconferencing we have today,\u201d Kurtzman said. \u201cThe features and ways of engaging many people would classify as science fiction today.\u201d  Companies are approaching the future from varying angles. Going forward, Microsoft is investing heavily in features that contribute to employees\u2019 sense of wellbeing, as their research shows working during the pandemic has had deleterious effects on employees, including an increased number of meetings and longer hours. Cisco is soon launching a feature meant to guarantee that everyone in a meeting feels they can participate, by allotting each participant time to speak in which the others are muted. Facebook expects video to become an additive element to regular life.  \u201cI can see every wedding happening going forward having a Portal device in the front row,\u201d Micah Collins, director of product management for Facebook\u2019s Portal, said. And now that these legacy software companies are paying such close attention to the videoconference space, it will be difficult for Zoom to keep up and continue to differentiate itself. Its founder has suggested that Zoom could be the center of a more human communications system. \u201cEric at one point said, \u2018I want you to be able to reach through Zoom and shake someone\u2019s hand or give each other a hug over Zoom,\u2019\u201d Bawa said. \u201cWe view ourselves as the conduit to providing human-to-human connection in any context in a very intimate and personal way.\u201d If Zoom can pull it off, that could be the difference between a company on the rise and one crashing back to Earth.",

    "article_text": "America\u2019s failures have led to a new daily record in Covid-19 deaths On December 2, a staggering 2,885 Americans were reported to have died of Covid-19, according to the New York Times. It was the highest single-day toll of the year. It was nearly the same number of people who died in the 9/11 attacks (2,977). And it was far more than the estimated 1,800 Americans who died over a matter of days when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. During World War II, from the Pearl Harbor attacks in December 1941 to Japan\u2019s surrender, about 300 US soldiers died every day on average (and about 407,000 were dead in total by August 1945). Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has more in common with a slow-motion tragedy, like a war, than an acute event like 9/11. More than 2,600 deaths were reported on December 1, the day before the US set its new record for daily deaths; the previous high had been 2,752 on April 15. With the number of daily new cases and hospitalizations still rising across the country, public health experts expect new terrible death records will be set over the coming winter. Coronavirus pandemic metrics are slippery things, however. America was so bad at testing during the first few months of the virus\u2019s spread that there were likely quite a few cases and deaths that were caused by Covid-19 but were not counted as such. Even today, the US positive test rate is so high that experts say the statistics aren\u2019t coming close to capturing every case or death.  According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the official number of total deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US is 274,121. But total excess deaths \u2014 the number of deaths above what would be expected in a normal year \u2014 has reached 345,000, according to the Times. Most, though not all, of those deaths are likely uncounted Covid-19 fatalities. At a certain point, this is all academic. What\u2019s undeniable is that America is entering a period of mass death unlike anything we\u2019ve seen so far in the pandemic. Cases and hospitalizations have been rising steadily, and deaths always follow. Improvements in treatment have lowered the fatality rate, but a higher number of hospitalized patients will inevitably mean more deaths. And it is older, low-income, and minority Americans who are dying at disproportionate rates from the coronavirus. The US also set a new single-day record for current hospitalizations on December 2, topping 100,000 for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Hospitals all across the nation are under tremendous strain.  As hospital beds fill up and staff is stretched thin, the likelihood of losing people who otherwise might have survived under normal circumstances increases. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, explained the risks in a recent Twitter thread. He started by pointing out that the percentage of new Covid-19 cases who end up in the hospital is actually shrinking. That would suggest people who would have been hospitalized earlier in the year are now being turned away from the emergency room or asked to stay at home because they\u2019re not yet in critical condition.  Some of this is good public health practice \u2014 you want to keep beds open for the sickest patients \u2014 but it also creates a situation where somebody who\u2019s at the margins could be denied entry to the hospital and their condition might deteriorate more quickly at home. Full hospitals could also be left without enough room or staff for patients with other serious conditions, and some of those people could die without access to the medical care they need. They may not die of Covid-19, but they would still be victims of the pandemic. On Twitter, Kari Jerge, a surgeon in Kansas City, Kansas, described recent dilemmas doctors are facing: a non-Covid patient who died because he needed an emergency kidney replacement with a dialysis machine but there were no nurses available to run the machine, and having to turn down a transfer of another patient in critical condition because there were no ICU beds left. This is likely only going to get worse over the holiday season. Many states and cities still refuse to take the mitigation measures necessary to control the virus, even though none of them meet the benchmarks for safely staying open. Vox\u2019s German Lopez painted the grim picture in his most recent update on how each state is faring in containing the coronavirus: There is still time to soften the blow, with states and cities implementing more social distancing restrictions and requiring better mask adherence. But barring a sudden change in public behavior and public policy, America\u2019s outbreak is not going to get better anytime soon.  At this point, we appear to be waiting for the vaccine to be widely distributed to bring the virus under control \u2014 something that may not happen for another six months or longer. Prioritizing the most vulnerable populations for vaccination should help reduce the death toll, but there is no avoiding the fact that tens of thousands of Americans are likely to die over the next few months. CDC Director Robert Redfield said on Wednesday that the US Covid-19 death toll could reach 450,000 by March 1 without better social distancing and mask-wearing. That would mean about 175,000 more deaths between now and then. In that scenario, the number of Americans who died of Covid-19 would surpass the number of American soldiers who died in all of World War II \u2014 and across a much shorter time frame (about one year versus four). In terms of mass-death events in America\u2019s history, the coronavirus pandemic would rank behind only the Civil War and the 1918 flu pandemic. As other parts of the developed world celebrate the complete eradication of the virus, America is still reaching the worst kind of milestones. And there are more to come.",

    "article_text": "Why the CDC changed its Covid-19 quarantine guidelines The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested on Wednesday that some people who have been exposed to Covid-19 can quarantine for less than two weeks. The agency said a 14-day quarantine, in which people stay home and avoid interacting with others, is still the safest option if they come into close contact \u2014 within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes \u2014 with someone who has Covid-19. Anyone who actually contracts the disease should self-isolate until at least 10 days after symptoms begin, and not leave isolation until their fever is gone for at least 24 hours. But the CDC updated its guidelines  \u2014 which are recommendations, not legal requirements \u2014 to offer \u201calternatives.\u201d People who\u2019ve been in close contact with someone with Covid-19 should still quarantine. But that quarantine can end after 10 days without a coronavirus test. Or it can last seven days if someone obtains a negative test result, which they\u2019re advised to get as early as day five of quarantine. People should watch out for symptoms for 14 days after quarantine.  Public health experts described the change as a harm reduction move: It\u2019s not ideal for people to cut their quarantine time short. But if the change lets more people quarantine for some period of time, that could be better overall. \u201cThe new guidelines are an example of a harm reduction approach, or one that takes into account the challenges individuals might face in reducing risks,\u201d Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. \u201cMy main concern, however, is about potential confusion, and the need for strong, clear messaging. CDC is still recommending 14-day quarantine \u2014 that should not be lost here.\u201d The CDC hinted at that, citing the possibilities of \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d and \u201cstress on the public health system\u201d due to 14-day quarantines.  \u201cCDC continues to endorse quarantine for 14 days and recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus,\u201d the agency said. The incubation period for Covid-19 can be up to two weeks \u2014 perhaps even longer in rare cases \u2014 suggesting that people can\u2019t say they\u2019re fully in the clear until a 14-day quarantine is up.  But for most people, the incubation period is now believed to be \u201cskewed toward the shorter end of that\u201d 14-day window, Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage said. So most people likely can cut their quarantine time short without posing a risk to others. The change comes at a particularly calamitous time. Cases in the US are continuing to rise, regularly breaking records. Hospitalizations surpassed 100,000 for the first time this week. The daily death toll is now regularly above 2,000 \u2014 levels of death not seen since the initial spring outbreaks. And things are bound to get worse. Thanks to the virus\u2019s incubation period, and the fact that most people are sick for potentially weeks before hospitalization or death, we still haven\u2019t seen the effects of Thanksgiving gatherings last week. The US could have record-breaking levels of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, right as people go on to gather for Christmas and New Year\u2019s \u2014 further spreading the virus in sustained, intimate settings. Meanwhile, a vaccine is likely still months away for most Americans. The CDC\u2019s new quarantine guidance is an attempt to get Americans to do something, even as many of them resist taking the other steps the agency has called for. If it works, it could help combat just how bad things get in the next few weeks. In public health, \u201charm reduction\u201d means acknowledging that people are going to take risks, but still trying to make their behavior as safe as possible. People could eliminate their risk of sexually transmitted infections, for example, by never having sex at all \u2014 but given that people are going to have sex, public health officials try to encourage people to do it safely, by using condoms and having fewer partners. As we\u2019ve gotten more evidence on how the coronavirus spreads, and as the public has become fatigued with the pandemic and more resistant to tougher measures, health officials have increasingly taken a harm reduction approach to fighting Covid-19.  \u201cWhile we might like to imagine we can instantaneously halt all transmission, in reality we are working to prevent as much as possible, which can sometimes involve trade-offs,\u201d Hanage said. While it\u2019s better if people from different households don\u2019t socialize \u2014 since any interaction carries a risk of transmission \u2014 officials have tried to push people toward safer interactions in outdoor environments where the virus can\u2019t spread as easily. The same impulse drives the push to wear masks: Maybe people shouldn\u2019t get their hair cut at all if they want to eliminate the risk of Covid-19, but if they\u2019re going to, they can at least mitigate the risk of transmission with masks. At a press conference announcing the new recommendations, CDC officials were clear that they would still prefer people quarantine for a full 14 days after exposure. But given the constraints people can face, including the need to work, and the more recent evidence that the incubation period may not be two weeks for most people, the CDC is now trying to offer some flexibility. \u201cWe can safely reduce the length of quarantine, but accepting that there is a small residual risk that a person who is leaving quarantine early could transmit to someone else if they became infected,\u201d John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC\u2019s Covid-19 response, said. It\u2019s not perfect. With the CDC\u2019s new guidance, some coronavirus infections will likely sneak through that could have been prevented by a 14-day quarantine. But if the guidance stops more infections overall by getting more people to quarantine, even for a less-than-perfect amount of time, that\u2019s still a net benefit in reducing transmission. This is, in other words, about striking a balance between the ideal steps to stop Covid-19 and people\u2019s willingness to actually follow those steps. A big risk with the CDC\u2019s guidance is there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Covid-19. We\u2019re still learning a lot of the basics about the coronavirus and the disease it causes, from how long incubation lasts to the wide range of symptoms to its long-term effects. It\u2019s still not certain how much transmission is driven by people who never experience symptoms, and that could pose a challenge for the CDC\u2019s guidance if it turns out a lot of people leave their quarantine early \u2014 at the new 10-day cutoff, for example \u2014 but are able to spread the virus, unknowingly, to others. On the other hand, there are also studies showing that people may not be infectious for as long as previously thought. So it could turn out that the CDC\u2019s new guidance is too lax, just like it could also be that the agency\u2019s guidelines are still generally too strict. Some experts were critical about the CDC\u2019s guidance, calling for more clarity or tweaks to the recommendations. Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist, told me she\u2019s concerned that the agency said people can get a test as early as day five of quarantine and use test results to stop quarantining after day seven. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to see testing on day six or seven and then end of quarantine when the result comes back negative,\u201d Popescu said. Still, experts were overall receptive to the change, with Popescu noting that \u201cit can help get more compliance for quarantine.\u201d But, she cautioned, the CDC and other officials should be clear about the limitations and a continued need for other steps, like social distancing when possible and masking. The big risk, for now, is the US is still in the middle of a massive Covid-19 outbreak \u2014 one of the worst in the world. In that environment, every single interaction outside of your home is a potential risk for transmission. There\u2019s simply too much virus out there, making it easy for people to spread it. Despite these circumstances, public health officials have also had to wrestle with the fact that people aren\u2019t listening. For weeks, experts and officials were advising people not to travel for Thanksgiving. Then the country set records for pandemic-era airline travel last week. The same now seems likely to happen again with Christmas and New Year\u2019s, bringing new superspreading events as the country deals with record highs for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Given that reality, the CDC is trying to meet people where they are: If individuals are going to do things officials prefer they don\u2019t do, they can at least take some measures \u2014 even a reduced quarantine time period \u2014 to help slow spread as much as possible. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s where the country is at.",

    "article_text": "Decking the halls for pandemic Christmas A 9-foot nutcracker. Magic crystals that light up a fireplace with green and purple flames. Glass-glitter pinecones so sharp, they have to be handled with protective gear. These are just some of the decorations that Christmas enthusiasts are using to show their holiday cheer in an otherwise dreary year. Dorinda Medley, a former star of Bravo\u2019s The Real Housewives of New York City, is known for \u201cmaking it nice,\u201d especially the exuberant Christmas displays she installs each year at Blue Stone Manor, her home in the Berkshires. But she\u2019s going extra-big this holiday season \u2014 literally, if that giant nutcracker she bought is any indication. \u201cWhen I pressed the button, I was like, \u2018What have I done?\u2019 But now it\u2019s on the American Express, paid for, and I\u2019m happy for it,\u201d Medley says. Being happy for it, for small pockets of merriment in a time when everything seems not very merry, is adding up to big business for purveyors of Christmas decor, who are selling holiday cheer at a fast clip. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put in the effort this year,\u201d Medley says of her big spending, \u201cbecause it would be easy just to fall into the doldrums of 2020 and say forget it. But I think that, at the end of the day, people need to feel hopeful.\u201d Medley is not alone. In this year of diminished holiday celebrations, with many skipping the holidays entirely and others doing their best to adjust traditions to fit the safety measures called for by the Covid-19 pandemic, Christmas enthusiasts are choosing to redirect energy they would usually spend on parties, meals, and frantic shopping trips to putting up over-the-top decorations and light displays. Celebrants are expressing holiday cheer inside as well, through old-fashioned Yuletide activities like gingerbread-house building and garland-stringing as people seek out what Medley describes as a Norman Rockwell-esque Christmas. \u201cI want to evoke that feeling of home \u2014 because we\u2019ve all been home,\u201d she says. (It doesn\u2019t hurt, of course, that Christmas crafts are highly, highly Instagrammable.) It\u2019s a scene that is playing out across the country. \u201cOver the last two months, we\u2019ve seen a 45 percent increase in holiday lighting over the same time frame last year, and a 42 percent increase with wreaths and garland,\u201d says Andrew Wolf, a holiday merchant at Ace Hardware. And John DeCosmo, president of Ulta-Lit Tree Company, says, \u201cLight sets sales are up, outdoor decor sales are up, and artificial Christmas tree sales are up, so yes, we are seeing it. Our own sales online are up over 30 percent this year.\u201d Caroline Moss, an author and host of the podcast Gee Thanks Just Bought It, is doing an outdoor lights display for the first time and saw no reason to wait until after Thanksgiving to illuminate her home. \u201cI put up an outdoor tree and outdoor lights on November 2,\u201d she confesses. Moss, who relocated to Los Angeles this year with her husband Dan, was concerned about what her new neighbors might think, though she needn\u2019t have worried. \u201cI was very nervous because I didn\u2019t want to be seen as the crazy new neighbors. I texted my next-door neighbor, and she was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re doing it too.\u2019\u201d According to DeCosmo, the day after Thanksgiving is typically the most popular day of the year for Christmas decorating. But this year, people like Moss got an early start, perhaps wanting to wear their holiday cheer on their lawns. Bronson van Wyck, a decorator who services a high-end clientele, saw a noted increase in business \u2014 especially among early birds. \u201cWe would typically do somewhere between six to 10 homes for Christmas, and we would probably have booked them by about [mid-November],\u201d he says. \u201cThis year we had a dozen bookings before Labor Day.\u201d Van Wyck is capitalizing in another way: For $475, his website offers something called a \u201cSugar and Spice, Sensory Delights Package\u201d featuring \u201c(1) Evergreen, cedar and juniper wreath adorned with dried citrus, cinnamon stick and faux berries hand-crafted by genuine Van Wyck Elves,\u201d a full-color smart LED light bulb from GE, and a tube of those magic crystals for tossing in the fire (Amazon retail price: $15.26). Van Wyck isn\u2019t the only one trotting out elves. On the new Netflix show Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas, interior designer Benjamin Bradley, the titular Mr. Christmas, and his team (yes, of elves) gives four families holiday home makeovers that feature hand-flocked trees, Della Robbia-style wreaths, lucite diamonds, hanging lanterns, and luminescent deer. Mr. Christmas, in his own words, goes \u201cChristmas balls to the walls.\u201d Preston Davis, the editor of Keep it Chic, is another newcomer to festive outdoor holiday displays. \u201cI have never put lights outside or in windows and I plan to do that this year! I think it\u2019s important to show that we are here, we\u2019re celebrating,\u201d Davis says.  In holiday seasons past, Davis hosted a series of luncheons to visit with old friends returning home for the holidays. But with travel and large gatherings off the table, Davis is thinking about building a gingerbread house and making old-fashioned popcorn garland with her adult daughters, ages 20 and 25 \u2014 provided they\u2019re able to safely travel home. \u201cI plan on really ramping up, the tree with the popcorn strings and all that stuff. I really want to go all out,\u201d she says. She\u2019s also hoping her kids will want in on the fun. \u201cI want them to help decorate and do some of those traditions, gingerbread houses and cookies. Maybe I\u2019ll even get them to produce sugar cubes for Santa. Who knows?!\u201d She views these hands-on activities as a way to break her habit of multitasking \u2014 which, she acknowledges, \u201ctakes a lot of value away from the time I spend with my family.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that in this socially distant year, with touch and physical proximity largely off-limits, people are finding creative visual and aural ways to connect with others. Springtime\u2019s nightly clapping and cheering for first responders beget the summer\u2019s illegal fireworks shows, which gave way to giant skeletons come Halloween. Now, at Yuletide, the creative means have become literal, with people taking up those highly Instagrammable crafting projects. In keeping with the nostalgic tone of this Christmas, Elizabeth Schulte of Salem, Oregon, is stepping up her garland-making, using dried fruits like oranges and apples alongside more traditional popcorn and cranberries. The dried apples are the literal fruits of illicit labor; she engaged in a practice called scrumping to obtain them. \u201cIt means, um, liberating apples that are maybe not necessarily legally yours, from a place where there\u2019s no one really necessarily guarding them,\u201d Schulte says. To atone for the scrumping, she\u2019s also considering adopting another historic holiday activity: wassailing. \u201cIt\u2019s where they would go around and sing Christmas songs to the orchard\u201d to encourage the trees to grow more apples, she says. \u201cConsidering how we have just been robbing apples all over the state, maybe we should go and give them some encouragement.\u201d Schulte is incorporating nostalgia in another way. \u201cI\u2019m going to use some strange glitter on one of the garlands, I think maybe on the pine cones.\u201d Strange glitter? Schulte explains that before World War II, glitter was made mostly from ground glass out of Germany, and she wanted the real deal. \u201cIt\u2019s quite annoying to find, I found some online,\u201d she says. The German ground-glass glitter presented another problem, albeit one with a very 2020 solution. \u201cI\u2019m low-key concerned that I\u2019m going to get ground glass into my lungs and eyes,\u201d Schulte says. \u201cI think in order to safely use it, I have to wear a mask.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "Congress seems ready to pass a bipartisan $908 billion stimulus \u2014 if Mitch McConnell says yes A bipartisan group of senators and members of the House unveiled a new $908 billion plan for emergency Covid-19 relief funding on Tuesday. Now, 24 hours later, there has been more movement on stimulus negotiations than in the past three months. In a statement Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the framework \u2014 with extended unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and small business loans \u2014 should be \u201cused as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations\u201d with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell on Tuesday started circulating a counterproposal of his own among Republicans.) \u201cIn the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said. \u201cOf course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.\u201d The movement from Democrats is significant; it comes after months of stalemate on stimulus talks, and during a critical time in the Covid-19 crisis as the US sees another surge in cases heading into the winter. About 14 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits will see those programs expire at the end of the month unless Congress takes action, and cities and states around the country are also facing massive budget shortfalls.  The plan was spearheaded by Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), and other senators, and supported by the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus. It\u2019s designed as a short-term extension of federal aid to see the public through the winter; the funding would extend benefits until April 1, when many public health experts expect distribution of a vaccine to be well underway. \u201cThis is going to get us through the most difficult times,\u201d Manchin said at a Tuesday press conference announcing the framework. McConnell, too, has made moves after meeting with White House officials on Tuesday to suss out what President Donald Trump wants to come out of a coronavirus relief deal. Backed by the White House, McConnell\u2019s version of an emergency package is more limited, providing just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits, rather than the three-month extension in the bipartisan proposal. Pelosi and Schumer backing a cross-party plan isn\u2019t the only significant change from past attempts at a deal. The plan is supported by a number of Republican senators, including Collins, Lisa Murkowski (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), and Bill Cassidy (LA), so it could weaken McConnell\u2019s leverage in upcoming negotiations. On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that he and McConnell agree it would be \u201coptimal\u201d for leadership to wrap up negotiations on a relief package by the weekend, with the end goal being a bill on the floor by next Wednesday or Thursday. \u201c[McConnell] and I both agree that it would be optimal, if in fact we get to an agreement by the end of this weekend, get that agreement put on paper and memorialized so that we can consider it as early as Wednesday or Thursday of next week,\u201d Hoyer said, adding, \u201cI know that sounds very optimistic.\u201d With the November election in the rear-view mirror and coronavirus cases spiking across the country, there seems to be new momentum behind getting a deal done. But there\u2019s still a long way to go, and Trump \u2014 who has proved the wild card for many a congressional deal \u2014 is still very much in the picture. This new proposal is a $908 billion package that repurposes $560 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that passed in March, meaning that this new proposal adds only $348 billion in new spending. It\u2019s much smaller than the $2.2 trillion revised HEROES Act that House Democrats passed in October, but larger than the $500 billion Senate Republicans were proposing in October. Two large sticking points in negotiations have been whether there should be another round of stimulus checks (a priority for Pelosi and Trump) and liability protections for businesses worried about being sued for exposing customers and workers to Covid-19 (a priority of McConnell\u2019s). Republicans came out on top on both of these issues (at least in this initial proposal) \u2014 stimulus checks are not included in this new bipartisan proposal and the framework provided by Sen. Manchin\u2019s office notes that the proposal will \u201cprovide short term Federal protection from Coronavirus related lawsuits with the purpose of giving states time to develop their own response.\u201d Pelosi and Trump have signaled past support for another round of stimulus payments going out to working Americans. But both seem more interested in getting a narrower package approved, in the interest of timing and getting a bill passed quickly. Here\u2019s what made it into the bipartisan proposal:  This program expired in August, so any relief will be welcome for those still unemployed. Congress originally estimated that the UI program would cost $260 billion which the Tax Policy Center viewed as an underestimate, so it\u2019s likely this extension wouldn\u2019t cover the full cost of unemployed workers\u2019 needs. The Washington Post reported that this amount would cover an additional $300 a week for four months. The framework also includes $45 billion for transportation including airlines and Amtrak, $16 billion for vaccine development and more Covid-19 testing and tracing, $82 billion in federal education funding, $10 billion for the struggling US Postal Service, and $10 billion for child care, among other things. \u201cThis is emergency relief, this is designed to get us through this next quarter,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters. \u201cWe know we have more to do, but ... we cannot abandon the American people.\u201d  With McConnell and the White House backing a skinnier Republican proposal, and Pelosi, Schumer, and the bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the $908 billion proposal, the real negotiations will begin. McConnell\u2019s version of an emergency package he sent to his Republican members on Tuesday contains no funding for state and local aid, no money for rental assistance, and provides just a one-month extension of unemployment benefits rather than the bipartisan proposal\u2019s three-month extension. McConnell\u2019s bill contains $332.7 billion for PPP loans, $100 billion for education funding, and $47 billion for vaccine distribution and testing and tracing. In the past, the Senate majority leader has capped his bills at $500 billion. With Democrats coming down from their starting point of $2.2 trillion with the HEROES Act, it\u2019s yet to be seen whether McConnell will also budge from his position. Even though the bipartisan group has more leverage in the Senate, Trump is still president until Biden is sworn in on January 20, and McConnell told reporters he doesn\u2019t want to pass anything that Trump won\u2019t sign. In the coming weeks, Collins, Manchin, and the others will have to reach out to a lot of senators to see if they can increase the support for their plan. But Democrats are also wary of what Trump \u2014 still stinging over his election loss and refusing to concede to Biden \u2014 will do with a stimulus package should it reach his desk.  In short, congressional and White House leaders may be talking, but there\u2019s a long way to go in a short amount of time before a final deal can be reached.",

    "article_text": "Your state\u2019s Covid-19 epidemic, explained in 4 maps America\u2019s national Covid-19 epidemic continues, with the US\u2019s daily new cases still higher than most developed nations and the country recently surpassing 271,000 deaths due to the disease. At the state level, things can look even worse than the national picture. Public health experts look at a few markers to determine how bad things are in each state: the number of daily new cases; the infection rate, which can show how likely the virus is to spread; and the percentage of tests that come back positive, which should be low in a state with sufficient testing. A Vox analysis, updated weekly, indicates the vast majority of states report alarming trends across all three benchmarks for coronavirus outbreaks. Most states still report a high \u2014 sometimes very high \u2014 number of daily new Covid-19 cases. Most still have high infection rates. And most have test positive rates that are too high, indicating they don\u2019t have enough tests to track and contain the scope of their outbreaks. Across these benchmarks, zero states fare well on all three metrics, suggesting no state has its outbreak under control right now. In fact, no state meets even two of three benchmarks \u2014 only Washington, DC, does. (Washington state is excluded due to recent problems with its testing reports.) One caveat: Because of Thanksgiving, states are likely underreporting Covid-19 tests and cases. So as bad as things may already seem, they\u2019re likely even worse than reported. America\u2019s outbreaks, reaching from California to Florida, are the result of the public and the country\u2019s leaders never taking the virus seriously enough and, to the extent they did, letting their guard down prematurely. States, with the support of President Donald Trump, moved to reopen \u2014 often before they saw sizable drops in daily new Covid-19 cases, and at times so quickly they didn\u2019t have time to see if each phase of their reopening was leading to too many more cases.  The public embraced the reopenings, going out and often not adhering to recommended precautions like physical distancing and wearing a mask. Even as cases began to fall later in the summer, America\u2019s overall caseload remained very high. And yet many states moved to reopen once again, with much of the public embracing the looser restrictions and subsequently going out. It\u2019s this mix of government withdrawal and public complacency that experts have cited in explaining why states continue to struggle with getting the coronavirus under control. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that didn\u2019t have to be,\u201d Jaime Slaughter-Acey, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, told me. \u201cFor almost three months, you had opportunities to be proactive with respect to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmissions as well as the development of Covid-19 complications. \u2026 It was not prioritized over the economy.\u201d The effects are felt not just in terms of more infections, critical illnesses, new chronic conditions, and deaths, but in the long-term financial impact as the economy struggles, many people still refuse to go out, and businesses resist reopening during a pandemic. \u201cDead people don\u2019t shop. They don\u2019t spend money. They don\u2019t invest in things,\u201d Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious diseases expert and doctor at the University of Chicago, told me. \u201cWhen you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.\u201d The benchmarks tracked here by Vox don\u2019t cover every important facet of the pandemic. Hospital capacity was previously included among Vox\u2019s metrics, but it\u2019s been removed due to inconsistent data reporting. The data for contact tracing, when \u201cdisease detectives\u201d track down people who may have been infected and push them to quarantine, is also poor. Some measures that are helpful for gauging if a state can safely start to reopen, like the total test count and whether cases have fallen in the previous two weeks, are excluded to focus more on the status of each state\u2019s current Covid-19 outbreak. But together, these three benchmarks help give an idea of how each state is doing in its fight against Covid-19. Nationwide, it\u2019s pretty grim. What\u2019s the goal? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the New York Times and the Census Bureau. Which states meet the goal? None. Why is this important? The most straightforward way to measure whether any place is experiencing a big coronavirus outbreak is to look at the number of daily new Covid-19 cases. There\u2019s no widely accepted metric for how many cases, exactly, is too many. But experts told me that aiming for below four daily new cases per 100,000 is generally a good idea \u2014 a level low enough that a state can say it\u2019s starting to get significant control over the virus. A big caveat to this metric: It\u2019s only as good as a state\u2019s testing. Cases can only get picked up if states are actually testing people for the virus. So if a state doesn\u2019t have enough tests, it\u2019s probably going to miss a lot of cases, and the reported cases won\u2019t tell the full story. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important not to use this benchmark by itself, but to use it alongside metrics like the test positive rate. Along those lines, the number of daily new cases may give a delayed snapshot of a Covid-19 outbreak. If test results take a week to get reported to the state, then the count for daily new cases will really reflect the state of the outbreak for the previous week. If testing is adequate in a state, though, the toll of daily new cases gives perhaps the best snapshot of how big a state\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak is. What\u2019s the goal? An effective reproduction number, or Rt, below 1, based on data from Rt.live, a site created by two Instagram founders and a data analyst. Which states meet the goal? Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin \u2014 13 states. Washington, DC, did as well. Why is this important? The Rt measures how many people are infected by each person with Covid-19. If the Rt is 1, then an infected person will, on average, spread the coronavirus to one other person. If it\u2019s 2, then an infected person will spread it to two on average. And so on. It\u2019s an attempt, then, to gauge how quickly a virus is spreading. One way to think about it: Unlike the count for daily new cases, this gives you a snapshot not of a state\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak today, but of where the outbreak is heading in the near future. The goal is to get the Rt below 1. If each infection doesn\u2019t lead to another, that would over time lead to zero new Covid-19 cases. The estimated Rt can be very imprecise, with margins of error that make it hard to know for certain in any state if it\u2019s really above or below 1. Different modelers can also come up with different estimates. That\u2019s, unfortunately, just the reality of using limited data to come up with a rough estimate of a disease\u2019s overall spread. The Rt also reflects an average. If 10 people are infected with Covid-19, nine spread it to no one else, and one spreads it to 10, that adds up to an Rt of 1. But it masks the fact that individuals, for whatever reason, can still cause superspreading events \u2014 which seem of particular concern with the coronavirus. And the Rt is only as good as the data that goes into calculating it. If a state\u2019s data is poor quality or inconsistent, it might skew the picture. That can help explain why some states with bad and continuing outbreaks may fare better on this benchmark than others. Still, the Rt is one of the better measures we have for tracking a pathogen\u2019s spread across the whole population. When paired with the other metrics on this list, it can give us a sense of each state\u2019s outbreak now and in the future. What\u2019s the goal? Less than 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the past week, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project. Which states meet the goal? Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont \u2014 six states. Washington, DC, did as well. (Washington state is excluded due to recent problems with its testing reports.) Why is this important? To properly track and contain coronavirus outbreaks, states need to have enough testing. There are all sorts of proposals for how much testing is needed in the US, up to the tens of millions. But one way to see if a state is testing enough to match its outbreak is the rate of tests that come back positive. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don\u2019t have the disease or don\u2019t show severe symptoms. High positive rates indicate that only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there\u2019s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak. The goal for the positive rate is, in an ideal world, zero percent, since that would suggest that Covid-19 is vanquished entirely. More realistically, in a world going through a pandemic, the positive rate should be below 5 percent. But even if a state reaches 5 percent, experts argue it should continue trying to push that number further down \u2014 to match nations like Germany, New Zealand, and South Korea that have gotten their positive rates below 3 percent and even 1 percent \u2014 in order to truly get ahold of their outbreaks. As long as a state is above 5 percent, chances are it\u2019s still missing a significant number of Covid-19 cases. And the higher that number is, the more cases that are very likely getting missed.  So even if your state is reporting a low number of daily new cases, a high positive rate should be a cause for alarm \u2014 a sign that there\u2019s an outbreak that\u2019s only hidden due to a lack of testing. And if your state is reporting a high number of daily new cases and a high positive rate, that\u2019s all the more reason for concern, suggesting the epidemic is even worse than the total case count indicates.

    "article_text": "Who will get the Covid-19 vaccine first? A CDC advisory panel just weighed in. With two Covid-19 vaccine candidates expected to be approved for the US market in the coming weeks, a group of experts met Tuesday to advise on which Americans should be immunized first. In a 13-1 vote, they put health care personnel and staff and residents of long-term care facilities at the front of the line.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent medical and public health experts, has been meeting for months to think through the question of whom to prioritize during a pandemic while vaccine supplies are still limited.  ACIP is highly influential in the US. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which overwhelmingly accepts the committee\u2019s guidance. States aren\u2019t obliged to follow it, however. It\u2019s up to governors \u2014 and individual hospitals and vaccine sites \u2014 to make their own vaccine prioritization plans.  But with coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths rising exponentially, the meeting was another stark reminder that vaccine rationing will be a painful reality for months while supplies remain short.  \u201cThere is an average of one Covid death per minute right now,\u201d said Dr. Beth Bell of the University of Washington, who chairs ACIP\u2019s Work Groups, at the meeting\u2019s opening. \u201cIn the time it takes us to have this ACIP meeting, 180 people will have died of Covid-19.\u201d  And that\u2019s one reason why, vaccine and public health experts told Vox, ACIP should have weighed in sooner. Major health groups like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have published advice on how countries and other decision-making bodies can set their prioritization plans for Covid-19 vaccines.  \u201cIt would have been helpful to have this a week ago,\u201d said Ruth Faden, the founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, since states, which have been waiting on the guidance, must place their first orders of Covid-19 vaccines with the government and share their initial distribution plans by Friday. \u201cStates were not caught completely unaware here,\u201d Faden added \u2014 since ACIP had signaled in previous meetings the direction they were likely to go \u2014 but Tuesday\u2019s guidance could have been more specific, particularly when it comes to how to immunize America\u2019s health workforce. ACIP\u2019s primary task on Tuesday was to vote for phase 1a of the rollout for two priority groups: health care personnel and long-term care facility staff and residents, comprising about 24 million people.  According to CDC officials, there will only be 5 million to 10 million doses of the vaccines available per week for these groups once vaccines are approved, which should happen before the end of the year. The two manufacturers that are expected to have vaccines approved first, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, will have enough doses to vaccinate only around 20 million people by the end of December.  Long-term care facility residents and staff are a top priority because they have accounted for 40 percent of US Covid-19 deaths, according to the committee. And it makes sense to prioritize health care workers \u2014 they\u2019ve also been among the groups hardest hit by the virus, and we need them healthy and working to keep the health system functioning.  But the gap between the priority groups and the expected supply is a problem ACIP should have addressed, experts say.  It\u2019s not clear from the guidance who among the health workers should go first, said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of public health at Yale School of Public Health. \u201cThis matters because states might have 20,000 or 100,000 doses and figuring out where to use them in a priority group is going to be a hard question.\u201d  ACIP has only said that \u201cindividuals with direct patient contact,\u201d personnel working in residential care and long-term care facilities, and workers without coronavirus infection in the last 90 days should go first.  \u201cDirect patient care is often interpreted as physicians and nurses and clinicians,\u201d said Saad Omer, director at the Yale Institute for Global Health, who is part of both the WHO and NASEM Covid-19 vaccine prioritization committees. \u201cBut you have to go beyond that to explicitly say that includes cleaning workers, others who are doing housekeeping, etc.\u201d  These groups are potentially just as exposed to the coronavirus as ICU doctors or nurses since they\u2019re working in the same high-risk spaces.  \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between say a dermatologist that\u2019s doing cosmetic surgery in a private office and somebody who\u2019s in a Covid-19 ward in a large inner-city hospital,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, added. \u201cIt would be enormously helpful if there could be a greater stratification based upon risk of the health worker.\u201d  What\u2019s more, had ACIP been more specific about which health workers are high risk, \u201cyou leave open a strategy of prioritizing them then going to other high-risk groups rather than [immunizing] the entirety of the health system workforce,\u201d said Faden \u2014 who also advises the WHO on vaccine prioritization. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said most states are planning to be able to immunize their entire health care workforce within three weeks of getting the first Covid-19 vaccine shipments. If that\u2019s true, \u201cissues here regarding sub-prioritization will be very short-lived and the need for more detailed guidance is reduced,\u201d Schwartz said.  ACIP typically sets recommendations for vaccine policy based on specific vaccines, and they\u2019ll reconvene and potentially shift their advice as soon as Covid-19 vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They\u2019ll also need to vote on which groups come after phase 1a of the rollout.  If ACIP follows through with what they\u2019ve been telegraphing so far, the committee will prioritize essential workers (such as teachers, food and agriculture workers, police, and firefighters) in phase 1b, and adults 65 and older and with high-risk medical conditions in phase 1c.  ACIP would deviate from other international expert groups with this plan, Omer said. The WHO and NASEM vaccine frameworks have both prioritized older adults and adults with underlying health conditions alongside or immediately after health workers, instead of essential workers.  \u201cThe reason everyone is prioritizing the elderly \u2014 compared to people 18 to 29 years of age  \u2014 is that even at ages 65 to 74, they have a 90 times higher risk of death,\u201d Omer explained. \u201cMy hope is [ACIP] will revisit some of the assumptions that were driving the considerations for the trade-off between essential workers and older age populations.\u201d  ",

    "article_text": "The government\u2019s failure to provide economic relief is killing people When Covid-19 began spreading across the United States this spring, the federal government put in place a series of protections to help workers and families weather the economic impact. Then, one by one, the government took them all away. Expanded unemployment insurance, which helped keep millions of laid-off workers out of poverty, expired at the end of July. Federal stimulus checks were issued to millions of taxpayers once, beginning in April, but never again. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans meant to keep small businesses afloat expired in August, even as many of those businesses faced a second surge in cases. And it\u2019s about to get a lot worse, with a host of benefits from student loan forbearance to the federal eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of December. Many economists agree that the federal government\u2019s insufficient economic protections are  driving Americans \u2014 especially low-wage workers who have been hard-hit in the pandemic \u2014 further into poverty. But something else is also becoming clear: The lack of economic safeguards for Americans is making Covid-19 worse, too. The latest evidence is a study showing that lifting state-level eviction moratoriums, which allowed landlords to once again kick out renters for nonpayment, was associated with an increase in Covid-19 infections. Between March and September, getting rid of the bans and allowing evictions to continue led to as many as 433,700 excess Covid-19 cases and 10,700 deaths, the researchers found. Meanwhile, the lack of relief for small-business owners is forcing many to choose between closing their doors forever or staying open during the pandemic \u2014 and contributing to transmission rates. \u201cThey\u2019re making heartbreaking decisions every day,\u201d Lindsey Leininger, a public health educator and professor at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, told Vox. And with unemployment benefits running out, workers are forced to go back to unsafe occupations, even if they have underlying conditions that make them especially vulnerable to the virus. \u201cWe have not made it feasible for most people to safely shelter in place,\u201d Camara Phyllis Jones, a family physician, epidemiologist, and past president of the American Public Health Association, told Vox. Those most affected by the lack of economic protection are those most impacted by Covid-19: Black Americans, other people of color, and people living in poverty. And as the country enters a dark winter, inaction by the Trump administration and Congress isn\u2019t just hurting Americans\u2019 livelihoods \u2014 it\u2019s costing them their lives. Covid-19 caused unprecedented economic devastation when it began spreading in the US earlier this year. As restaurants, hotels, and other businesses shuttered, unemployment reached heights unseen since the Great Depression. In late March, more than 6 million people filed for unemployment in a single week; before the pandemic, the highest number of initial claims in a week was about 700,000 in 1982. Food banks were overwhelmed with individuals and families unable to afford groceries, and the nonprofit Feeding America projected that one in six Americans \u2014 including one in four children \u2014 could experience food insecurity in 2020. Meanwhile, 5.6 million workers lost their employer-provided health insurance in March and April, leaving many without a way to pay for medical care during a public health crisis. To help blunt the pandemic\u2019s economic impact, Congress instituted a number of measures: a $600-per-week addition to unemployment benefits, an expansion of unemployment insurance to cover part-time and gig economy workers, a stimulus check of up to $1,200 paid to many Americans, and PPP loans to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll. Some state and local governments also announced eviction moratoriums, and in September, the federal government ordered its own ban through the end of the year. The programs were far from perfect, but they helped many Americans stay afloat: Despite skyrocketing unemployment, some estimates found that poverty actually fell in April and May thanks to the availability of federal aid. But as the virus continued to surge, that aid started to dry up. It\u2019s now been four months since expanded unemployment benefits expired, and Congress hasn\u2019t approved any new relief in that time. That\u2019s hurting Americans\u2019 ability to pay their bills and provide for their families \u2014 especially if they previously worked in low-wage service sector jobs that were disproportionately hard-hit in the spring and have been slow to return. But it\u2019s also hurting the country\u2019s ability to fight the virus. Small businesses are one example. While experts don\u2019t yet have a complete picture of what\u2019s driving Covid-19 transmission right now, they generally agree that some of the most dangerous venues for spread are places like restaurants, bars, and gyms \u2014 venues \u201cwhere almost by definition, people can\u2019t wear masks and are indoors,\u201d as Brandon Guthrie, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the University of Washington, told Vox. For example, one study found that people who tested positive for Covid-19 were about twice as likely to have recently eaten in a restaurant compared to those who tested negative. However, many states and cities have been slow to shut down such businesses, even in the face of a devastating third wave this fall. In New York, for example, restaurants remain open for indoor dining while schools are closed, though Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan to bring elementary school students back later in December. In much of Florida, restaurants and bars opened at full capacity in September, despite continued spread of the virus. Many factors (including pressure from the Trump administration to just open everything) have gone into state and local leaders\u2019 decisions about business restrictions. But since the summer, one big factor has been the lack of federal aid to small businesses and workers. Policymakers know that if they institute shutdowns, restaurants and bars will go out of business and workers will lose jobs. This likely factors into their decision-making. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard governors saying that the availability of those federal funds has been important,\u201d Guthrie said, and they \u201care really concerned about what is going to happen if those resources dry up.\u201d In the absence of those resources, meanwhile, individual businesses can\u2019t easily decide to stay closed \u2014 even if their owners know it might be dangerous to remain open. Restaurants and bars \u201care not high-margin businesses even in the best of times,\u201d Leininger said. Their proprietors often \u201cwant to do right by public health, but also want to do right by their families and their workers in terms of livelihoods.\u201d It\u2019s hard to quantify exactly how much the lack of federal support for businesses and workers has contributed to Covid-19 spread. But clusters of infections have been linked to reopened bars and restaurants, including a Friendly\u2019s in Riverhead, New York, and a brewpub in East Lansing, Michigan. Between March and August, around one-quarter of Louisiana\u2019s Covid-19 cases outside of nursing homes and prisons \u201cstemmed from bars and restaurants,\u201d the New York Times reported; in Colorado, 9 percent of all outbreaks as of August had been traced to such venues. \u201cEvery time we see an outbreak that\u2019s seeded in a bar or from a restaurant establishment with indoor dining, that is something that could have potentially been prevented if those settings weren\u2019t open,\u201d Leininger said. It\u2019s not just about supporting businesses. Individual Americans haven\u2019t gotten the help they need from their government to keep themselves safe, either. Earlier in the year, expanded unemployment may have helped people reduce their exposure to the virus because they \u201cfelt less pressure to have to go back into higher-risk settings\u201d for work, Guthrie said. But the expiration of those benefits, along with the ongoing damage to the job market caused by the pandemic, has forced many people to take any job they can get \u2014 even if that means exposing themselves and their families to the virus. \u201cIf you are a waitress, and you managed to get some hours at the place where you work but they\u2019re not doing social distancing and they\u2019re not providing PPE [personal protective equipment], are you going to take the chance to quit and try to go work somewhere else?\u201d asked Janelle Jones, managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative. Especially with a lack of help from the federal government, many Americans can\u2019t afford to take that chance. Others, meanwhile, have been unable to find work or pay their bills \u2014 and an increasing number face eviction from their homes. Forty-three states and Washington, DC, passed eviction bans earlier this year, but some lasted as little as 10 weeks and many expired in the summer. As of July, large shares of renters in many states \u2014 58 percent in Tennessee and 59 percent in West Virginia, for example \u2014 were at risk of being evicted, according to CNBC. The authors of a new study found that lifting state-level eviction moratoriums, in addition to costing people their homes, also contributed to the spread of Covid-19. \u201cWhen people are evicted, they often move in with friends and family, and that increases your number of contacts,\u201d UCLA\u2019s Kathryn Leifheit, one of the study\u2019s co-authors, explained to CNBC. Others may move into a shelter, also increasing their risk. Whether it\u2019s unemployment or evictions, Black and Latinx Americans, who are less likely than white people to have the accumulated wealth to weather an economic crisis, have been disproportionately affected, likely contributing to the high rates of infection and death in many communities of color. \u201cPeople of color are more likely to be infected because we\u2019re more exposed and less protected,\u201d Camara Phyllis Jones, the epidemiologist, said. The lack of economic protections is as important to understand as the lack of PPE and other safety measures. \u201cWhen you force people to enter into situations that are more dangerous because of an economic need when you could address the economic need,\u201d Jones said, it means \u201cwe have prioritized some people\u2019s profit over other people\u2019s lives.\u201d The situation is about to become even more dire, since a number of programs, including the nationwide moratorium on evictions and the extension of unemployment to part-time and gig economy workers, are slated to expire at the end of the year. \u201cWe\u2019re already in a situation that is like a terror state of economic disasters,\u201d the Groundwork Collaborative\u2019s Jones told Vox, \u201cand it will just get worse at the end of the year.\u201d Experts are clear that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Additional federal support for bars and restaurants would allow these businesses to shut down until it\u2019s safe to reopen. \u201cThis is restaurant owners\u2019 and bar owners\u2019 time of need,\u201d Leininger said. Meanwhile, a continuation of unemployment benefits, along with paid leave and affordable health care, could help ordinary people stay safe at home and help the US control the virus, Jones said. More direct payments like the spring stimulus checks may also be necessary: \u201cWe can send people money,\u201d Janelle Jones added. \u201cWe know how to do it.\u201d After months of deadlock in which Republicans opposed more generous proposals by Democrats, Congress may be starting to move on the issue: On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators announced a $908 billion stimulus plan that would include $300 per week in additional unemployment benefits for individuals, as well as support for state and local governments and small businesses, the Washington Post reported. But even this compromise, which leaves out additional stimulus payments to individuals and is significantly slimmer than the $2 trillion package sought by Democrats, will have a difficult road in a Republican-controlled Senate. And while Congress fights it out, millions of Americans will have to continue living and working through a pandemic without the economic cushion needed to keep themselves and others safe. \u201cIt is a choice we\u2019re making every day to leave millions of people this insecure and vulnerable,\u201d Jones said.",

    "article_text": "Is the pandemic making people more generous \u2014 or more selfish? Today is Giving Tuesday, a day that encourages everyone to refocus on doing good after the annual post-Thanksgiving shopping blitz. People have donated millions to charity through Giving Tuesday fundraisers every year since the movement kicked off in 2012. But what does generosity look like in 2020? Has the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 and its attendant recession \u2014 made us more or less generous this year? Has it changed the way we give? We won\u2019t fully know until 2020 is behind us because around 30 percent of total annual giving happens in December, with many people making their tax-deductible donations on the very last days of the year. But we\u2019ve already got some telling data about how much people are giving. \u201cAs far as we can tell, the overall trend line is up,\u201d Victoria Vrana, a deputy director at the Gates Foundation, told me. She cited a study from the Fundraising Effectiveness Project, which collects real-time data from several online fundraising platforms. \u201cThey\u2019re showing an overall increase in the whole first half of the year. And the exciting part is really the increase in small gifts and new donors.\u201d While you\u2019d expect high-net-worth donors to give more during a crisis, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect similar behavior from average people hurting from an economic downturn. Yet 56 percent of US households gave to charity or volunteered in response to the pandemic, and the first half of 2020 saw a 12.6 percent increase in the number of new donors to charity compared to one year ago.  The causes that are faring especially well are the ones with an obvious connection to the pandemic, like hunger relief and health care. According to a Harris Poll survey conducted for Fast Company, \u201chunger relief has seen the most charitable giving \u2014 34 percent, among those who have given to charity during the pandemic \u2014 followed by religious organizations (31 percent) and health and medical organizations (29 percent).\u201d That tracks with what Charity Navigator saw from March to October: Donations to Feeding America increased 1,980 percent year over year, and donations to Doctors Without Borders increased 131 percent year over year.  It\u2019s obviously great that donors are trying to make sure people get food and health care during a pandemic. But while nonprofits focused on Covid-19 relief are getting substantial funding in every US state \u2014 including rapid-response grants from community foundations that have raised more than $1 billion for the purpose \u2014 nonprofits doing crucial non-pandemic-related work are getting left out. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some cause areas get a tremendous influx, and others that are just drying up,\u201d Vrana told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported in August that even as Covid-19 donations were soaring, other charities were taking a big hit; with galas, auctions, and fundraisers canceled, nonprofits were really struggling to raise the funds they rely on. A sobering reflection of this is that some 1 million nonprofit workers in the US have lost their jobs because of the pandemic. On the plus side, the global nature of the pandemic has prompted some donors to think beyond their own backyards and to embrace direct cash transfers as a way of offering relief to people across the world. \u201cA super-interesting, huge new trend we\u2019ve been seeing is this interest in directly giving to individuals,\u201d Vrana said, noting that the Gates Foundation\u2019s recently created site PowerOf.org, which aggregates vetted donation opportunities for helping people through the pandemic, includes more than 40 funds that direct cash to individuals in need. She added that trusted nonprofits like GiveDirectly, a charity with over a decade of experience distributing cash transfers, have come out in a huge way during the pandemic. GiveDirectly set up two emergency responses: one in the US, for which it has raised $118 million, and one in African countries, for which it has raised $76 million. The charity has sent cash relief to 116,000 families in the US and 342,000 families across Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, and Rwanda.  \u201cThere\u2019s something unique about how central cash has been to people\u2019s response to this crisis. It feels different from prior crises,\u201d Joe Huston, managing director at GiveDirectly, told me. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a ton of cash relief funds spin up, including people giving out cash themselves on Twitter. I haven\u2019t seen a period like this where so many people from so many different types of philanthropy have started with cash transfers as a primary tool in their toolbox.\u201d This year has also seen increased support for cash transfers in the form of a universal basic income (UBI). With the pandemic generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, and with federal stimulus packages failing to meet the needs of millions, advocates argued that citizens desperately need some sort of guaranteed income. Spain\u2019s government seemed to listen, offering payments of up to 1,015 euros ($1,145) to the poorest families in the country, and Germany started a new basic income experiment in August. On both sides of the Atlantic, public support for UBI is higher than usual. When cognitive scientists Daniel Nettle and Rebecca Saxe surveyed people in the US and UK in April, May, and September, they found that the pandemic boosted support for UBI in both places. However, they also found some preliminary indications that people believe others will act more selfishly than cooperatively in a pandemic. As the Stanford psychologist Jamil Zaki has documented, there are two basic stories people like to tell about how human beings behave in times of crisis. According to one story, individuals panic, flout social norms, and behave selfishly. The crisis unleashes an amoral free-for-all as each person gives in to a scarcity mentality and decides to look out for their own interests \u2014 to hell with everyone else.  The other story holds just the opposite: People are wonderfully generous in the wake of disaster! They donate money, they volunteer, they try to help their neighbors. We see more altruism and prosocial behavior during a crisis than we do in normal times.  The first narrative is often seen reflected in media coverage. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, the New York Times described New Orleans as a \u201csnake pit of anarchy, death, looting, raping, marauding thugs.\u201d And partly because of media portrayals, this lawless behavior is what many people have come to expect in times of crisis. In one study, people generally agreed with statements like \u201cWhen there is an emergency, crowd members act selfishly\u201d and \u201cWhen there is an emergency, social order breaks down.\u201d But when you look at the historical record, it actually offers a lot of support for the second narrative. \u201cCatastrophe compassion,\u201d Zaki writes, \u201cis widespread and consistent; it follows earthquakes, war, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, and tsunamis, and \u2014 now \u2014 a pandemic.\u201d For example, as Covid-19 spread, volunteers around the world began creating mutual aid Google docs. In these shared spreadsheets, they jotted down their contact information and offers to bring groceries or medications to vulnerable neighbors. (Likewise, in the wake of Katrina, most people in New Orleans were peaceful and helpful to each other.) Yet people in general still tend to believe the more pessimistic story about human nature. Athena Aktipis, a psychologist at Arizona State University, told me that\u2019s partly because people have internalized work from the annals of psychology, behavioral economics, and evolutionary biology (think The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins) to mean that we generally look out for No. 1 when faced with adversity.  But recent work in psychology, including Aktipis\u2019s own research with the Human Generosity Project, complicates that picture. It\u2019s convinced her that times of crisis can bring out the best in us, so long as we\u2019re not worried that others will take advantage of our willingness to cooperate. In early March, she and her colleagues started asking people around the world questions meant to gauge their feelings of cooperativeness. As the pandemic spread, they found that people increasingly agreed with statements like \u201cMy neighborhood and I rise and fall together\u201d and \u201cAll of humanity and I rise and fall together.\u201d In other words, people\u2019s perceived interdependence with others generally increased. In fact, people\u2019s ratings of interdependence with all of humanity were actually higher than with their own neighborhoods. And the survey respondents\u2019 willingness to help citizens of other countries increased. So the surge in pandemic-related generosity hasn\u2019t come as a surprise to Aktipis. As she told me, \u201cWhen people are most in need, that\u2019s when most of the giving happens.\u201d  Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we\u2019ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 and how to get better at doing good.",

    "article_text": "\u201cThe stakes are life and death\u201d: Addiction treatment\u2019s Covid-19 challenge When the Covid-19 pandemic forced much of the US to lock down in the spring of 2020, officials and experts worried the necessary social distancing measures would make another public health crisis \u2014 the opioid epidemic \u2014 worse. Addiction treatment is traditionally done in person, and restrictions on gatherings and closed businesses would make it much less accessible. So the federal government responded by easing rules for getting into treatment virtually \u2014 making it easier for treatment providers to retain patients and attract new ones. Even before the pandemic, experts had been calling for making treatment easier to get in the US, and the new rules were a big step forward. But with vaccines for the coronavirus moving through clinical trials and the end of the pandemic in sight, advocates are worried that the old rules will snap back into place \u2014 making it harder, once again, to get people into addiction treatment. Officials relaxed federal rules in several ways. They allowed doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, an evidence-based medication for opioid addiction, over video or audio calls without requiring an in-person evaluation. They also made it easier to prescribe the medication across state lines, which previously required prescribers to be licensed in both states. And they eased rules for take-home doses of methadone, another proven opioid addiction medication, which traditionally is administered daily to patients at an in-person clinic. State and federal officials also made it possible for public health insurance programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, to pay for telemedicine addiction treatment services. And some places received permission to go further \u2014 for example, delivering methadone to patients rather than requiring they pick it up in person. Providers say the changes really helped. Many of them had to go virtual almost overnight, as the threat of the coronavirus became clear to much of the country. But they had feared they wouldn\u2019t be able to prescribe necessary medications at all, given the arduous rules on such drugs, possibly putting their patients at risk of relapse, overdose, and death.  Things haven\u2019t gone perfectly, but the relaxed rules, providers and experts say, have helped avoid the worst of it. \u201cIt was incredibly challenging [for us], as it was for all providers,\u201d Alexis Geier-Horan, vice president of government relations at the addiction treatment provider CleanSlate, told me. \u201cThankfully, we really didn\u2019t lose many patients. \u2026 That was only possible because of what the federal government did in response to public health emergencies.\u201d Addiction treatment has long been difficult to access in the US. According to federal data, only 1 in 10 people with a drug use disorder get specialty treatment. Multiple problems play into that treatment gap, including a lack of local providers, high costs, and poor insurance coverage. Much of the treatment provided lacks evidence, or even rejects evidence-based modalities, and can even be downright fraudulent \u2014 leaving potential patients resistant to getting care in a broken system. That\u2019s why, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, activists and providers were calling for making it easier to prescribe addiction medications. Pandemic or not, some patients have always struggled with transportation, or lived in underserved areas that would require a lengthy trip to get treatment. For these patients, getting prescriptions by telemedicine or phone, or simply having to go to a clinic less often for medication, would help. On the flip side, the patients who now rely on these services to get treatment, regardless of the pandemic, could stand to lose if the relaxed regulations expire. That\u2019s what those in the field are now worried about: If those patients lose their means to treatment, they might give up on it altogether. That would come at a particularly calamitous time for the opioid epidemic. Even before the pandemic, drug overdose deaths were trending up. But with the pandemic and continuing spread of the potent opioid fentanyl, overdose deaths have skyrocketed this year: On April 2020 (the latest month of data), there were nearly 78,000 drug overdose deaths, based on preliminary federal data \u2014 a 13 percent increase from the same time last year, setting up 2020 to be the worst year for overdose deaths ever. That\u2019s not, advocates and experts say, a sign that the measures easing access to addiction treatment failed, but rather that the measures didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t go far enough to address a rapidly worsening overdose crisis. While the measures likely helped ease some of the pain brought on by Covid-19, they couldn\u2019t resolve all the hurdles to treatment in America. That\u2019s a case for building on the relaxed rules, not taking them away when the pandemic subsides. \u201cThe stakes are life and death,\u201d Kelly Clark, president of the advocacy group Addiction Crisis Solutions, told me. \u201cWe know, absolutely, that people who are taking their maintenance medications like buprenorphine for opioid addiction have a decreased chance of dying prematurely because of their addiction compared to those who aren\u2019t on medications. This is very clear.\u201d Two of the three federally approved medications for opioid addiction, methadone and buprenorphine, are among the most regulated drugs in the country. Methadone is only administered at specialized clinics \u2014 requiring patients to go to a clinic as often as daily to get it, and only letting them earn the ability to take some doses home over time. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by a doctor and picked up at a pharmacy, like other medications, but it still requires the prescriber to go through a special certification, and starting a patient required an in-person medical evaluation. Then the Covid-19 pandemic came, almost immediately making these requirements unfeasible for patients and providers who now had to get and do treatment virtually. So federal agencies took advantage of the federal public health emergency declared to combat Covid-19 to ease the rules \u2014 making telemedicine, including video and audio calls, more feasible for buprenorphine, and easing rules for methadone take-home doses. Local and state agencies followed suit. But the changes are only in effect until the public health emergency expires. That\u2019s left advocates and providers worried, and they\u2019re increasingly sounding the alarm \u2014 as early as possible \u2014 to get Congress or other officials to act. They\u2019ve called on federal lawmakers to pass the TREATS Act, which would make many of the rule changes permanent, as soon as possible. \u201cSpeaking for [the American Society of Addiction Medicine], ASAM would love to see the TREATS Act passed with any kind of legislation that goes through during this lame-duck [period], so that we don\u2019t have to face this other unknown coming into the year,\u201d Clark, former president of ASAM and vice chair of the group\u2019s Covid-19 task force, told me. The typical argument for keeping the old rules comes down to fears of diversion: that the medications will be diverted to a black market for recreational uses. Buprenorphine and methadone are opioids, and, though they\u2019re very effective for treating addiction, they can be misused. So loosening access to either too much, the argument goes, could lead to the drugs ending up in the wrong hands. As the Drug Enforcement Administration put it, \u201cUnder normal circumstances, DEA would not consider the initiation of treatment with a controlled substance based on a mere phone call to be consistent with the framework of the [Controlled Substance Act] given that doing so creates a high risk of diversion.\u201d Providers take these concerns very seriously, and have adopted a range of practices, such as regular urine screenings, to make sure people are actually taking their medications and not relapsing. Many providers are concerned that loosening the rules too much, and simply doing treatment virtually, could make it harder to prevent diversion. At the same time, some experts argue that concerns about diversion are overblown. For one, some research suggests that diversion is a result of people not being able to legally obtain buprenorphine or other treatment, forcing them to resort to illegal means of getting the medication. So the stricter regulations could be causing more diversion, not preventing it. That indicates a balancing act is needed. If it turns out, in the pandemic, that expanding telemedicine for buprenorphine increases access without much more, if any, diversion, then maybe the right balance is more toward a laxer regime than the longstanding laws and rules suggest. \u201cThese agencies are trying to balance the public safety side of making these changes with the public health side,\u201d Geier-Horan, who previously worked on addiction treatment under the Obama administration, said. \u201cFrom a CleanSlate perspective, the benefit of these things far outweighs those [diversion] concerns.\u201d Some researchers are working to find out if that\u2019s the case, studying how virtual treatment has worked throughout the pandemic. A JAMA Psychiatry article noted there\u2019s a dearth of research on the role of telemedicine in addiction treatment, including whether it improves access and can be done without significantly increasing diversion.  \u201cThat could be really helpful in getting people on board,\u201d Allison Lin, lead author of the JAMA Psychiatry article and an addiction psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Michigan and the VA Center for Clinical Management Research, told me. \u201cWe do need more research to provide that data. We don\u2019t have those kinds of answers just yet.\u201d Short of that, providers are sharing their own experiences, arguing that they\u2019ve been able to maintain a level of care, and even gain some patients, throughout the pandemic despite the obvious disruptions Covid-19 has brought on. But they also worry that losing the new tools they have now could lead to the opposite result once the pandemic is over, fueling a drug overdose crisis that\u2019s already getting worse. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has in some ways overshadowed it, America\u2019s opioid epidemic is still in full force. It\u2019s in fact gotten worse this year, based on the data we have. The widespread sense of isolation and despair that many people have felt this year, coupled with greater difficulty finding help for such problems as many places close down, has contributed to more drug overdose deaths. Paired with that, the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl has continued to supplant heroin in more of the illicit market \u2014 and in part because it\u2019s so potent, it\u2019s more likely to cause overdoses and deaths. \u201cWhile our attention has gone to Covid, and rightly so, our overdose deaths have skyrocketed,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe have to keep overdose deaths on the map.\u201d One of the key contributors to this crisis all along has been lack of access to evidence-based treatment. Good treatment remains very difficult to get in the US \u2014 it can cost tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket, and despite those high costs, it\u2019s still frequently of bad to mediocre quality. One family I spoke to last year told me that they spent $200,000 on treatment before they found something that worked. That\u2019s an extreme example, but it\u2019s not rare, based on the thousands of responses to Vox\u2019s survey about the issue, for people to spend an exorbitant amount on treatment and end up with little to nothing to show for it. That\u2019s not because evidence-based treatment doesn\u2019t exist. For opioid addiction, the medications are truly proven to work well. Studies show buprenorphine and methadone reduce all-cause mortality among opioid addiction patients by half or more, and they do a far better job of keeping people in treatment than non-medication approaches. There are all sorts of other good treatment modalities for other kinds of addiction, including medications and paying people to stay in treatment (known as contingency management). But these evidence-based approaches are dramatically underutilized. According to federal data, only 42 percent of the nearly 15,000 facilities tracked by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provide any type of medication for opioid addiction. This is largely driven by stigma \u2014 the faulty notion that medications replace one drug for another, even though the medications are proven to improve outcomes compared to continuing to use illicit drugs. So there\u2019s a dearth of providers for evidence-based treatment. When those providers are available, they might not be covered by insurance, and cost thousands out of pocket. If someone has gone to a treatment facility before and ended up with a bad experience due to shoddy, evidence-less care, they also might be skeptical that there\u2019s good help out there at all. That all makes treatment less accessible, and people less receptive to it. That\u2019s why much of the work to combat the opioid epidemic, from legislation passed by Congress to state efforts to more localized approaches to lawsuits, has gone to expanding access to treatment: If truly effective treatment exists, then it\u2019s just a matter of making sure it\u2019s available to the public. Along those lines, activists had pushed for more access to telemedicine for years. Of particular concern were underserved areas with few providers \u2014 like rural West Virginia, which has a massive overdose crisis and not enough addiction treatment providers to handle demand from patients. Telemedicine can make it easier for existing providers to serve other areas in the state, or even people in other states entirely. It\u2019s also about expanding the spectrum of care. Every person dealing with addiction is different. Some people are fine with being on medications; some people aren\u2019t. Some will like treatment through Zoom or phone; some won\u2019t. Some have a car; some have no reliable transportation. By offering a variety of options for what care is delivered and how, the hope is fewer people won\u2019t get into treatment because there\u2019s not an option for them. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say everybody should get telehealth, or everybody should get in-person [treatment],\u201d Lin said. \u201cIt was just that, before, everybody was in person because that was the only option available.\u201d Covid-19 has made a lot of things worse, including the opioid crisis. A silver lining to all of this is it\u2019s also given us a big, ongoing experiment to see if a telemedicine model can work for addiction care. Some providers are now hoping that the eventual end of the pandemic isn\u2019t the end of that experiment \u2014 given that it may be helping stave off what\u2019s already the worst drug overdose crisis in American history.",

The Arizona legislature closed for the coming week after Giuliani and Ellis held an 11-hour hearing with a panel of Republican state lawmakers last week, the Arizona Capitol Times reported. Lawmakers will be forced to cancel some partially remote interim committee meetings, according to the Arizona Capitol Times. GIULIANI: PUSH FOR LEGISLATURES TO PICK ELECTORS IS 'FURTHEST ALONG' IN GEORGIA Ellis' criticism of House Speaker Rusty Bowers comes as President Donald\u00a0Trump's allies in the state are pushing for the Arizona legislature to overhaul how the state's electors are chosen and recall Arizona's certification of the election. \"Absolutely unnecessary. Call [Speaker] Rusty Bowers in AZ and tell him not to use COVID as an EXCUSE!!\" Ellis wrote on Twitter. The Trump legal team's efforts to urge state lawmakers to override the results of the\u00a0election\u00a0and appoint their own electors is \"furthest along\" in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0with other efforts in Arizona and Michigan, Giuliani told \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d RUDY GIULIANI TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS It's unclear how or when Giuliani contracted the virus. \"Mayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement.\u00a0\"The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return.\" Before Giuliani's coronavirus diagnosis, Bowers signaled an opposition to convening the state legislature to change Arizona elector law, saying in a statement that the Trump legal team offered \"only theories, not proof\" of widespread election fraud. \"Even if such evidence existed, the Arizona Legislature simply couldn\u2019t do what is being asked. Under our state\u2019s constitution, the Legislature can act only when it is in session, and the Legislature could call itself into a special session only with the support of a bipartisan supermajority of its members. That won\u2019t materialize,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"For decades, Arizona law has required that the voters elect the state\u2019s electors on Election Day\u2014this year, on November 3rd,\" Bowers continued. \"And under a law the Republican-led Legislature passed just three years ago, the state\u2019s electors are required to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide election canvass.\"",

KAREN BASS WANTS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO REPLACE KAMALA HARRIS IN THE SENATE Republicans are already signaling their opposition to Becerra. \"Xavier Becerra spent his career attacking pro-life Americans and tried to force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise abortions,\" Sen.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom will appoint a senator to fill out the remainder of her term, and Becerra was rumored to be a leading contender. Biden also named Dr. Anthony Fauci as his chief medical adviser on COVID-19. Fauci is currently director of the\u00a0National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Biden said Fauci would continue to hold that position as well.

    "article_text": "Staten Island bar owner accused of hitting deputy with car was \u2018scared for his life,\u2019 lawyer says The co-owner of a Staten Island bar who officials say has continued to defy New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s coronavirus restrictions was arrested early Sunday for the second time in less than a week after allegedly hitting a deputy with his car, authorities said. Danny Presti\u00a0was trying to leave\u00a0his bar, Mac's Public House, after deputies observed patrons entering the establishment Saturday night in violation of city and state closure orders, New York City Sheriff Joseph Fucito said.\u00a0 STATEN ISLAND BAR CO-OWNER SPEAKS OUT AFTER ARREST FOR DEFYING NEW YORK COVID-19 ORDERS When deputies tried to arrest the 34-year-old bar owner, he got into his car and drove off, striking a deputy, Fucito said. Presti continued driving for about 100 yards with the deputy hanging onto the hood before he was stopped and apprehended, the sheriff said. Charges against Presti were pending. The injured deputy was taken to a hospital for treatment, though his condition wasn't immediately available. Presti\u2019s attorney, Lou Gelormino, told Fox News on Sunday that his client was approached on the street \"well past midnight, by two Sheriff personnel dressed in their dark uniforms.\"\u00a0 \"Without identifying themselves as Officers they proceeded to yell, 'Presti,' and run towards him,\" Gelormino said in a statement.\u00a0 Gelormino said Presti -- who has received \"numerous death threats\" -- \"became scared for his life and headed for the safety of his vehicle.\"\u00a0 \"He proceeded a short distance before being swarmed by Sheriff vehicles and being ripped out of his car. He had no idea the two men running at him were Sheriff Officers. He is unaware of how anyone sustained injury,\" Gelormino said.\u00a0 Presti's lawyer accused the deputies of not following proper procedures.\u00a0 \"They are clearly untrained and outside their element,\" he said. \"I urge the City to immediately institute a training program for this Department before more people are injured.\"\u00a0 Gelormino said he hopes to have Presti out by noon on Sunday. Presti was previously arrested Tuesday night after the bar continued serving\u00a0patrons indoors and operating past the 10 p.m. curfew for restaurant service that Cuomo imposed citywide. The sheriff's office said plainclothes officers were able to go inside and order food and beverages at the time.\u00a0 The tavern is in an area designated by Cuomo as an \u201corange zone\u201d because of spiking COVID-19 rates and was not supposed to be serving customers indoors. But Presti and his\u00a0business partner Keith McAlarney\u00a0had deemed it an \"Autonomous Zone\"\u00a0in the spirit of this summer's \"CHAZ\" enclave in Seattle. Many businesses \u2013\u00a0particularly restaurants and bars \u2013\u00a0have been impacted severely by government-mandated closures in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 Supporters of Presti gathered outside the bar Wednesday in protest of his arrest and Cuomo's orders. Presti told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d following his first arrest that he wouldn\u2019t stop fighting to save his business. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"At this point,\" Presti said, \"we are losing faith, and kind of lost faith in the ability for our local and city governments to help us.\" Fox News' Maria Paronich, Caleb Parke and\u00a0Charles Creitz, along with the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Zients will be tasked with overseeing the rollout of the vaccine and mobilizing economic aid, among other priorities.\u00a0 Under President Obama, Zients served as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0 Democratic consulting firm Saguaro Strategies scrubbed the page over the summer and fall as Zients\u2019 profile rose after he joined the Biden transition team. The firm made the changes using the name \u201cSaguarostrat,\u201d with the intent to clean up anything that could be politically damaging.

The section has been deleted.\u00a0 Politico reports that one section -- where Zients spoke highly of the management consulting firm Bain -- was removed\u00a0but as of this writing it has returned.

At the top of the section about Zients\u2019 role advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has seen left-wing opposition, the firm added Zients\u2019 argument that it was \u201cthe most progressive trade agreement there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u00a0 As of this writing, that section has been removed.

But as he answered questions from reporters on Friday, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t make vaccines and masks mandatory. BIDEN TO CALL DURING INAUGURATION FOR 100 DAYS OF WEARING MASKS And the president-elect, who spoke\u00a0in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., called Friday\u2019s unemployment report \u201cgrim.\u201d He urged Congress and President Trump to immediately pass a COVID-19 relief measure and warned that \u201cthe future will be very bleak\u201d without such a deal. Biden was asked if taking the vaccine should be mandated for Americans. \u201cI don't think it should be mandatory, I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power -- it's like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide,\u201d Biden replied. And he vowed that he\u2019d \u201cdo everything in my power as president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That\u2019s why I said in my inaugural speech I\u2019m going to ask people to commit to 100 days to wear a mask.\u201d WHERE THE CDC SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD WEAR A MASK The president-elect predicted that \u201cif people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will still be a raging crisis, and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they\u2019re going to see deaths drop off the edge. They\u2019re going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick. And my hope is they\u2019ll then be inclined to say \u2018it\u2019s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people.\u2019\u201d Biden emphasized that when it comes to distributing the vaccines across the country, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more that has to be done.\u201d He said that Trump administration officials have \u201cclued us in our their plan on how they plan to distribute the actual vaccine to the various states but there is no detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen anywhere as to how do you get the vaccine out of a container and into an injection syringe into somebody\u2019s arm. And it\u2019s going to be very difficult for that to be done and it\u2019s a very expensive proposition.\u201d Biden noted that he agrees with the priorities \u201claid out so far\u201d by the Trump administration that those who would receive the vaccines first would be \u201cfirst responders and those in nursing homes and in-home care, the first people on the list.\u201d But he added that \u201cthere has to be some equity in how this is distributed\u201d as he stressed that officials have to figure out how to get the vaccine to minority communities hard hit by the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Biden added. And the president-elect touted that \u201cI think that my taking the vaccine and people seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence.\u201d Taking aim at President Trump, Biden argued that \u201cit\u2019s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it\u2019s been so diminished in this administration thus far.\u201d More than 276,000 deaths throughout\u00a0the country have been tied to the coronavirus since the pandemic swept the nation in February and March, with more than 14.2 million COVID-19 cases in total. There has been a surge in cases throughout much of the nation during the past month. NEW JOBS REPORT SUGGESTS CORONAVIRUS SURGE THREATENING ECONOMIC RECOVERY Speaking hours after the Labor Department reported that jobs increased by 245,000 in November, down from 610,000 in October, Biden described the report as \u201cdire\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d  \u00a0\u201cIt shows an economy that\u2019s stalling,\u201d he said. But he said that if the government reacts now, \u201cwe can regain begin to regain momentum.\u201d But Biden warned that \u201cthere\u2019s no time to lose. Millions of people have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed. They\u2019ve lost their health insurance or are in danger of losing their health insurance. One in every six renters is behind in rent. One in four small businesses can\u2019t keep their doors open.\u201d Biden called on Congress and the president \u201cto act and act now\u201d and warned that \u201cif Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits they rely on. Merry Christmas.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the future will be very bleak. Americans need help and they need it now. And they need more to come early next year,\u201d he added. The president-elect said he was encouraged by a proposed $908 billion bipartisan framework in the Senate and said it showed that both parties can work together.  Biden said that coronavirus stimulus checks for. families \u201cmay be still in play.\u201d He added that \u201cI think it would be better if they had the $1,200\" payments to families. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top two Democrats in Congress, have backed the deal heading into talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden twice dodged questions on whether he's talked yet with McConnell, the top Republican on Capitol Hill. Then-Vice President Biden and McConnell had a history of striking deals to avert fiscal catastrophes during the Obama administration. \u201cMcConnell knows me,\u201d Biden noted. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m straight as an arrow.\u201d Biden also characterized the bipartisan proposal as \u201cjust a down payment\u201d and once again promised to push for more coronavirus relief aid when his administration takes over next month. The president-elect was also asked about pressure from Democrats to name a more diverse cabinet and administration. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see significant diversity,\u201d Biden said.

    "article_text": "Pelosi on reason for shift to supporting smaller coronavirus relief: 'New president' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Friday that she was willing to move forward with a smaller coronavirus relief package\u00a0with President-elect Biden headed to the White House and a vaccine on the way. Pelosi previously encountered criticism for not supporting a moderate Democratic proposal, insisting on a much larger price tag. The current proposal from the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of 25 Republicans and 25 Democrats working to find bipartisan solutions, is $908 billion, significantly less than the $1.5 trillion proposed before the election. In October, the White House had also proposed a $1.8 trillion package, roughly twice the size of the one Pelosi is now backing. When asked about her shift on supporting the much smaller package, Pelosi cited \"a new president and a vaccine.\" She added that the current proposal \"has simplicity, it's what we had in our bills, it's for a shorter period of time, but that's O.K.\u00a0now because we have a new president.\" MODERATE DEMOCRATS PRESSURE PELOSI, HOUSE LEADERSHIP TO MOVE NEW CORONAVIRUS BILL: 'STOP THE STUPIDITY' Pelosi also clashed with a CNN reporter who asked whether it was a mistake not to accept a scaled-down relief package.\u00a0 \"I'm going to tell you something,\" she said, pointing her finger. \"Don't characterize what we did before as a mistake, as a preface to your question, if you want an answer. That was not a mistake. It was a decision, and it has taken us to a place where we can do the right thing without other,\u00a0shall we say, considerations in the legislation that we don't want.\" The election of Joe Biden as president means Democrats don\u2019t necessarily feel they have to hold out to get everything they want in one bill since they view Biden as a willing partner to pass additional COVID-19 relief if needed next year. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus that backed the $908 billion bill said he\u2019s been telling colleagues this legislation is an \u201cemergency relief short-term package\u201d to get businesses and families through the tough winter months, and not the last chance at COVID relief. \u201cThis is just \u2026 a down payment but it covers the major priorities that we have to address right now,\u201d Gottheimer told Fox News. Biden similarly said this week that the scaled back relief was a \"down payment.\"\u00a0 The Speaker's comments came after months of stalled negotiations and as both sides underscored the consequences of delaying relief. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had wanted to stick to a roughly $500 billion package that he said President Trump would sign into law. McConnell shot down the $980 billion package, saying on Tuesday,\u00a0\"We just don't have time to waste time.\" CLICK HERE TO GET COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE In backing the recent proposal, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said \"the need to act is immediate.\" \"In the spirit of compromise, we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" the two said in a joint statement. \"Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.\"",

In a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published Friday, the health agency warned that the country has entered into a \u201cphase of high-level transmission\u201d of the novel coronavirus. \u201cWith colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons, the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential,\u201d the report said. Other strategies in addition to face mask use include maintaining physical distance and limiting in-person contact, avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, contact tracing, safeguarding high-risk individuals, protecting essential workers, postponing travel, increasing room air ventilation and practicing hand hygiene, as well as widespread availability of a vaccine. ITALY BANS MIDNIGHT MASS AT CHRISTMAS \u201cIn combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s economic impact,\u201d the report said. The agency noted that stopping the spread is essential to keeping businesses and schools open. The report was also careful to note that N95 respirators should be reserved for health care workers and other medical responders, but that cloth masks or nonmedical disposable masks, when used correctly, would suffice. CDC DIRECTOR OKS CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN \u201cFace mask use is most important in indoor spaces and outdoors when physical distance of 6 feet cannot be maintained,\u201d the report said. \u201cWithin households, face masks should be used when a member of the household is infected or has had recent potential COVID-19 exposure.\u201d Mask use has been a hot topic of debate as of late, with President-elect Joe Biden indicating that one of his first priorities would be to implement mask mandates nationwide. However, Fox News\u2019 Dr. Marc Siegel said such a mandate could backfire, and \u201cmay actually lead to more of a rebellion against it.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The report comes on the same day that CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield approved a panel advisory plan for vaccine distribution, with the initial limited supply of the eventual vaccine to given to health care workers and long-term care facilities.

    "article_text": "Moderna coronavirus vaccine offers immunity for at least 3 months, researchers suggest Biotech company Moderna has shared findings that\u00a0its coronavirus vaccine offered trial participants\u00a0immunity up to three months after the second jab.\u00a0 The vaccine still awaits emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which plans to meet on Dec. 17 to discuss the company's application. The FDA will meet on Dec. 10 to discuss\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. In the meantime, state leaders and health officials\u00a0have begun announcing that initial doses of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0vaccines, namely that of Pfizer,\u00a0are expected in the coming weeks pending the FDA's approval.\u00a0 HOW DO THE MODERNA AND PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINES COMPARE? A team of doctors involved with the clinical trial for Moderna\u2019s vaccine published correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, detailing findings among 34 healthy adult participants. The jab involves a two-dose regimen, administered 28 days apart. At the 100-microgram (\u03bcg) dose, the vaccine \u201cproduced high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies that declined slightly over time, as expected, but they remained elevated in all participants 3 months after the booster [second] vaccination,\u201d the doctors wrote. The levels of antibodies among trial participants also \"exceeded\" that of 41 recovering COVID-19 patients in a control group. Adults aged 18 to 55 saw the highest levels of antibodies, followed by the eldest participants (aged over 71), and finally, those aged 56 to 70. The team reported no serious adverse events, \"and no new adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the vaccine occurred after day 57.\" UK DEFENDS PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DECISION AMID CRITICISM IT MOVED TOO FAST Researchers say it is \u201cnot yet established\u201d whether the antibodies translate to protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the results do imply that the vaccine has the potential to offer \u201cdurable immunity\u201d against disease. \u201cOur findings provide support for the use of a 100-\u03bcg dose of mRNA-1273 in an ongoing phase 3 trial, which has recently shown a 94.5% efficacy rate in an interim analysis,\u201d researchers concluded.

The grim milestone comes as health officials warned of surges tied to holiday travel and lockdown fatigue. The numbers had been steadily increasing \u2013 minus a slight dip on Nov. 27 -- since the end of October, but the increase of some 60,000 in a matter of weeks marks the steepest spike the country has seen yet, according to data collected by The COVID Tracking Project. \u00a0 Hope has been hinged on the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine, but the FDA is not scheduled to meet to discuss Pfizer\u2019s application for emergency use authorization until Dec. 10. A meeting to decide on Moderna\u2019s application will be held a week later. Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, has warned that the vaccine will not be the ultimate end to the pandemic. He has called for increased public health measures in an effort to stifle the spread before the vaccine is approved. He noted that it\u2019s not clear what impact \u2013 if any \u2013 the vaccine will have on the transmission of the virus, as the candidates have been evaluated to see if they prevent clinically apparent or severe disease among vaccinated individuals. \u201cThe issue is that you\u2019re not going to be completely protected against a degree of infection that you might not even notice \u2013 that you might be able to spread to others,\u201d Fauci said, while participating in a virtual discussion with The Hastings Center. \u201cWhich is the reason why the message you may have heard me say over the last couple weeks in the media is that getting vaccinated with a highly efficacious vaccine does not mean that you\u2019re going to abandon completely public health measures.\u201d Across the nation, health systems have warned about nearing or reaching full capacity due to the novel coronavirus, with the Mayo Clinic going so far as to set up emergency room beds in the ambulance garage.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,\u00a0said the chamber will be considering multiple bills, including the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, and voting will take place Wednesday through Friday. Another bill that will be reviewed, seeks to ban breeding and private ownership of big cats, which were featured in the Netflix docuseries \u201cTiger King\u201d earlier this year. BIDEN SAYS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE DURING LAME-DUCK PERIOD LIKELY 'JUST A START' But Republican\u2019s, many of whom are staunch critics of marijuana legalization\u00a0despite it being legal in\u00a0many of their states, took to Twitter to accuse Pelosi, D-Calif., of prioritizing \u201ccannabis and cats\u201d over finding a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill.\u00a0 \u201cThis week, your House Democrat majority is tackling the tough issues by holding a vote on legalizing pot and banning tiger ownership,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote Monday on Twitter. \u201cNothing for small businesses. Nothing for re-opening schools. Nothing on battling the pandemic. Just cannabis and cats.\u201d Though while the House will not be voting on COVID-19 relief funding this week, the speaker said she spoke with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about the \u201cbipartisan progress\u201d that has been made in finding a solution, which\u00a0attempts the marry both the Democrats and Republican\u2019s stubborn demands. A coronavirus stimulus package has been held up for months largely because Democrats are seeking\u00a0a roughly $2.2 trillion package, while Republicans do not want to spend more than $500 billion on\u00a0aid, which is an impasse that has resulted in the rejection of several relief packages from both sides of the aisle. \u00a0 After speaking with President-elect Joe Biden, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have said it is a priority to get a stimulus package passed during Congress\u2019 lame-duck session. \u201cSecretary Mnuchin said he would be reviewing the proposal Leader Schumer and I made to Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy last night and the bipartisan Senate proposal unveiled today,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cAdditional COVID relief is long overdue and must be passed in this lame duck session.\" The decision to vote on the MORE Act is not as unexpected as some Republican lawmakers apparently believe\u00a0it to be, as it was on the chamber's docket in September. MCCONNELL PLANS FOR NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SIGN INTO LAW But some centrist-Democratic lawmakers feared that passing the federal legalization of weed prior to the election, when COVID-19 legislation had failed, may play badly with voters, the Marijuana Movement reported earlier this year. \u201cThe MORE Act remains a critical component of House Democrats\u2019 plan for addressing systemic racism and advancing criminal justice reform, and we are committed to bringing it to the Floor for a vote before the end of the year,\u201d Hoyer said in a statement, according to the publication. \u00a0\u201cRight now, the House is focused relentlessly on securing agreement to stave off a damaging government shutdown and continuing to do its job addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Though congressional Republicans largely remain opposed to legalizing marijuana, two staunchly conservative states voted to legalize the plant for medical use on Election Day. Mississippi and South Dakota passed legislation that permits the medicinal use of marijuana, joining 34 other states.

But\u00a0they all got tagged with it.\" Manchin also rebuked Ocasio-Cortez's \"Medicare for all\" vision.\u00a0 AOC HITS JOE MANCHIN WITH A STONE-COLD DEATH STARE AFTER MODERATE DEM OPPOSES 'CRAZY SOCIALIST AGENDA' \"We can't even pay for Medicare for some,\" Manchin said. \"Don\u2019t you think we should fix the system we have now?\" As for the Green New Deal, Manchin said what's important is that\u00a0America is energy independent. \"We want a clean environment but we also want a balance between the environment and economy. We think that can be done. You can't do it if you\u2019re so rigid.\" A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez, Lauren Hitt, didn't offer a new response\u00a0on Manchin's remarks. But she defended Ocasio-Cortez's legislative record to the New York Times, pointing out the congresswoman has missed fewer votes than Manchin and authored more amendments than 90 percent of other freshmen.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe congresswoman has earned a reputation as a tough, prepared member in committee hearings,\u201d Hitt told the newspaper. AOC RIPS MSNBC'S CLAIRE MCCASKILL: 'WHY DO WE LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO LOST ELECTIONS?' Ocasio-Cortez has previously hit back on the accusation that the squad was the reason for Democrats losing House seats. She said moderates who are blaming progressives for their struggling campaigns had \"awful execution\" of digital campaigning during a pandemic and called out the need for year-round organizing.\u00a0 She said swing seat Democrats who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and Medicare for All won re-election.\u00a0 \"So the whole 'progressivism is bad' argument just doesn't have any compelling evidence that I've seen,\" she tweeted after the election.\u00a0 As for coronavirus relief, Ocasio-Cortez has been advocating for a big package that includes mortgage and rent relief, expanded health care, stopping student loan payments and $2,000 in monthly reoccurring payments to all families\u00a0and $1,000 per child -- regardless of immigration status. She's urged the squad to play\u00a0\"hardball\" to get bigger relief packages. GEORGIA REP.-ELECT CAROLYN BOURDEAUX, ONLY DEMOCRAT TO FLIP SEAT, SAYS PARTY SHOULD TALK TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS In meantime, she's been raising private funds to help constituents in her district. Most recently she raised $240,000 in donations to support six eviction defense and food relief programs in New York. The bulk of the money was raised during a\u00a0five-hour Twitch live stream playing the online game Among Us. Though they represent opposite ends of the party, Manchin said he's open to talking to Ocasio-Cortez and getting to know her.\u00a0 \"I'd be happy to.\u00a0I talk to everybody,\" Manchin said. \"I\u00a0don't have any problems -- I just never had the opportunity to sit down and speak to her.\"",

    "article_text": "CDC to release revised guidance reducing COVID-19 quarantine time from 14 days to 7-10 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to release revised guidance on quarantine time for those who may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus from 14 days to 7 days, for those who have received a negative test, and 10 days for those who have not been tested, Fox News has learned. Fox News obtained an internal CDC document on Tuesday which outlined the proposed changes. A source told Fox News that the changes have been discussed with and approved by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. DR. SCOTT ATLAS RESIGNS AS SPECIAL ADVISER TO TRUMP ON CORONAVIRUS The CDC is expected to release the revised guidance on Wednesday, a source told Fox News. \u201cQuarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they have the virus,\u201d the document states. \u201cCDC and other scientists have explored changing the current recommendation to quarantine for 14 days.\u201d \u201cReducing the length of quarantine may increase compliance by reducing economic hardship,\u201d the document continues. \u201cIn addition, the reduction in time will lessen stress on the public health system, especially when new infections are rapidly rising.\u201d The document states that \u201cbased on local resources, quarantine can end on Day 7 after receiving a negative test result\u201d or on \u201cDay 10 without testing.\u201d \u201cAfter stopping quarantine, you should: watch for symptoms until 14 days after exposure; if you have symptoms, immediately self-isolate and contact your local public health authority or healthcare provider; wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands, avoid crowds, and take other steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201d the document states. The document adds, however, that the CDC \u201ccontinues to recommend quarantine for 14 days to more completely reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\u201d \u201cCDC recognizes that any quarantine shorter than 14 days balances reduced burden against a small possibility of spreading the virus,\u201d the document states. \u201cThese recommendations are based on what we know now.\u201d The document added that: \u201cCDC will continue to evaluate new information and update recommendations as needed.\u201d COVID-19 VACCINES WILL BE READY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF FDA APPROVAL, AZAR SAYS A senior administration official told Fox News that the revised guidance\u00a0is \u201clong overdue,\u201d and \u201csomething that should have happened sooner.\u201d The official told Fox News that the CDC's revised recommendations were guided by extensive modeling studies by CDC scientists, as well as scientists from outside the agency. The official said that the risk of COVID transmission remains the \"lowest with 14 days of quarantine,\" but that the new options introduce an estimated 1% \"residual risk\" if quarantine is shorted to 10 days, and 5% residual risk of quarantine is reduced to 7 days, if you also add a test.\u00a0 The official said that the \"small amount of increased risk\" with these new options \"needs to be weighed against the benefits of reduced economic hardship,\u00a0reduced stress on the public health system, and better compliance with quarantine and contact tracing that could improve overall control of new infections.\"\u00a0 The revised guidance, expected to be announced on Wednesday, comes as the Trump administration said deliveries of a COVID-19\u00a0vaccine\u00a0will begin as early as this week, and would be available first for front-line workers, medical personnel and senior citizens. Next week, regulators at the Food and Drug Administration are expected to review\u00a0Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization\u00a0for its vaccine developed with BioNTech.\u00a0 The latest trial data for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine,\u00a0unveiled earlier this month, showed it was 90% effective. In addition, Moderna said\u00a0its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19. AstraZeneca also\u00a0reported preliminary results\u00a0that showed its vaccine efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, depending on the dosage amount given to participants. According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the vaccines will be \u201cshipped\u201d within 24 hours of FDA approval and then it would be up to \u201cnursing homes, hospitals, and pharmacies to get that dispensed.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt really could be within days of FDA approval we\u2019ll start seeing vaccines in people\u2019s arms which is frankly incredible,\u201d Azar said Monday. The United States has reported more than 13.5 million cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and more than 267,000 deaths.",

Both companies have developed coronavirus vaccine candidates that\u00a0have proven over 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials.\u00a0 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MRNA VACCINES AND CONVENTIONAL ONES? Following FDA approval, the first Americans could receive the jab as early as this month. There are roughly 21 million health care workers and some 3 million long-term care facility residents in the U.S., according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the CDC's\u00a0independent vaccine advisory committee.\u00a0 \"To date, more than 240,000 healthcare workers have contracted COVID-19\u00a0and 858 have died. According to estimates, deaths in long-term care facilities account for 40 percent of all COVID-19 deaths nationwide.\u00a0These factors contributed to the committee\u2019s recommendation to prevent spread by protecting those on the front lines, healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients, and protect the most vulnerable, those elderly persons living in long-term care facilities,\" the CDC told Fox News in an emailed\u00a0statement following the vote.\u00a0 WHEN WILL MODERNA'S CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BE READY TO SHIP? \"The committee intends to meet again following [the FDA] authorization or approval for vaccine-specific recommendations,\" the statement added.\u00a0 States are not required to follow the\u00a0CDC's recommendations; the recommendations simply provide a framework. However, most states are expected to follow the recommendations, one expert said. Moderna, the latest\u00a0contender to\u00a0announce the filing of\u00a0emergency use authorization\u00a0(EUA)\u00a0for its\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0vaccine, said on Monday that it expects to have 20 million doses of its vaccine available in the U.S. by the end of the year, adding that it \"remains on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021.\" CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Pfizer, meanwhile,\u00a0has previously said it expects to produce up to 50 million doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. The news comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday\u00a0that a decision on Moderna\u2019s application for EUA will likely be made days or up to a week after Pfizer\u2019s is considered on Dec. 10. CORONAVIRUS VACCINE WON'T MEAN END OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES, FAUCI SAYS Azar added that the vaccines will \u201cship 24 hours after authorization,\u201d meaning the country is potentially on track to see a vaccine distributed before Christmas.

    "article_text": "Students failing more often during coronavirus virtual learning: study As coronavirus cases spike across the U.S., local and state officials are implementing new lockdown restrictions, including those on schools. Some schools in states from Connecticut\u00a0to California that switched from virtual learning in the spring to in-person or hybrid learning by autumn are moving back to online classes as cases spike, and it\u2019s taking a toll on students, parents and teachers. A new study from Fairfax County, Va., Public Schools Office of Research and Strategic Improvement suggests middle and high school students are seeing less academic success as a result of online learning. The county's schools remain closed, and parents protested calls to keep learning virtual during a Nov. 12 demonstration, according to WJLA. The percentage of students with two or more F marks, for example, increased 83% from 6% to 11%\u00a0in the first quarter of the 2020-2021 school year compared to the first quarter of the 2019-2020 school year.\u00a0 DE BLASIO TO REOPEN NYC SCHOOLS, SAYS HE HEARD PARENTS 'LOUD AND CLEAR' Students with disabilities and non-English speakers experienced the largest increase in F marks.\u00a0 \u201cStudents at the middle school level had a notable increase in the percentage of failures, while at the high school level the increase also existed but was considerably smaller,\u201d the study reads. \u201c...The trend of more failing marks is concerning across the board but is especially concerning for the groups that showed the biggest unpredicted increases in receiving multiple unsatisfactory marks, namely our English learner students and students with disabilities.\u201d ADRIANA COHEN: GIVE TEACHERS PRIORITY FOR COVID-19 VACCINATIONS SO SCHOOLS CAN REOPEN Similar research conducted in California and Texas also found that students were failing more frequently as a result of virtual learning. A return to virtual learning will also be hard on working parents who have been forced to change schedules and seek help looking after their children as they learn from remote locations. Parents have organized protests to keep schools open in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Arizona and other states. While educators and school staff may be at a substantially greater risk of contracting COVID-19 in schools, students \u2013\u00a0especially those in elementary school \u2013\u00a0do not appear to be virus superspreaders, according to new research.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to run through the end of the year,\u201d a private school teacher and mother of two from Southern California who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with\u00a0her school\u2019s guidelines\u00a0told Fox News of the pandemic.\u00a0 TEACHERS UNIONS ACROSS US DEMAND STOP TO IN-PERSON LEARNING AMID RISING CORONAVIRUS CASES \u201cWhen I figured I was going to do distance learning, I thought I was only going to have to do it for a month, so, if I had known what PTSD it would have caused me ... I would have just used my savings to put [my son] in day care,\u201d she said. The teacher \u2013\u00a0who specializes in teaching kindergarten\u00a0through fifth-grade students primarily with reading disabilities and ADHD \u2013\u00a0said that while her school was closed, she would teach virtual classes while taking care of her toddler-aged son at the same time because the preschool she usually sends him to was also closed while she was working from home. The difficulty many parents are facing is a lack of overlap with COVID-19 restrictions among\u00a0schools, care facilities and their jobs.\u00a0 \u201cThey weren\u2019t kidding when they said it takes a village to raise your children. \u2026 I didn\u2019t have family. I had nobody,\u201d she said. She added that elementary-school children are facing depression due to the\u00a0lack of social interaction they normally get at school. Her own children were \u201cthrilled\u201d to return to school in the fall. The teacher said some of her own students misbehave whether parents are present or not and sometimes act whinier when parents are present during a virtual lesson.\u00a0 CORONAVIRUS DELAYS NATIONAL MATH, READING TESTS UNTIL 2022 \u201cThey actually regressed when I tested them in the fall when they came back to school because \u2026 for kids who were defiant or had learning differences, their parents didn\u2019t know how to help them, so they didn\u2019t have a proper education for six months until they went back into school in the fall,\u201d she said. Some students, especially young ones\u00a0who are learning important developmental skills like basic writing and reading,\u00a0will show \u201clagging skills\u201d and other long-term effects of falling behind due to virtual learning in the future once the pandemic comes under control, she said. \"Anything that should have been mastered in the spring \u2013\u00a0if you're not a self-directed, independent learner \u2013\u00a0you didn't have a chance to do that. That's been the pattern that I see, that a lot of these kids didn't get the chance to practice mastery and the skills they should've mastered so that now they can build on and learn more.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Most of California\u2019s 6 million public school students remain at home under the direction of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, even as his own children receive in-person private educations, according to Politico. \"For the sake of the kids, I hope it doesn't happen, but for the sake of the teachers who are at risk, I hope the schools are able to manage ... what's possible and comfortable for everybody,\" she said of a potential\u00a0return\u00a0to online learning.\u00a0",

President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, called Dr. Stephen Hahn to brief officials at 9:30 a.m., on the same day that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel is scheduled to meet regarding vaccine distribution plans. The FDA is scheduled to meet on Dec. 10 regarding Pfizer\u2019s application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its coronavirus vaccine, three weeks after the company filed for it. The FDA plans to meet on Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna's EUA. Critics have questioned the delay in scheduling, including Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary, who said the agency is being \u201ctoo bureaucratic.\u201d \u201cThe FDA has been too bureaucratic, taking too much time,\u201d Makary said Monday, while appearing on \u201cBill Hemmer Reports.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re scheduling around vacation times and tee times of the reviewers, but they should turn the application around in 24 hours.\u201d DR.

Atlas, who spoke with the president on Monday, joined the administration in August, and was considered a Special Government Employee (SGE), serving a 130-day detail. Atlas\u2019 role is set to expire this week. COVID-19 VACCINES WILL BE READY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF FDA APPROVAL, AZAR SAYS Fox News exclusively obtained Atlas\u2019s resignation letter Monday, which was dated Dec. 1. In it,\u00a0Atlas touted the Trump administration's work on the coronavirus pandemic, while wishing \"all the\u00a0best\" to the incoming Biden administration. \u201cI am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,\u201d Atlas said, thanking him for \u201cthe honor and privilege to serve on behalf of the American people.\u201d \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus\u2014to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Atlas wrote, adding that he \u201calways relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d \u201cAs time went on, like all scientists and health policy scholars, I learned new information and synthesized the latest data from around the world, all in an effort to provide you with the best information to serve the greater public good,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cBut, perhaps more than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor.\u201d Atlas, who had been criticized throughout his tenure for calling for a reopening, and saying that lockdowns are \u201cextremely harmful\u201d to Americans, said that \u201calthough some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of a civilized society.\u201d \u201cIndeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent,\u201d Atlas said. Atlas went on to tout his work at the White House, and his work with \u201cseveral selfless colleagues in designing specific policies to heighten protection of the vulnerable while safely reopening schools and society.\u201d Atlas pointed to their efforts in increasing and prioritizing \u201cextra personal protective equipment and tens of millions of extra tests to nursing and assisted living facilities,\u201d as well as implementing \u201cmore frequent monitoring updates using clinical guidelines to intensify testing,\u201d and instituting outreach to independent seniors in communities. \u201cWe also successfully designed rational guidelines for safely opening schools, a strategic use of the newly developed testing program, and a national stockpile of drugs for future crises,\u201d Atlas wrote. Shifting to lockdowns he has warned against throughout his tenure, Atlas said they \u201cidentified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children.\u201d \u201cAnd more and more, the relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged,\u201d Atlas added. ATLAS FIRES BACK AGAINST CRITICISMS, SAYS ADVICE BASED ON 'CURRENT SCIENCE' Atlas also touted Operation Warp Speed, and the team that \u201cdelivered on our promised timelines for new drugs and vaccines.\u201d \u201cI congratulate you for your vision, and also congratulate the many who did the exemplory work\u2014we know who they are, even though their names are not those familiar to the public,\u201d Atlas wrote. Atlas went on to wish the best to the incoming Biden Administration. \u201cI sincerely wish the new team all the best as they guide the nation through these trying, polarized times,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cWith the emerging treatments and vaccines, I remain highly optimistic that America will thrive once again and overcome the adversity of the pandemic and all that it has entailed.\u201d Atlas, during his tenure, sparred with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Over the summer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield reportedly criticized Atlas, claiming that \u201ceverything he says is false.\u201d Atlas defended his record and his expertise, and maintained that all of his advice to the president was based on the \u201ccurrent science.\u201d \u201cI was asked to be an adviser on the coronavirus pandemic to the president of the United States and I was asked to do that because I have a 25-year career at top, elite medical centers, as a doctor and in patient care,\u201d Atlas told Fox News this summer. \u201cI also have a 15-year career in public policy, working on health care policy and integrating my medical knowledge in policy.\u201d Atlas added that before his arrival to the White House this summer, \u201cthat expertise had not been present.\u201d \u201cI am here because I understand how to translate complex medical science into plain English for the president of the United States and for everyone else in the White House, and derive\u00a0appropriate public policy from that information,\u201d Atlas said at the time, adding that there is a \u201cfalse belief\u201d that one \u201chas to be a public health official to understand the facts about the pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe way I advise the president is perfectly consistent with the most appropriate strategy for dealing with this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, target diligent protection of the high risk and vulnerable populations, and two, open up schools and society.\u201d Meanwhile, as for a coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration said deliveries of the vaccine will begin as early as this week, and would be available first for front-line workers, medical personnel and senior citizens. The president, on Thanksgiving, argued that his opponent, President-elect Joe\u00a0Biden, should not be given credit for the vaccines, which he referred to as a \"medical miracle\"\u00a0before repeating claims of voting irregularities in the 2020 election. \"Joe Biden failed with the swine flu, H1N1, totally failed with the swine flu,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Don't let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me and I pushed people harder than they've ever been pushed before and we got that approved and through and nobody's ever seen anything like it.\"\u00a0 Trump's comments came ahead of a\u00a0Dec. 10 meeting, where regulators at the Food and Drug Administration will review\u00a0Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine developed with BioNTech.\u00a0 The latest trial data for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine,\u00a0unveiled earlier this month, showed it was 90% effective. In addition, Moderna said its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19. AstraZeneca also reported preliminary results that showed its vaccine efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, depending on the dosage amount given to participants. According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the vaccines will be \u201cshipped\u201d within 24 hours of FDA approval and then it would be up to \u201cnursing homes, hospitals, and pharmacies to get that dispensed.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt really could be within days of FDA approval we\u2019ll start seeing vaccines in people\u2019s arms which is frankly incredible,\u201d Azar said Monday. The United States has reported more than 13.5 million cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and more than 267,000 deaths.",

    "article_text": "U.S. healthcare workers prepare for potential COVID-19 vaccine As federal officials ramp up efforts to make a coronavirus vaccine available to the public, state health departments are starting to prepare hospitals for the first shipments. On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the CDC Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. He said the first batch of vaccines, produced by Pfizer, could be approved for use in the United States before Christmas. \u201cWe actually believe that from the moment we receive FDA approval, which we think is likely sometime in the week of December 14, we could be shipping within the first 24 hours,\u201d the vice president stated. \u201cAnd we could be vaccinating people within 24 hours of that.\u201d He added that within 48 hours, vaccinations would likely be available to all 50 states and territories across the country. The FDA is expected to approve Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine on December 10. Recent trials suggested the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective. Pending regulatory approval, the vaccines will be transported in giant dry-ice filled containers at a temperature of 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important for these containers is you have the capability to get them plugged in when they\u2019re not actually in transit,\u201d Roger Samways, American Airlines\u2019 Vice President of Cargo, stated. \u201cWe\u2019ve got capability here to plug in 50 containers at any one time.\u201d Pfizer is expected to have 6.4 million doses of vaccine ready by mid-December. In Michigan, Henry Ford Health System noted that they are fully prepared to deploy the coronavirus vaccine as soon as it\u2019s approved for use, which will bring relief to healthcare workers around the nation. \u201cAt Henry Ford Health System, we have been preparing to get the vaccines and have been watching the guidelines very closely,\u201d Dr. Adnan Munkarah stated. \u201cWe have prepared from an operational perspective to make sure that we are able to store the vaccines.\u201d Dr. Munkarah also added that Henry Ford Health System installed freezers that are capable to freeze both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Vaccine priority will be given to frontline healthcare workers and nursing homes. Amid each of these developments, Vice President Pence is optimistic moving forward. \u201cThis time of year is always filled with hope through faith, traditions and in the hearts of the American people,\u201d Pence stated. \u201cBut to be just a week and a half away from what will be the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine is inspiring the people of this country.\u201d \u00a0",

    "article_text": "White House advisors optimistic about economic progress amid pandemic As the U.S. economy continues to feel the effects of the pandemic, the Labor Department\u2019s November unemployment report revealed slower job growth than expected. Jobless claims fell from 6.9 to 6.7 percent, which added 245,000 jobs to the economy. However, this was 50 percent lower than what was originally forecasted. On Friday, Chief White House Economist Joe Lavorgna spoke to One America News and emphasized that the Labor Bureau\u2019s data still included many positive reports. \u201cWe\u2019re down 54 percent from where we were in April,\u201d Lavorgna stated. \u201cWithin that number, private employment rose almost 500,000, which is fantastic.\u201d He added that major minority groups have seen unemployment rates fall as well. Lavorgna noted the country\u2019s GDP growth is up 11 percent, emphasizing that the U.S. economy looks \u201cawfully powerful.\u201d Meanwhile, various states and local governments have implemented further restrictions as coronavirus cases surge. However, Lavorgna stated that investors are looking past any temporary economic slowdowns due to vaccine developments. The White House economist also discussed the prospects of a stimulus bill. He said the government would like to offer more help to the American people for COVID-19 testing and paycheck protection. \u201cNegotiations are continuing, which is good, but we\u2019d certainly like to give people extra assistance even though we\u2019re in this \u2018V-shaped boom,'\u201d Lavorgna stated. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot of hardship and pain out there and if we can do more to help people that is what we\u2019ve always tried to do.\u201d In the meantime, Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow displayed optimism about the U.S. economy. On Friday, Kudlow said the economy has come back strong. Although 10 million Americans remain jobless, he noted it\u2019s lower than the unemployment rate at the start of the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 150 million Americans working and that\u2019s way up,\u201d Kudlow emphasized. \u201cThe 10 million who are unemployed is way down.\u201d These improvements come as unemployment benefits are set to expire by the end of the year, which puts pressure on Congress and the White House to pass a new stimulus package by January.",

On Thursday, the Portsmouth School Board voted eight-to-one to put nearly $450,000 toward the renaming of two elementary schools and one high school.  The schools were named after several historical figures with ties to slavery and segregation, including former presidents Woodrow Wilson and John Tyler. However, some board members worried the project would sink the district\u2019s budget. \u201cI was a student at Manor when it changed to Wilson,\u201d Portsmouth School Boardmember Sarah Hinds stated. \u201cI lived through the piecemeal-put-together of creating a new school and I don\u2019t want to put another class or two of students through that at this point.\u201d The dissenting board member argued the money should go to resources for students instead of renaming the schools. Meanwhile, the schools will begin the renaming process on July 1.",

While talking to reporters Thursday, the President confirmed he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d sign a deal when he gets a chance. Congress has been at in impasse for months over a stimulus bill and time is quickly running out for lawmakers to pass legislation before the end of the year. Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of legislatures unveiled a $900 billion package in hopes of moving the ball forward. Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer appeared supportive of the bill as a good place to start negotiations. However, Republicans were far more apprehensive of the bill with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stating he, instead, supports Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s proposal to attach COVID relief funding to the end-of-year budget. \u201cWorking with President Trump, with (Steven) Mnuchin and with McConnell, I feel we\u2019ve got a better opportunity now than at any time,\u201d McCarthy stated. \u201cI think those members on the Democratic side who said they would sign a discharge petition, if they would sign that discharge petition I bet you would get a COVID bill that day.\u201d  McConnell said he\u2019s seeing good indicators both sides can come to a compromise in time. \u201cNow it\u2019s been heartening to see a few hopeful signs in the past few days,\u201d he stated. \u201cAfter months of arbitrary attachment to sky-high dollar amounts the Speaker of the House claimed were essential, that it would be an insult to settle for a nickel less, those baseless claims have suddenly evaporated.\u201d White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow echoed optimism from lawmakers Thursday while stating he sees things heading in a good direction.

During a press briefing Wednesday, Operation Chief Advisor Moncef Slaoui predicted at least 100 million Americans will be immune to the virus by the end of February. This came as about 20 million people are expected to be vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines during the month of December alone. Slaoui added 30 million people will be vaccinated by January and 50 million by February.  Vaccine front-runners \u2018Pfizer\u2019 and \u2018Moderna\u2019 have both sent their vaccines to the FDA for Emergency Use Approval. Each of the two has proven its high effectiveness at about 95 percent. Once approved, the Warp Speed team can begin shipping doses within two days of authorization. Chief Operations Officer Gen. Gus Perna said they will release doses as they become available. \u201cWe are not waiting for a cluster of vaccines to be available and then push,\u201d Perna stated. \u201cWe want a rhythmic, cadenced delivery of vaccine so the states can best manage it to the priorities as they developed it.\u201d State officials will determine who should receive the vaccine first. Advocacy groups have called for health care workers and the elderly to be considered. Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear if \u2018Pfizer\u2019 and \u2018Moderna\u2019 vaccines will be available after February. However, officials said other companies like \u2018Johnson and Johnson\u2019 and \u2018AstraZeneca\u2019 are also in the running to produce coronavirus vaccines. They could get approval at the beginning of next year.",
