    "article_text": "The Suburbs Helped Elect Biden. Can They Give Democrats the Senate, Too? DECATUR, Ga. \u2014 President Trump bet his re-election on a very specific vision of the American suburb: a 2020 edition of Mayfield from \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d in which residents are white, resent minorities, and prioritize their economic well-being over all other concerns. The bet fell far short. Mr. Trump lost ground with suburban voters across the country. And particularly in Georgia, where rapidly changing demographics have made it the most racially diverse political battleground in the country, his pitch has been at odds with reality. From the inner suburbs surrounding Atlanta and extending to the traditionally conservative exurbs, Democrats benefited from two big changes: Black, Latino and Asian residents moving into formerly white communities and an increase in the number of white, college-educated moderates and conservatives who have soured on Mr. Trump. Those factors helped President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. become the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992. And Senate runoff elections in January will test whether those Biden voters backed his agenda or simply sought to remove a uniquely divisive incumbent. Though Mr. Trump is not on the ballot next month, he is very much involved in the race, and has not moderated his message despite his chastening at the ballot box. The hope is, to some degree, that the pitch that fell short with suburban voters last month will work when Democratic control of the Senate is at stake. \u201cVery simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd at a rally on Saturday in Valdosta, Ga. \u201cAnd I will tell you this, socialist is just the beginning for these people. These people want to go further than socialism. They want to go into a communistic form of government.\u201d Mr. Trump was campaigning on behalf of Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who each have distinct political brands that could pose a challenge for Democrats. It\u2019s a challenge Democrats are seeking to overcome, especially among suburban voters, by keeping Mr. Trump front and center. Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate who finished about two percentage points behind Mr. Perdue, which sent their race to a runoff, makes this case at almost every campaign stop: If the Senate stays in Republican hands, it will block the change Georgia voted for when it elected Mr. Biden. Carolyn Bourdeaux is the only Democrat to flip a House district this year. She won in Atlanta\u2019s northeast suburbs and, like Mr. Biden, embraced her background as an ideological moderate and bipartisan deal maker. \u201cThe Biden effect was probably split ticket voters,\" she said.  Runoffs, she said, are about turnout, not party-crossing voters throwing a president out. \u201cYou get your people to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cSo one of the things you need to have is a real, robust grass-roots field operation.\u201d Ms. Bourdeaux\u2019s win \u2014 and Mr. Biden\u2019s \u2014 cracked a code for Democrats in the South, and highlights the changing nature of Atlanta\u2019s suburban electorate, which has helped the party succeed. It was an effort ignited by neighborhood-level organizers, accelerated by an unpopular president, and carried over the finish line because of changes in Atlanta\u2019s inner suburbs and throughout the state\u2019s smaller cities, which showed significant swings toward Mr. Biden. In Atlanta, long known colloquially as the \u201cBlack Mecca\u201d for its concentration of Black wealth and political power, the proportion of white residents has steadily grown. In the suburbs, Black residents who have moved outward and a diverse collection of new arrivals have fueled Democratic change. That includes a growing Latino population, an influx of Asian-Americans, and college-educated white voters who may have supported Mr. Trump in 2016 but turned against him. The result is a swing state where the \u201ctypical\u201d suburban voter can take many forms. There\u2019s Kim Hall, a 56-year-old woman who moved to suburban Cobb County eight years ago from Texas and attended a rally for Mr. Ossoff in Kennesaw. And Ali Hossain, a 63-year-old doctor who brags about his kids and cares about the economy; he attended an event for Mr. Ossoff in Decatur. He\u2019s also an immigrant from Bangladesh who has begun organizing for state and national candidates. \u201cAsian and South Asian \u2014 we\u2019re becoming big here,\u201d Mr. Hossain said. \u201cThis time was history. When I went to early vote I saw thousands of people in line. People were fed up with Trump.\u201d In Henry County, about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta, Mr. Biden improved on his party\u2019s performance in 2016 by nearly five times. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton bested Mr. Trump by four percentage points. In 2020, Mr. Biden won by more than 20 points. Michael Burns, chair of the Henry County Democratic Party, said he expected some drop off in interest from general election to runoff. Instead, he\u2019s been overwhelmed with investment from national groups and more local organizers than he knows what to do with. For the runoff, \u201cwe\u2019ve had to turn volunteers away,\u201d Mr. Burns said.  This is part of a larger shift, said Robert Silverstein, a Democratic political strategist who has worked on several Georgia races. Some assume suburban voters are universally moderate and white, not members of the party\u2019s diverse base or progressives. Mr. Silverstein said for Democrats to win the runoffs in January and keep winning in places like Georgia, they have to both energize and persuade. He noted that in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried the state, more affluent suburbs in Atlanta were \u201cblood red.\u201d Today, he said, the coalitions are vastly different. Still, the patchwork that made the 2020 Democratic coalition possible is nascent and fragile, and could be defeated by an energized Republican electorate. Both Democratic Senate candidates will have to improve on their showings in November, when the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock beat a split Republican field and Mr. Ossoff ran firmly behind Mr. Biden. Republicans are confident their base will turn out, and that the prospect of the unified Democratic government under Mr. Biden would put off some conservatives fearful of fiscal and cultural change. The location of their campaign events are a tell of their priorities: Republicans have largely steered clear of the Atlanta metro region to focus on increasing turnout in more rural portions of the state. On Saturday, both candidates rallied with President Trump in Valdosta. The city, which is near Florida and has a large military and Naval community, is geographically three hours from Atlanta but even further in terms of pace and culture. Democrats are hoping Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement leads to a backlash that helps them consolidate the suburban vote. Last week, in a steady stream of public events, Mr. Ossoff hammered the Republican response to the coronavirus pandemic to Asian-American voters in Decatur, a city in DeKalb County, near Atlanta. During an event near a local university in Cobb County, another changing suburban region, he called Mr. Perdue a coward for refusing to debate him and has been critical of Ms. Loeffler as well. \u201cWe\u2019re running against like the Bonnie and Clyde of political corruption in America,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. Some Georgia Republicans have privately expressed discomfort with Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue, who have hewed closely to Mr. Trump and all but abandoned outreach to the moderate center in favor of an all-base turnout strategy.  Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster in Georgia, said Republican erosion in the inner suburbs \u2014 and to a lesser degree the conservative exurbs \u2014 has blunted the advantage Republicans have enjoyed in runoff elections in the past. While white evangelicals and religious conservatives remain a core of the Republican base, and make up a portion of the suburban electorate, some Republicans worry such issue-driven voters may be put off by the Senators\u2019 willingness to dip into Trump-induced conspiracy theories and misinformation. Mr. Ayres said both sides have hurdles to overcome before January. Republicans have a president who is sowing discord within their party and Democrats need to mobilize communities that have typically sat out nonpresidential elections. They can\u2019t, he said, count on the same coalition that turned out in November. \u201cAre these now permanent Democratic voters? No, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in transition, and they were put off in large part by the conduct and behavior of the President.\u201d Both Democratic candidates, the state Democratic Party and outside groups have put together daily canvassing efforts to register and mobilize voters \u2014 again. Democrats have also taken notice of polling that shows Mr. Ossoff doing worse against Mr. Perdue than Dr. Warnock is faring against Ms. Loeffler. Few expect the drop off to be so significant that the parties will split the Senate seats in the end. Much more likely is two Democratic wins or two Republican ones, a contest determined by whether liberals can match an energized conservative electorate that has often been insurmountable in lower turnout runoff elections in the state. \u201cDefinitely demographics are changing. And the white folks, the higher educated voters in Fulton and Cobb counties, they became very anti-Trump very quickly,\u201d said Mr. Silverstein, the Democratic strategist. \u201cMy hope, as a Democrat operative, is that they remain that way. But that\u2019s the challenge here. There\u2019s still a lot of Republicans in these suburbs.\u201d Last week in Alpharetta, just north of Atlanta, a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d protest underscored the state\u2019s messy political landscape, and sent a mixed message to suburban voters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote on Jan. 5 on another machine made by China,\u201d said L. Lin Wood, the attorney who has become a conservative hero in recent weeks by echoing the president\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud. He challenged Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to be more vocal about overturning the election. At Mr. Ossoff\u2019s event in Kennesaw, several of his supporters found statements like Mr. Wood\u2019s worrying, and a sign that each part of their state \u2014 the cities, suburbs and rural areas \u2014 is changing in ways that show Georgians are further apart than ever. Tamekia Bell, a 39-year-old who moved back to the northwest suburb of Smyrna after years in the Washington area, said it\u2019s up to the voters who delivered for Mr. Biden in November to deliver again. \u201cThat hope we feel,\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cIt won\u2019t mean anything if Biden gets in there and can\u2019t do anything.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Decency Agenda Joe Biden won the presidency because, at a moment when so many Americans were exhausted by the chaos and nastiness of the Trump era, he promised stability, decency and healing. At the heart of his candidacy was the vow to be \u201ca president for all Americans\u201d as he labored \u201cto restore the soul of the nation.\u201d \u201cThe presidency itself is not a partisan institution,\u201d Mr. Biden stressed the day after the election. \u201cIt\u2019s the one office in this nation that represents everyone, and it demands a duty of care for all Americans. That is precisely what I will do.\u201d This is a soothing bit of uplift. But in a nation so starkly polarized, what does it even mean? While a record 81 million people voted for Mr. Biden, some 74 million voted to give President Trump four more years in office. Forget shared values: Americans cannot agree on a shared reality. Too many of us live in echo chambers, consuming information tailored to support our existing biases. Partisan warfare impels people to deny the legitimacy, even the humanity, of those with different viewpoints. What hope does any president have of bridging this gulf? Mr. Biden might consider a three-pronged approach. Call it the Decency Agenda. The first element is turning down the heat of the culture wars as they intersect with politics. Too often, proxy fights create more outrage than progress. The second part involves finding shared ground on policy that can push the country forward, even as it works to address its entrenched inequities and divisions. Could it at last be time for a serious \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d? The third element involves accountability. Not a truth commission mounted out of spite, or justice sought in the spirit of vengeance. But some way to get answers about what happened during the Trump administration, coupled with an attempt to restore some guardrails that proved insufficient to restrain Mr. Trump\u2019s worst impulses. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have more to say about parts two and three of such an agenda. It\u2019s too simplistic to say that the way to tamp down America\u2019s raging culture wars is for the incoming president to do the precise opposite of the departing one. But, in key respects, that prescription isn\u2019t far-off. This is not so much about policy, although putting together an agenda with broad appeal and bipartisan support will be a big part of Mr. Biden\u2019s challenge. This is about something more elemental \u2014 the president-elect\u2019s conception of leadership. Mr. Trump has approached the presidency, as he does everything, as a zero-sum proposition: To win, someone else must lose. Grounded in the politics of division, Trumpism is about attitude. The more antagonistic, the better. The president\u2019s re-election campaign wanted to \u201cmake liberals cry again.\u201d This kind of leadership poisons the body politic, a little more each day. Presidents are role models. Their words and comportment influence their supporters and, more generally, set the tone for the national discourse. Mr. Trump has not merely normalized cruelty and boorishness; he has given it the imprimatur of the Oval Office. One of Mr. Biden\u2019s most basic jobs will be to model a different leadership \u2014 to reclaim what it means to be presidential in a way that restores dignity and humanity to the office. Some of what this requires is straightforward: Don\u2019t demean political opponents or fellow world leaders. Don\u2019t insult members of your own administration. Don\u2019t accuse people who merely disagree with you of treason. Don\u2019t have a Twitter tantrum every time your feelings get bruised. Or, maybe, stay off Twitter altogether. More specifically, Mr. Biden will need to restore and reinforce some guardrails and norms that Mr. Trump tore down, in the recognition that not even presidents are above the law. He has already made his tax returns public, a welcome step back toward accountability. Going forward, he will need to make clear that key institutions \u2014 the Department of Justice, the intelligence community and the military, for starters \u2014 will be free from partisan meddling. His administration\u2019s inspectors general must be treated as guardians, not turncoats, and they may need to be granted additional protections. He will need to acknowledge that oversight of the executive branch is a legitimate function of Congress, not something to be dismissed out of hand. Speaking to the concerns of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, without condemnation or condescension, will be crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s unification efforts. It helps that the new president has an unpolished, regular-guy appeal and a knack for connecting on a personal level that keeps him from seeming like a snooty elitist. His Catholic faith is important to him, which will resonate in many enclaves. In pursuing his governing agenda, disagreements will arise over deeply held beliefs, and the arguments are bound to get heated. But, unlike his predecessor, Mr. Biden knows the difference between opponents and enemies. Mr. Trump has stoked cultural conflict \u2014 by, for instance, declaring war on N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem. Mr. Biden presumably will find better uses of his time and energy. Not every culture-war skirmish merits presidential involvement, and many would be better managed without it. QAnon may be a disturbing sign of the times, but it does not yet rise to the level of a presidential talking point. Neither do the \u201cthin blue line\u201d flags that are a sign of police solidarity and, depending on whom you ask, white supremacy. With the coronavirus holding center stage, even core culture-war issues \u2014 abortion, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, religious freedom, assault weapons \u2014 may wind up relegated to the political background. There will be movement on all of these issues outside of Mr. Biden\u2019s control, either in Congress or the courts. But he need not celebrate or mourn each of these developments as an existential victory or defeat. Not because they aren\u2019t important, but precisely because they incite such passion and fury. All of these questions will be contested long after Mr. Biden\u2019s term in office is over. These long-simmering challenges will still be there, waiting, when the acute trauma of the pandemic has passed and the nation begins its recovery. Mr. Biden has the temperament and the tools to moderate rather than maximize conflict. When the death of George Floyd this spring sparked nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality, forcing those issues to the forefront of the presidential race, Mr. Trump sought to inflame tensions. Who can forget his Twitter invocation of the civil rights-era phrase, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d? Mr. Biden took a different approach. He acknowledged America\u2019s entrenched racism and stressed his support for police reform, even as he rightfully rejected the edgier calls to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d He reached out to the victims of and the families impacted by police violence, offering comfort and understanding, and he sympathized with the frustration and anger of the protesters. But he also condemned the pockets of violent rioting that accompanied some protests. His goal was not to downplay the problem but to lower the temperature on a crisis that threatened to consume the nation. Nowhere has the bleed of culture wars into politics been deadlier than in what should have been a wholly apolitical matter: the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Historians will puzzle over the idea that mask-wearing in service of protecting all citizens was considered by many to be a mark of oppression. Imagine if supporters of free trade or the Green New Deal decided to shun wearing seatbelts, as a political statement. The pandemic is a public health emergency requiring precautions and sacrifices. Yet Americans are also weary of those sacrifices and depressed and frustrated by having their lives turned upside down. As president, Mr. Biden can express empathy with such exhaustion, while standing firm on the necessity of ongoing safety measures. He can continue to model good behavior, like mask-wearing and social distancing. He can decline to host potential super-spreader events in the Rose Garden. Other members of his administration can be directed to follow suit. A national mask mandate might not be feasible at this point, but calling on government workers to observe basic safety precautions is well within the president\u2019s authority. If Americans see their leaders working to keep the public safe, they may be more willing to do their part. If, as seems likely, the new president inherits a divided government, some of the more ambitious items on many of his supporters\u2019 wish lists will have to be set aside for now. As a candidate, Mr. Biden won plaudits for his listening skills and for his outreach to former rivals. Once in office, he\u2019ll need to keep the lines of communication wide open and ensure that his restive base does not feel taken for granted. Pretty much every move Mr. Biden makes will disappoint some constituency. Such is the nature of the presidency. His persistent challenge will be to deal with all parties respectfully, bringing people into the conversation and making them feel heard. Even when his outreach efforts fail, they will send a message about how he views his job. \u201cLet\u2019s give each other a chance,\u201d Mr. Biden pleaded in his Nov. 7 victory speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not enemies. They are Americans.\u201d America\u2019s divisions predate Mr. Trump, and they will outlast Mr. Biden. But there is progress to be made. And there is value in the very act of trying.

    "article_text": "Biden Picks Xavier Becerra to Lead Health and Human Services WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has selected Xavier Becerra, the Democratic attorney general of California, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, tapping a former congressman who would be the first Latino to run the department as it battles the surging coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Becerra became Mr. Biden\u2019s clear choice only over the past few days, according to people familiar with the transition\u2019s deliberations, and was a surprise. Mr. Becerra has carved out a profile on the issues of criminal justice and immigration, and he was long thought to be a candidate for attorney general. But as attorney general in California, he has been at the forefront of legal efforts on health care, leading 20 states and the District of Columbia in a campaign to protect the Affordable Care Act from being dismantled by his Republican counterparts. He has also been vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women\u2019s health. If confirmed, Mr. Becerra will immediately face a daunting task in leading the department at a critical moment during a pandemic that has killed more than 281,000 people in the United States \u2014 and one that has taken a particularly devastating toll on people of color. \u201cThe A.C.A. has been life-changing and now through this pandemic, we can all see the value in having greater access to quality health care at affordable prices,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in June, when he filed a brief with the Supreme Court in defense of the health care law. \u201cNow is not the time to rip away our best tool to address very real and very deadly health disparities in our communities.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team declined to comment. The president-elect plans to formally announce Mr. Becerra as his choice to lead the health department early this week, along with several other top health care advisers, according to people familiar with the rollout. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, will be selected to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a person familiar with Mr. Biden\u2019s deliberations. Dr. Walensky, whose selection was reported earlier by Politico, will replace Dr. Robert R. Redfield as the leader of the scientific agency at the forefront of the nation\u2019s pandemic response. Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general under President Barack Obama, will reprise that role for Mr. Biden. A telegenic confidant of the president-elect, Mr. Murthy will become one of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers on medical issues and will lead much of the public outreach on the pandemic. Jeffrey D. Zients, an entrepreneur and management consultant who served as the head of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council and fixed the bungled rollout of the health law\u2019s online insurance marketplace, will become a coronavirus czar in the White House, leading efforts to coordinate the fight against the coronavirus pandemic among the government\u2019s sprawling agencies. Some medical experts, who have been pushing the Biden team to name people with medical or public health expertise to serve in health leadership positions, were caught off guard \u2014 and unhappily so \u2014 by the news of Mr. Becerra\u2019s selection. In a letter sent last week to Mr. Biden, five leading medical groups \u2014 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians among them \u2014 called on the president-elect to appoint \u201cqualified physicians to serve in key positions critical to advancing the health of our nation.\u201d One person familiar with that effort said people involved were \u201castounded\u201d by the selection of Mr. Becerra, and suggested that Mr. Biden elevate Dr. Murthy to a cabinet-level position. But in an interview on Sunday night, Dr. Ada D. Stewart, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, one of the groups that sent the letter, described Mr. Becerra as \u201ca good choice\u201d and \u201can experienced legislator and executive\u201d \u2014 even as she conceded that her group would \u201cprefer, of course, to have a physician in this position.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen his commitment to health and equity, and those things can\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d she said. Mr. Becerra\u2019s experience in Washington may also help Mr. Biden secure legislative changes to bolster the Affordable Care Act, a central promise that the president-elect made during the 2020 campaign. Mr. Becerra, 62, served 12 terms in Congress, representing Los Angeles, before becoming the attorney general of his home state in 2017. He is the first Latino to hold that office, and while in Congress he was the first Latino to serve as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, where he worked on health care as a senior member of the health subcommittee. He also led the House Democratic Caucus, which gave him a powerful leadership post. An outspoken advocate of improved health care access, Mr. Becerra said in 2017 that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support Medicare for all, a proposal for government-run health care that Mr. Biden has explicitly rejected. A source familiar with the selection said Mr. Becerra would support the president-elect\u2019s call for strengthening and preserving the A.C.A. and would not be pushing Medicare for all while in office. As California\u2019s top law enforcement official, Mr. Becerra helped lead legal fights across the nation for access to health care, focusing in particular on dismantling barriers for women struggling to get medical services. In April, Mr. Becerra led a coalition of 22 state attorneys general in challenging a Mississippi law that prohibited doctors from providing abortion services past 15 weeks. In a statement at the time, Mr. Becerra called the ban \u201cunjust, unlawful, and unfair.\u201d \u201cLaws like Mississippi\u2019s are a systematic attempt to undo a woman\u2019s constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to stand up for safe access to reproductive care and defend these rights for all women.\u201d Mr. Becerra\u2019s office boasted frequently of the many lawsuits he had filed against the Trump administration, including suits challenging the president\u2019s immigration and environmental policies. His activism in fighting the Trump agenda in court earned him praise from leading progressives in the Democratic Party. In September, Mr. Becerra said the tally of his anti-Trump lawsuits had grown to 100. But Mr. Becerra also partnered with Republican counterparts at times, joining a bipartisan group of attorneys general in August to urge the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to increase access to remdesivir, a drug that has shown promise in treating Covid-19. He also worked with Republicans to prevent student vaping. Born in Sacramento, Mr. Becerra grew up in a working-class family; his mother emigrated from Mexico, and he was the first in his family to graduate from college. He attended Stanford as an undergraduate and received his law degree there in 1984. Mr. Biden was impressed by Mr. Becerra\u2019s personal story, according to a person familiar with his thinking. In particular, the president-elect liked the fact that Mr. Becerra served clients with mental health needs shortly after graduating from law school, the person said. While in Congress, Mr. Becerra was a fierce advocate of the Latino community and became deeply involved in efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system. He also promoted plans to build a national museum devoted to exploring the culture and history of American Latinos. The House voted this year to create such a museum. Representative Filemon Vela, Democrat of Texas, praised Mr. Biden\u2019s choice of Mr. Becerra, calling it \u201chistoric\u201d and saying the California attorney general was the right person to lead the sprawling agency during the worst public health crisis in 100 years. \u201cBecerra will lead an agency that will play a crucial role in overseeing a massive immunization effort and help manage a bolstered federal response to tackle the worsening Covid-19 crisis,\u201d Mr. Vela said. \u201cHe will also help shape the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to build on the Affordable Care Act.\u201d In the late 1990s, Mr. Becerra traveled to Cuba and visited with its leader, Fidel Castro, which infuriated Republican members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. They resigned, saying they were \u201cpersonally insulted\u201d by the visit. Mr. Biden\u2019s selection of Mr. Becerra to replace the current secretary, Alex M. Azar II, comes as the president-elect is under increasing pressure from the Latino community and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to diversify his cabinet. Mr. Becerra is the second Latino Mr. Biden has chosen for his cabinet after the selection last month of Alejandro N. Mayorkas, a Cuban immigrant, as secretary of homeland security. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico had been thought to be in line for the health secretary\u2019s job, but she apparently fell out of the running. Instead, news leaked last week that Ms. Lujan Grisham had been offered, and turned down, the position of interior secretary. The leak prompted Senator-elect Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico to use a private meeting with top Biden advisers to rebuke the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior Biden officials for their treatment of Ms. Lujan Grisham, according to a Democrat familiar with the discussion. If approved, Mr. Becerra\u2019s nomination would create yet another statewide office in California to be filled by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was already considering candidates, including Mr. Becerra, for the Senate seat being vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Mr. Becerra has been California\u2019s attorney general since 2017, when Ms. Harris was elected to the Senate and Gov. Jerry Brown appointed him to fill her seat. His term would expire in 2022.

    "article_text": "After Centuries of Obscurity, Wilmington Is Having a Moment WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 The hometown of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has long wrestled with its image problem. Namely, it does not have one. If people could find Wilmington on a map \u2014 and many couldn\u2019t \u2014 they thought of it as a convenient pit stop along the Northeast Corridor, which was dominated by far larger, more important, more colorful places. It is a city lacking a well-known culinary dish, historical event, professional sports team or even a particular catchphrase.  And yet, against dubious odds not unlike those that Mr. Biden overcame in reaching the presidency after three tries, Wilmington appears determined to ride the Biden wave to long-elusive glory. \u201cUsually, nobody pays attention to us, and now we are on the news every night!\u201d exclaimed Karen Kegelman of the Delaware Historical Society, whose first memorable encounter with Mr. Biden dates back to when he spoke at her high school graduation. She is 53. The president-elect has transformed the city into a federal-government-in-waiting. He delivers speeches and television interviews from the Queen, a restored theater downtown. His motorcade, 20 vehicles long, regularly brings traffic to a screeching halt, and gawking drivers appear delighted. Cabinet nominees swan through the opulent lobby of the Hotel Du Pont. Suddenly, all of Wilmington is bathing in the dizzying warmth of an unexpected spotlight. \u201cIt creates a little mystique about the city,\u201d Mayor Michael S. Purzycki said. \u201cIt creates great curiosity about the city \u2014 people coming by all the time wanting to know what is going on, tell me about your city.\u201d Mr. Purzycki harbors no illusions regarding the colorless reputation of his town: \u201cWilmington has always been on I-95 between Washington, Philly and New York, you know.\u201d He compared its famously dull, corporate vibe to the unvarying \u201cMad Men\u201d uniform worn by the legions of lawyers and chemical engineers who once populated its downtown: \u201ca white shirt, a sincere tie and 12-pound wingtips.\u201d \u201cIt was not a creative culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty predictable, stay within the guard rails.\u201d The main mystery about the place seems to be identifying something, anything, that distinctly says \u201cWilmington.\u201d Ask residents to name a unique feature and the universal response is a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s intimate,\u201d some will eventually say. That\u2019s a euphemism for small. The population hit a high mark of almost 90,000 circa 1940 and is now at around 72,000. Others will point you to the Court of Chancery. It is not quite the Statue of Liberty or the Grand Canyon, but it is a singular institution in the United States. Corporate titans use the specialized court to wage legal Armageddon to control stock shares, but companies must be registered in Delaware to present a case. Nearly 1.5 million are, including household names like Coca-Cola and Geico. When Walt Disney Co. shareholders balked at the $140 million severance package paid mostly in stock options to Michael Ovitz in 1996 after he was dismissed as president of the company, for example, they tried to claw them back in chancery court and lost. The court has been around since 1792, but try finding it. There is not even a sign for it outside the 12-story, steel and glass tower on North King Street that it shares with other courts. The low profile belies the riches it generates. Last year, taxes and fees for corporate registrations amounted to $1.45 billion, roughly 30 percent of the state\u2019s operating budget, said Jonathan Starkey, spokesman for Gov. John Carney. There is a dark side, too. Secrecy laws allow foreign kleptocrats and other nefarious types to stash ill-gotten gains anonymously, though reform efforts are underway. Weighty matters, but not the stuff of tourist stampedes. People thinking of tax or financial havens tend to picture Monaco or Panama, while Wilmington lacks either super yachts or a signature hat. Still, residents point to places like the booming Riverfront neighborhood, reclaimed from industrial wasteland, as well as new restaurants and galleries downtown to indicate that Wilmington is trying to change. \u201cI wanted to bring some light and energy to Wilmington,\u201d said Nataki Oliver, who opened a small gallery called The Sold Firm to feature Black artists and to offer painting classes for children. Aside from corporations, two of the three \u201cCs\u201d that constitute the city\u2019s holy trinity \u2014 credit cards and chemicals \u2014 have faded somewhat. Credit card companies rushed in, starting in the 1980s, after Delaware removed all caps on interest rates, as long as the firms based their operations locally. The volume of credit card bills means they have their own ZIP code, but mergers have diminished the number of institutions. The third C is chemicals. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, usually known as DuPont, began in 1802 by manufacturing gunpowder. DuPont and its fabulously wealthy owners dominated Wilmington for the next 200 years, creating products like nylon, Teflon and Kevlar. Its 2017 merger with Dow Chemical Company largely ended that reign, even if the family and the company left traces everywhere. There is a duPont hospital, a du Pont high school, a Dupont street and a DuPont country club. The main area attractions include three former du Pont estates. (There are nearly as many spellings as there are du Pont institutions.)  Mr. Biden announced that he would appoint a climate change \u201cczar\u201d in a speech delivered at the Delaware Museum of Natural History. It, too, was founded by a du Pont heir, an expert ornithologist who collected 66,000 birds and two million seashells. The founder does not get mentioned so much because in 1996 he shot dead an Olympic wrestling champion at a training camp that he had established on his estate. When the convicted murderer died in prison in 2010, he left the bulk of his estimated $200 million fortune to a Bulgarian wrestler. There are other intriguing bits of Wilmington lore. Swedes founded the city in 1638, and they managed to invent the log cabin before the Dutch ran them off after 17 years. Bob Marley worked in a car plant and as a janitor in the Hotel Du Pont in the early 1970s. Something grander or more famous always seems to overshadow hallmark Wilmington moments, however. Rodney Square, the heart of downtown Wilmington, was named after a founding father who rode overnight to Philadelphia to cast a deciding vote for the Declaration of Independence. Yet the midnight ride of that founding father, Caesar Rodney, never got the same press as Paul Revere\u2019s journey. (Wilmington also cannot decide when it happened. The plinth for the statue of the galloping Mr. Rodney bears two different dates: July 1-2, 1776, and July 3-4, 1776.) Mr. Rodney also owned slaves, and during the protests that erupted last summer after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, city officials whisked the statue off to New Jersey for safekeeping. There has long been a thorny relationship between Wilmington\u2019s mostly Black, impoverished center and its largely white, wealthy suburbs. Riots that erupted after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. devastated the downtown, and the nervous governor at the time set a nationwide record by deploying National Guard troops for nine months. The scattered pieces of Wilmington\u2019s past have never quite coalesced into a narrative whole, said David Walter, a freelance journalist who grew up here, missing \u201cwhatever that glue is.\u201d City officials make periodic stabs at creating the glue by rolling out new slogans. \u201cA Place to Be Somebody\u201d was around for years, replaced by \u201cWilmington, in the middle of it all.\u201d The latest is \u201cIt\u2019s Time,\u201d but that tends to provoke the question \u201cTime for what?\u201d and the mood is more \u201cIt\u2019s Biden.\u201d He is not exactly new. On the night that Mr. Biden won the presidency, people from Wilmington inundated their Facebook profiles with their Biden selfies. \u201cMy friends not from Delaware were like \u2018Oh my God! You met him?!\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Horney, who arrived two years ago to establish the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware. \u201cEverybody has met him.\u201d The inevitable flood tide of gimcrack Biden souvenirs has yet to start in earnest, but there are some. Scented candles named after Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris cost $22 apiece at a gift shop abutting the Queen theater. Hers smells like lotus blossoms, inspired by her name, whereas his exudes the aroma of one of his favorite beverages: orange Gatorade. Mr. Biden trails only the du Ponts in getting his moniker slapped on things. The Amtrak station was named for him because he commuted by train to the U.S. Senate from Wilmington starting in 1973. The pool where he worked as a teenager bears his name. The Biden Welcome Center is the highway rest stop located along the roughly 30 miles that Interstate 95 slices through Delaware, between Pennsylvania and Maryland. William A. Sullivan, the chairman of the Greater Wilmington Convention and Visitors Bureau, dreams of installing a selfie-friendly Biden statue there to help entice more tourists off the freeway. \u201cMaybe that will come next,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "At Rally for Georgia Senators, Trump Focuses on His Own Grievances VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 One month before a pair of Georgia runoffs that will determine the Senate majority, President Trump used a rally for the Republican senators on Saturday to complain about his own loss last month, insisting he would still prevail and, with notably less ardor, encouraging voters here to re-elect the two lawmakers. Taking the stage for his first rally as a lame duck president, Mr. Trump immediately, and falsely, claimed victory in the presidential race. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump lost this state by just under 12,000 votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the White House with 306 electoral votes. But the president has persisted in his baseless claims that the final outcome remains in doubt. \u201cThey cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we\u2019ll still win,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence but nonetheless prompting about 10,000 supporters gathered on the tarmac at a regional airport to chant, \u201cStop the Steal!\u201d Speaking for an hour and 40 minutes, the president did read a series of scripted lines about the two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and repeatedly urged his supporters in Georgia to vote next month, even mentioning the deadlines for the mail-in ballots he has so often scorned. Yet he embedded those dutiful remarks of support in a deep thicket of conspiracy-mongering about his defeat and even aired a lengthy montage of video of clips from the conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network, which also depicted a sinister plot of electoral theft. Before he arrived in Valdosta, the president made no attempt to disguise his central priority as it relates to Georgia: overturning his loss in the state. He began the day with a telephone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, ostensibly to offer his condolences to the governor about the death in a car accident of a young man who was close to Mr. Kemp\u2019s family. But in truth, Mr. Trump used the call to urge Mr. Kemp, a Republican, to call the state legislature into session so the G.O.P. majorities could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. He has also called on Mr. Kemp to order an audit of signatures on ballots. At the rally, Mr. Trump amplified the critique he had been making of Mr. Kemp much of the day on Twitter, all but demanding that the governor overturn the will of the voters for him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cStop it very easily.\u201d The crowd booed when he invoked Mr. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the two Georgia Republicans Mr. Trump has been demanding abet his effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. And they cheered when he turned to Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican and Trump loyalist, and suggested he challenge Mr. Kemp in a gubernatorial primary in 2022. The president called the January races \u201cthe most important congressional runoff probably in American history\u201d and lashed the Democratic nominees, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as \u201cfar-left liberals.\u201d But he didn\u2019t unspool the most biting attacks on them until about an hour into his remarks, and it was later still that he brought Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to the stage for brief remarks. Mr. Perdue was nearly drowned out by the audience, which showered him with a \u201cFight for Trump\u201d chant that only grew louder when the two candidates handed the microphone back to the president. The president\u2019s supporters will not tolerate anything less than total fealty toward him. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent lament about what he described as the \u201crigged\u201d election illustrated the quandary for Republicans. With Mr. Trump sowing distrust in Georgia\u2019s voting system, railing against the vote-counting machines the state used and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud, he\u2019s giving Republicans in the state reason to question both voting by mail and in-person voting. If that prompts even a modest number of Republicans to sit out the Senate runoffs, especially in rural areas where Mr. Trump\u2019s support is strongest, it could be enough to alter the electoral math in the evenly divided state and tip the races to the Democrats. The president repeatedly sought to encourage Georgians to participate in the runoffs in the same breaths in which he railed against his own loss, offering a jarring, two-speeches-in-one presentation. \u201cYou got to get out and vote,\u201d he said just moments after venting that Republicans were purportedly \u201cnot nearly as vicious\u201d as Democrats when it came to stealing elections. In Valdosta, 250 miles south of Atlanta, supporters of the president began arriving by noon for the evening rally. Many of them had crossed the nearby state line from Florida and thus could not vote in the Senate races. The music, the red-white-and-blue stagecraft and Mr. Trump\u2019s heavily anticipated arrival were all familiar. But he showed little joy, and much of his speech was dedicated to nursing his grievances and was often reminiscent of the rambling, misinformation-filled, 45-minute video he delivered from the White House earlier in the week. \u201cI got more votes than any sitting president in history,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president\u2019s willingness to campaign Saturday night in heavily conservative South Georgia \u2014 far from the Atlanta-area voters who rejected him last month \u2014 heartened Republican officials, who have been lobbying him to intervene in the runoffs in support of Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue. But aides worried, presciently, in the days leading to the appearance that he would go off script and attack Mr. Kemp, who has become the primary target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter vitriol. Hoping to pacify Mr. Trump after Saturday\u2019s phone call, Mr. Kemp noted on Twitter that he had already called for an audit of the signatures on mail ballots \u201cto restore confidence in our election process.\u201d But Mr. Kemp\u2019s office has also said the governor does not have the power to unilaterally order a signature audit. Mr. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night because of the death of the family friend. Before Mr. Trump landed in Valdosta, Republicans took pains to emphasize the task at hand: the January runoffs. A mammoth video screen directed attendees to \u201cRequest Your Absentee Ballot Right Now!\u201d and directed them to the website to do so. And Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue both addressed the audience well before Air Force One touched down on a mild late autumn night. During a speech by Ms. Loeffler, who addressed the crowd nearly two hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the \u201cStop the steal\u201d chant broke out in the audience \u2014 in the cadence of the familiar \u201cLock her up\u201d chants that were popular during Mr. Trump\u2019s first run. Ms. Loeffler sought to redirect the crowd\u2019s energy to the runoff elections and away from the president\u2019s attempts to subvert the election results. \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you vote, we will win. If you don\u2019t, we will lose America and what it\u2019s founded on.\u201d But as Elton John\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u201d blared in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, it was far from clear whom the crowd was more intent on directing its hostility toward \u2014 Democrats or the Georgia Republicans the president is scapegoating for his loss in the state. And outside the event, there were few indicators that the purpose of the rally was to elect Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators. Trump signs were ubiquitous, and the merchandisers outside were selling only Trump gear. The challenge for Republicans was evident in remarks from Mr. Perdue, who veered between encouraging the thousands in attendance to vote in the upcoming runoff and defending Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to advance his claims of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for this president until he gets every ballot counted correctly and every illegal ballot thrown out,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. At the same time, he framed January\u2019s runoffs as a final chance for Republicans to issue a check against a Democratic administration. \u201cIf we win Georgia, we save America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks to you, we\u2019ll make sure the road to socialism never goes through the state of Georgia.\u201d Many in the audience had not accepted that Mr. Biden would be the next president. Jason Kresckey, who attended the rally with his wife, said he wanted to show support for the president. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that whole movement that he created was a movement that inspired a certain population of people. I just don\u2019t think that feeling is going anywhere soon.\u201d Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.",

But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus.

Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers. Two days later, a committee of outside experts will convene to make recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration about whether to grant emergency approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.

    "article_text": "Pelosi voices optimism on stimulus after McConnell agrees to compromise on a year-end spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi flashed fresh optimism on Friday that the House and Senate could soon reach a bipartisan deal on an elusive pandemic stimulus plan after she and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed to try to find an agreement that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package. \u201cThat would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said at a news conference in the Capitol Friday morning, a day after her conversation with Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. The phone call marked their first conversation since the election. Though Ms. Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be \u201csufficient time\u201d to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported on Friday as an added accelerant. \u201cThere is momentum. There is momentum,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed similar resolve on Thursday, although he stopped short of endorsing the $908 billion outline proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates that Ms. Pelosi has said should be the starting point for talks, instead pressing for a far smaller bill. Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like liability protections for businesses, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11, though most involved in the process say that a resolution is feasible before the end of the year. After months of insisting they would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Democrats now appear poised to accept less than one third of the spending they initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs, leaving other priorities unaddressed until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office Jan. 20. The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks, and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine. While a bipartisan group of senators is expected to continue working on finalizing legislative text through the weekend, there remain a number of significant hurdles. The policy divides that have helped derail attempts to reach agreement earlier this year persist even as lawmakers circulate a tentative outline. Pressed on her reversal, Ms. Pelosi was defensive on Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that the Senate called nonstarters were important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Mr. Biden\u2019s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to \u201ca total game-changer.\u201d \u201cPresident-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it, as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to saves lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Winds Have Shifted in Pandemic Aid Negotiations WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory and faster-than-expected breakthroughs on a coronavirus vaccine have shifted the dynamics of stimulus talks in Congress, leading to the first serious bipartisan negotiations in months and empowering rank-and-file lawmakers who have long agitated for a compromise. With many cities and states reinstating lockdowns and the pace of job creation slowing, congressional lawmakers and Mr. Biden are facing pressure to provide a financial lifeline to the economy until a widespread vaccine forces the virus into submission. Mr. Biden has used public appearances in recent days to encourage lawmakers to compromise on a quick aid package that he said would only be a \u201cdown payment\u201d on what the incoming administration believes is necessary to mitigate the nation\u2019s economic pain in the months ahead. His team has pushed for Democrats to move off their hard-line negotiating stance for a trillion-dollar-plus bill, a stance that had made discussions with Republicans a nonstarter, and to embrace a smaller, bipartisan proposal. \u201cI think it should be passed,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the $908 billion proposal in a CNN interview broadcast Thursday evening, though he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask for more help when we get there to get things done.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced such a shift on Wednesday, throwing their support behind a bipartisan $908 billion outline as a baseline for restarting negotiations. The plan, which rank-and-file lawmakers are still finalizing, would provide aid through March, offering a new wave of aid to small businesses and the unemployed, helping state and local governments and temporarily shielding businesses from some lawsuits amid the pandemic. In a sign of momentum, more Republicans also began coalescing around the $908 billion framework as a baseline for restarting negotiations, which had collapsed over disagreements about size and scope. On Thursday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, spoke for the first time since the November election about another relief package, along with the spending bills needed to avert a government shutdown on Dec. 11. Mr. McConnell later told reporters that he and Ms. Pelosi are \u201cboth interested in getting an outcome\u201d on the two issues. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more hopeful that we\u2019ll get a bill,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He told reporters that he supported the bipartisan framework and that he had discussed coronavirus relief with President Trump at the White House on Thursday. But he added a dose of skepticism, given Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to circulate a blueprint for a smaller relief package. \u201cI will support what Senator McConnell wants to propose,\u201d Mr. Graham said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have any Democratic support. I\u2019m tired of doing show votes here.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, along with Democrats on Capitol Hill, have become alarmed at the possibility that the economy could slip back into recession in the new year, as small businesses shutter and government benefits expire for millions of workers, handing him an even bigger economic challenge. But Mr. Biden is walking a delicate path in moving toward a possible compromise. He has called publicly for an immediate deal to provide more economic aid, even before he becomes president, and spoken favorably about the bipartisan framework. But he has not directly injected himself into talks between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell, as some lawmakers and aides stressed that any immediate deal would need Mr. Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 not Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cThe president-elect has been very clear in stating that something needs to happen, that the American people need relief,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia and one of several House lawmakers who have worked on compromise legislation in an effort to break through the impasse. When asked if Mr. Biden should be more involved, she said she believed it better for Mr. Biden to play a supporting role while Mr. Trump remained president. \u201cHe will not be president until Jan. 20 \u2014 we can\u2019t wait until Jan. 20,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. He\u2019s not yet the president.\u201d The question of whether Mr. Trump would support a final compromise remains a wild card. Asked Thursday whether he agreed with Mr. McConnell that pandemic relief was \u201cin sight\u201d and whether he would support \u201cthis bill,\u201d Mr. Trump answered affirmatively. \u201cI will, and I think we are getting very close,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. While it was initially unclear which bill Mr. Trump was willing to sign, the White House later clarified that it was the outline of the smaller Republican bill, which Mr. McConnell is backing. Unlike in the fall, when both Republicans and Democrats had political incentives not to cut a deal, statements by Mr. Biden and his congressional allies in recent days show that lawmakers now see compromise as in their best interests. Depending on the outcome, stimulus plans could become a key issue in the Georgia runoff elections that will decide Senate control in January. Even with the renewed movement, a deal is far from assured. Mr. McConnell, who has continuously criticized the Democrats as wanting too expensive a package, acknowledged that it had been \u201cheartening to see a few hopeful signs\u201d this week in negotiations. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of endorsing the compromise plan in remarks on Thursday, admonishing lawmakers to focus on policy provisions where there was substantial agreement and signaling that he would not be quick to move off his targeted proposal. Even as he declared \u201ccompromise is within reach,\u201d he did not explicitly comment on the bipartisan framework. It also remains unclear what top Democrats would insist on in any final bill. But lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill acknowledged that a devastating spike in coronavirus cases across the country helped fuel momentum behind the discussions. Even a smaller, more immediate deal would fund an imminent distribution of a vaccine \u2014 a prospect that emerged after the election \u2014 and leave open the possibility for another relief package under a Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of the logistical costs and difficulties of vaccine distribution and the dramatic spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths every day,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, a longtime close ally of Mr. Biden\u2019s who is involved in the discussions. \u201cIt is clear, to everyone I think, that we are in for a very hard winter before the vaccine is broadly available.\u201d Discussions toward a possible deal began among a loose bipartisan group of senators in mid-November, according to four officials familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks who requested anonymity to describe them. The participants agreed to meet over dinner at the Capitol Hill home of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Nov. 17, two weeks after Election Day, to see if they could cobble together a plan. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, picked up the tab for food and drinks from San Lorenzo, a favorite of Washington\u2019s political class for Tuscan food. Fresh off a come-from-behind victory in Maine, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, agreed to co-host. They were joined by three more Senate Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the party\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 as well as two more Senate Republicans, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah. The conversation was productive enough that it quickly spilled into a nearly daily series of Zoom sessions that continued \u2014 sometimes for hours at a time \u2014 through the Thanksgiving holiday. Pleased at their progress, senators involved dryly dubbed themselves \u201cthe dinner group.\u201d Party leadership was kept informed, but senators did most of the negotiating themselves. Despite his more junior Senate status, Mr. Romney, his party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emerged early on as a driver of the talks with Mr. Warner. He insisted that Republicans could go no higher than roughly $900 billion in new spending \u2014 a number that Ms. Collins floated as a possible compromise figure \u2014 and that liability protections for employers would have to be included in some form. The proposal was made final Monday night over a pizza dinner hosted by Mr. Romney in an oversize hearing room. It would provide $300 a week in additional benefits to the unemployed for 18 weeks, after a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapsed in July. It includes $288 billion for struggling small businesses, restaurants and theaters and $160 billion for strapped cities and states, and most likely will include some liability protections for businesses. The framework, unveiled Tuesday, quickly received a boost from Mr. Biden. And speaking Thursday on CNN, he noted that he had faith in Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Coons to resolve the impasse, adding that he was \u201crelying on their judgment\u201d in determining \u201cthe most basic things that are needed now.\u201d Luke Broadwater, Thomas Kaplan and Michael D.

    "article_text": "Trump has raised $207.5 million since Election Day combined with the Republican Party. Even in defeat, President Trump continued to raise money at some of the fastest rates of the year, pulling in $207.5 million in the month since Election Day with the Republican National Committee as he has stoked unfounded fears of election fraud and made baseless claims to undermine the legitimacy of the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus has continued to aggressively solicit donations under the guise of supporting his various legal challenges to the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., but as of now 75 percent of donations go to to a new political action committee that Mr. Trump formed in mid-November and 25 percent to the Republican Party. Only if a donor gives more than $6,000 do those funds go to Mr. Trump\u2019s formal \u201crecount\u201d account. His campaign did not release a breakdown of how the $207.5 million was divided, with funds split between the new PAC, paying off his campaign debts, the R.N.C. and two committees operated jointly by the party and the campaign. \u201cThese tremendous fund-raising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party,\u201d Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who has not formally conceded the 2020 race but has begun talking about running again in 2024, has repeatedly challenged the results in court with virtually no success. In his statement, Mr. Stepien added that the money \u201calso positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022.\u201d The Thursday announcement came on a final filing deadline of the 2020 race with the Federal Election Commission, which covers the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. During that period, the R.N.C., Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and their shared committees raised a combined $495 million, campaign officials announced. As of early evening, only the R.N.C. had filed its report, which showed it ended the period with $58.8 million cash on hand. As Mr. Trump has contested the results in multiple venues, the party had spent more than $6 million on legal bills, with $1.4 million going to the Jones Day law firm, $1.3 million to King and Spalding and more than $920,000 to Consovoy McCarthy.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fed Pick Squeaks Through Senate Confirmation WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Waller, nominated by President Trump to the Federal Reserve\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors, was confirmed by a narrow margin on Thursday as Republican senators scramble to fill open slots before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. assumes office. Mr. Waller, a regional Fed research official, had been up for Senate confirmation alongside Judy Shelton, whose long-held preference for some type of gold standard and apparent skepticism of Fed independence hurt her chances of confirmation. Mr. Waller made it through, but just barely, with a nearly party line vote of 48 to 47. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, joined Democrats in voting against Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller\u2019s selection means that Mr. Biden will take office with a Fed stocked with picks from Mr. Trump, who has now chosen five of the central bank\u2019s six sitting officials, including appointing Jerome H. Powell as its chair. The board will have one remaining open slot if Ms. Shelton is not confirmed. While the sitting governors have varying time left in their 14-year terms, Mr. Waller was appointed to an unexpired slot that stretches through early 2030. The White House announced that it would tap Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton in mid-2019, but their nominations \u2014 long treated as a pair \u2014 faced a roller-coaster confirmation process as senators grappled with misgivings over Ms. Shelton. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a Republican of Kentucky, tried but failed to bring her nomination to a vote in November. Her path to confirmation became even less likely given the changing makeup of the Senate. Senator Mark Kelly, the newly elected Democrat from Arizona, was sworn in this week, and his likely no vote could kill Ms. Shelton\u2019s razor-thin chance of passing, because she already faced opposition from several Republicans. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told reporters that Ms. Shelton\u2019s confirmation is \u201cunlikely\u201d after the changeover.

Jerome Powell was appointed as a governor by President Obama and subsequently appointed as chair by President Trump. Randal K. Quarles served as an acting governor for several months in 2018 pending his renomination. By Eleanor Lutz Though he was a conventional pick for the job, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation passed by the narrowest margin of any governor going back to at least 1980 and probably ever, based on data collected by a George Washington University professor, Sarah Binder. The partisan rancor shows how the process of appointing Fed governors \u2014 once drama free \u2014 has changed over the past decade. Both Mr. Trump and former President Barack Obama struggled to get nominees on the Fed board as political fights have erupted over who should fill seats on the powerful body, which plays a central role in setting interest rates and in shaping financial regulation. It also underlines the unusual path Mr. McConnell took in trying to push Fed officials through confirmation so late in the game. Mr. Waller is the first nominee ever confirmed during a lame-duck session, the period after an election but before a new administration enters the White House, according to the Fed historian Peter Conti-Brown. \u201cEverything has become hyper-politicized, and the Fed is no exception,\u201d said Mark Spindel, who with Ms. Binder wrote a book on politics at and around the Fed. \u201cFilling those spots with Trump appointees just limits what Biden can do.\u201d The Fed\u2019s Washington-based board members hold constant votes on monetary policy, while most of the 12 regional bank presidents rotate in and out of four voting seats. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the exception, holding a permanent vote. The board members, called governors, also vote on the regulations that govern the nation\u2019s largest banks. Interest-rate setting is usually not a partisan exercise, and policy preferences do not split cleanly along ideological lines. But bank oversight tends to be more political, with Republicans favoring lighter oversight and Democrats pushing for more stringent rules. Despite the drama, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation was received as good news by many in the central banking community. He is a seasoned economist who has worked in academia and, most recently, as research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Mr. Waller\u2019s research has covered topics including central bank independence \u2014 \u201cthe key tool to ensure a government will not misuse monetary policy\u201d \u2014 and he has laid out a rationale for keeping borrowing costs cheap when prices are increasing slowly, as they have been in recent years. The Fed raises or lowers interest rates to slow or speed up the economy, hoping to keep inflation slow and stable while maximizing employment. Before joining the Fed in 2009, Mr. Waller was a professor in the economics department at Notre Dame. He has a doctorate from Washington State University. It is not clear whether he will be installed at the Fed in time for the central bank\u2019s Dec. 15-16 meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s been an excellent research director,\u201d Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said of Mr. Waller, calling him an \u201cexcellent economist\u201d with a \u201ckeen mind.\u201d",

    "article_text": "President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.: They Dare Not Speak His Name WASHINGTON \u2014 Funny what passes for a jolting revelation at the Capitol these days. Senator Mitch McConnell had just uttered a sentence that in more normal times would be received \u2014 and quickly forgotten \u2014 as just the kind of drab boilerplate that the Senate majority leader, a Kentucky Republican, is known for. \u201cI think we all know that after the first of the year, there\u2019s likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday as he discussed prospects for a coronavirus relief bill. At which point he delivered his bombshell: \u201cDepending on what the new administration wants to pursue.\u201d Aha! He said \u201cnew administration.\u201d Implying there would be an outgoing president. If President Trump had won re-election, as he keeps insisting \u2014 and which few Republican senators will publicly disabuse him of \u2014 there would be no \u201cnew administration\u201d to speak of. In other words, Mr. McConnell, in his own circuitous and perhaps unintentional way, was acknowledging that Mr. Trump had lost. Maybe he did not mean to be so forthcoming. It is, after all, a delicate verbal dance that Mr. McConnell and many of his fellow Republican senators are engaged in. They do not wish to alienate the apparently significant portion of the party\u2019s base that still believes that Mr. Trump won, or antagonize the president to the point that he torments them with future grudges, tweets and primary challengers from what will become the next de facto Republican home office, Mar-a-Lago. As such, when Mr. McConnell was asked directly about Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims, he reverted to his bland, inscrutable form. \u201cThe future will take care of itself,\u201d he said. This would seem beyond dispute. Privately, pretty much all Republican senators acknowledge that yes, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20. This includes even Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who admitted as much to Mark Becker, a former Republican official in the state. Mr. Becker recounted a conversation he had had with Mr. Johnson on Wednesday in The Bulwark, a website with a heavy bent toward \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatism. When Mr. Becker asked Mr. Johnson why he had never acknowledged this election result in public, Mr. Johnson explained that to do so would be \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d (It appears likely that Mr. Johnson believed this conversation was private.) In recent weeks, the unwillingness of most Senate and House Republicans to acknowledge an obvious election result has reached new levels of absurd. Whenever another prominent Republican official admits that Mr. Biden in fact won, the media updates the scoreboard like it\u2019s breaking news \u2014 as if a new state had been called on election night. Senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins declared this early, as did former President George W. Bush, his brother Jeb Bush, and a bunch of Republican governors and members of Congress. To reiterate what should now be indisputable: Mr. Biden won the election. Every serious news outlet in the United States has declared it. Nearly every lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has filed disputing results in multiple states has failed \u2014 laughably in many cases. and Attorney General William P. Barr announced Tuesday that he had seen zero proof of fraud that would meaningfully affect the outcome. (Mr. Trump is reportedly furious at Mr. Barr for saying this.) Mr. Biden has received nearly seven million more votes than Mr. Trump, and he has amassed an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, with virtually all ballots counted. It appeared last Sunday that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, had joined the ranks of the sky-is-blue caucus when he referred to the \u201cBiden administration\u201d in an interview with CNN. This was of added significance because Mr. Blunt is the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees inaugural activities. \u201cWe are working with the Biden administration,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cLikely administration,\u201d he corrected himself. Ms. Bash pressed Mr. Blunt on whether this meant Mr. Biden was in fact the \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Not so fast, he said. \u201cWell, the president-elect will be the president-elect when the electors vote for him,\u201d Mr. Blunt said, referring to the meeting of the Electoral College that is scheduled for Dec. 14. \u201cThere is no official job of president-elect,\u201d Mr. Blunt explained, though this had not stopped him from congratulating \u201cPresident-elect\u201d Donald J. Trump in a statement the day after Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. In lieu of explicitly saying that Mr. Biden won, most Republicans are at least willing to engage in public discourse predicated on that reality. They have, for instance, repeatedly said that the two Senate seats up for grabs in a Georgia runoff election next month would determine which party controlled the chamber. If both Republican incumbents, Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, lose, the Senate would be 50-50, and Democrats would win the majority \u2014 an assumption premised on Senator Kamala Harris becoming the vice president and presiding over the Senate and being tasked with breaking tied votes. Several have weighed in on Mr. Biden\u2019s cabinet nominees. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, deemed the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, \u201cradioactive.\u201d Mr. Cornyn also lamented that Mr. Biden\u2019s team had not sought \u201cconsultation\u201d from Republicans before making the choice (which would of course not be necessary if Mr. Biden had lost and was just spitballing). Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to suggest a few good candidates to be the next secretary of agriculture \u201cif Biden becomes pres.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence even made the trip to Capitol Hill to swear in the newly elected Democratic senator from Arizona, Mark Kelly, while Mr. Pence\u2019s boss continued to rail against the results in that state (which were formally certified Monday). When asked after Mr. Kelly\u2019s swearing-in whether this meant he accepted the election results, Mr. Pence did not respond to reporters. Things get trickier when Republicans are asked directly whether they accept the results of the election, as reporters have been pressing them to do pretty much daily since Nov. 3. In normal times (how long before we retire that qualifier?), this question would yield some variation on the same obvious and broadly accepted response: \u201cYes.\u201d Alas, these are not normal times. \u201cThis has not been a conventional presidency,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, summarized for reporters when he was asked why he and other Republicans have not raised concerns about the president\u2019s repeated and false claims that the election was \u201crigged\u201d or \u201cstolen.\u201d Since Mr. Trump was sworn in, Republicans have repeatedly sought verbal refuge in the \u201cunconventional\u201d nature of this presidency. This has been something of a blanket response to questions about his latest incendiary conduct. From Day 1, these statements have involved a willingness to indulge \u201calternative facts,\u201d as Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said in defense of the untrue assertion by Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period.\u201d In other words, an administration that began with a whopping assertion of \u201calternative facts\u201d is concluding with similarly outlandish claims about an alternative election result.

    "article_text": "Georgia Was a Big Win for Democrats. Black Women Did the Groundwork. RIVERDALE, Ga. \u2014 Decades before Joseph R. Biden Jr. flipped Georgia for the Democrats, Felicia Davis was a one-stop political organizing dynamo in Clayton County, canvassing for issues rather than candidates, for her community rather than a political party. The boom of her voice and the clarity of her convictions command respect. In her operation, even the teenagers are paid $15 an hour to knock on doors and distribute literature. Almost everyone is diligent: She is not someone to disappoint. \u201cI am unapologetically Black,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cMy agenda is Black. My community is Black. My county is Black. So what I do is Black. And for 20 years, we\u2019ve been trying to tell people what was possible.\u201d When Georgia turned blue for Mr. Biden this year after record voter turnout, it validated the political vision and advocacy of a group of Black women who have led a decades-long organizing effort to transform the state\u2019s electorate. Democrats celebrated their work registering new voters, canvassing and engaging in long-term political outreach. The achievement seemed to confirm mantras that have become commonplace in liberal politics, like \u201ctrust Black women\u201d and \u201cBlack women are the backbone of the Democratic Party.\u201d But the same women tell a more complicated story about their relationship with elected Democrats, national campaign officials and prominent political groups. For years, they said, their political vision was demeaned and distrusted. Donors and campaigns balked at the idea that Georgia was a battleground state worth investing in and that the organizers had picked up on demographic and political changes in their home state that others had missed. Now, with Georgia at the center of the political universe ahead of two pivotal Senate runoff elections in January, the organizers are asking Democrats: Will you embrace our approach now? \u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised that Georgia turned blue, because we\u2019ve been working on it for over 15 years,\u201d said Deborah Scott, the founder of Georgia Stand Up. When she started the group in 2004, she said, it was hard to persuade philanthropy groups and political foundations that focus on grass-roots organizing to consider Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cBecause here, we\u2019re not just women, we\u2019re Southern women. And we\u2019re not just Southern women, we\u2019re Southern Black women.\u201d The most famous member of the club is Stacey Abrams, the former state lawmaker and candidate for governor who founded a voter registration group called the New Georgia Project. But there are many others \u2014 like Ms. Davis and Helen Butler, who was mentored by the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, the late civil rights leader \u2014 who have spent years working to turn out voters in Georgia. No single group delivered the state to Mr. Biden or can take credit for turnout there. In a presidential race decided by a razor-thin margin in Georgia, every piece mattered: increased turnout among young voters; outreach to Black, Latino and Asian-American communities; and a rejection of President Trump by some college-educated white voters who typically vote Republican. In the organizers\u2019 telling, the story of how Georgia voted does not start with Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 or Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign investment this year. It begins a decade earlier, when a new generation of Black female leaders decided to create their own structures, fed up with a state party dominated by conservative \u201cDixiecrats\u201d and a moderate establishment that presumed the electorate could not change. They would identify, engage and turn out communities that had been traditionally overlooked \u2014 just as they had been themselves. It was a slow build that included close losses in the 2016 presidential election, the 2017 House special election in Georgia and Ms. Abrams\u2019s run in 2018. Ms. Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, said her group\u2019s political work showed how \u201cBlack women take care of the entire community, not just themselves.\u201d Nse Ufot, who leads the New Georgia Project, said the same national leaders now praising voter registration efforts in Georgia should reflect on how long it had taken them and groups like the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to invest in the Black women leading the push. \u201cNational campaign committees and presidential campaigns, like the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C., would have their favorite pastor or their favorite community activists just run programs,\u201d she said. \u201cNo accountability. No data.\u201d Ms. Ufot added: \u201cIt was just their favorite pastor dude saying, \u2018Turn your people out.\u2019 When people like Helen Butler could actually run a proper program.\u201d \u201cFoundations were not supporting social justice and community building work here,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one was looking at what\u2019s happening in our rural areas, and no one\u2019s looking at the small ways that people were being cheated out of their own democracy by having these voter suppression laws. People weren\u2019t even paying attention, because they thought that\u2019s just the way it was here.\u201d For years, national Democratic campaigns have wrestled with whether Georgia and other Southern states were worthy investments, including during former President Barack Obama\u2019s race in 2012 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. However, in the zero-sum environment of presidential politics, Democrats prioritized other states, including in the Upper Midwest and traditional battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida.  Asked about the criticism from Ms. Ufot and others, representatives for the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C. declined to respond directly. A spokeswoman for the D.C.C.C. praised the organizing in Georgia and said that in recent years, the party had invested in local groups and campaign organizers with success. \u201cGeorgia doesn\u2019t turn blue without the determined organizing of activists and leaders in communities of color, particularly the Black community,\u201d said Robyn Patterson, the national press secretary for the D.C.C.C. \u201cHouse Democrats flipped two Trump-lean districts by investing early, hiring talented organizers with deep ties to their communities, and engaging the people of color who have spent years working to move Georgia forward.\u201d The arc of Georgia\u2019s transformation has become a road map for other states that are experiencing rapid demographic change and a catalyst for a new strategy in liberal politics. Versions of the New Georgia Project have popped up in Virginia, Texas and North Carolina as organizers try to create new, consistent voting blocs. This year, the progressive donor Susan Sandler gave $200 million to fund such efforts in the South and Southwest. An accompanying note said she had become convinced that investing in these groups \u2014 and not in campaigns \u2014 was the path to building long-term power among minority communities. Democratic groups and candidates have changed as well, with organizations like the D.C.C.C. garnering praise from Georgia Democrats this cycle for investing earlier in the state. Black Democrats running statewide campaigns in the South have reflected the message of Ms. Abrams, who embraced the racial and gender diversity of the party\u2019s base. The fact that the winning presidential ticket included a Black woman was another sign that the Democratic Party had come to recognize the most consistent part of its voting and organizing base, said Melanie Campbell, who convenes a group called the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable and is president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s nomination \u201cwas that moment \u2014 for so many sisters \u2014 it was about more than just a ticket,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cIt was about having arrived to a place of being fully seen and fully respected as Black women.\u201d In a recent phone interview, Ms. Abrams, who is expected to run again for governor, recalled how she had driven to 150 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties before her 2018 bid, learning about places where local leaders said the party could be more viable. \u201cBut when I got into those places, there was always someone there to meet me \u2014 who had been waiting for someone to come to help connect and help them build this network,\u201d she said. \u201cSo whether it was finding Black voters in South Georgia, and working with Black immigrants in Gwinnett, or working with the A.A.P.I. community, or going to North Georgia and meeting with more and more Latino voters.\u201d (A.A.P.I. refers to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.) Ms. Abrams also said she disliked \u201ctrust Black women\u201d as a motto because it didn\u2019t reflect the diverse coalition that had brought change to the state. A New York Times analysis of Georgia voters found that turnout had increased among minority communities and in the diverse suburbs but that the biggest shift to Democrats was among white college graduates and wealthier residents. \u201cI appreciate the necessity of that battle cry,\u201d Ms. Abrams said. \u201cAnd in my approach, in Georgia in particular, Black women have been instrumental. But I chafe at this idea that we then objectify one group as both savior and as responsible party.\u201d Still, it was Black women who laid the organizing framework in Georgia, and who are doing so again ahead of the Senate runoffs. Ms. Ufot\u2019s group held a small celebration on the Saturday after Election Day, after Mr. Biden crossed the threshold of 270 electoral votes, but was back to organizing by that Monday. In Clayton County, south of Atlanta, Ms. Davis\u2019s small army of canvassers is encouraging residents to participate in the runoffs but is also focusing on a down-ballot race for the state\u2019s public service commission. Many voter registration efforts in Georgia are run by nonprofit, apolitical organizations, including the People\u2019s Agenda, Georgia Stand Up and the New Georgia Project, that target historically disadvantaged communities and nonwhite voters. Because those demographic groups tend to break for Democrats, and given that leaders like Ms. Butler and Ms. Ufot have professional and personal histories with people like Ms. Abrams, Republicans have sometimes cast the groups as unofficial wings of the Democratic Party \u2014 which has placed them under intense legal and journalistic scrutiny. The women who lead these groups say they take pride in their legal and operational independence and denounce the transactional nature of political campaigns and candidates. Their message, they say, is about turning passive constituents of a democratic society into active participants. It is an enduring effort that begins before the flood of candidate ads and party literature and continues long after. Ms. Butler, the head of the People\u2019s Agenda, said what had given her the most pride this year was not the Democratic success in Georgia, but the high turnout and continued ascendance of nonwhite voters. \u201cThe more people that get engaged in this, the more diverse opinions we have, I think we come out with better elected officials,\u201d she said. But those who are explicit about their partisan leanings said a blue Georgia was vindication after years of what-ifs and close calls. The next time they ask for investment and trust, it will be easier, they said. And for Black women everywhere, there is now a model for expanding their political power. \u201cWe are the home of Scarlett O\u2019Hara and \u2018Gone With the Wind,\u2019\u201d Ms. Davis said, referring to the 1936 plantation epic that was set in Clayton County. \u201cSo you have to think about it like that. What we\u2019re doing here is putting to rest some of the worst aspects of old Southern culture. And that\u2019s a powerful thing.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Meet Biden\u2019s Energy and Climate Cabinet Contenders WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s environment and energy team \u2014 facing a narrowly divided Congress and a hostile Republican leadership \u2014 will need creativity and perseverance if Mr. Biden is to follow through on his ambitious promises to address climate change. In November, Mr. Biden announced that former Secretary of State John Kerry, who made climate change a signature diplomatic issue during the Obama administration, will become an international \u201cclimate envoy.\u201d Mr. Biden also intends to name a high level domestic policy adviser on climate change this month. But the agency heads, whose names will be announced in the coming days, will be the ones tasked to find a path around Congress with regulations that can cut planet-warming emissions and survive judicial review. Here are the leading candidates: Mr. Biden\u2019s top candidate to lead the agency is Ms. Nichols, California\u2019s climate and clean air regulator, according to four people familiar with the matter. She said in an interview that she would accept the job. Ms. Nichols is the architect of her state\u2019s cap-and-trade climate change law, which capped greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, then allowed utilities to buy and sell emissions credits to keep polluting at lower levels. She also helped craft California\u2019s tough regulations on climate-warming auto emissions, which served as a model for President Barack Obama\u2019s federal climate policies, before they were rolled back by President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important to quickly reverse and stop a very large number of actions that were done by the Trump administration, and then to restore the agency\u2019s scientific basis for its work,\u201d Ms. Nichols said in a recent interview. Also in the running: Currently president of the National Wildlife Federation, Mr. O\u2019Mara is seen by many on the Biden transition team as a strong second choice to lead the E.P.A. if it appears that Ms. Nichols cannot win enough Republican Senate votes to be confirmed for the job. If confirmed, Mr. O\u2019Mara, 41, would be one of the youngest heads of a cabinet agency in recent history; he has long been described as a \u201cwhiz kid,\u201d fluent in complex environmental policy issues. Mr. O\u2019Mara has deep ties to Mr. Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware, and to the Biden family. As head of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 2009 to 2014, he worked closely with Mr. Biden\u2019s son Beau, then the state\u2019s attorney general. He has also served as head of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade program, and served on Mr. Obama\u2019s Task Force on Climate Adaptation and Preparedness. The former mayor of Greenville, Miss., and a regional E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, Ms. McTeer Toney currently serves as senior director of Moms Clean Air Force, an environmental group that fought President Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back or eliminate air, water and climate change regulations. A top choice of liberal activists, she would be the second Black woman to lead the E.P.A. The White House Council on Environmental Quality coordinates and helps shape environmental policy across an administration. If confirmed, Mr. Ali would focus attention on racial disparities in federal environmental policy. With more than 20 years of experience at the E.P.A., Mr. Ali currently serves as vice president of environmental justice, climate and community revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation. He founded the agency\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice and under the Obama administration served as a senior adviser to the administrator Gina McCarthy on environmental justice issues. Also in the running: Ms. Mallory served as the general counsel to Mr. Obama\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality, after more than 15 years at the E.P.A., where she ultimately served as the agency\u2019s principal deputy general counsel. She currently is the director of regulatory policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit group that has fought many of Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory efforts in court. Mr. Connor, a former deputy secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration, would be extremely qualified for the post. He worked in the department throughout the Clinton administration, including four years as director of the Secretary\u2019s Indian Water Rights Office. He later worked for then-Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, on land, water, energy and Native American issues before returning to Interior during the Obama administration. He is also a citizen of the Taos Pueblo, a sovereign nation near Taos, N.M., that is one of the country\u2019s 574 federally recognized Native American tribes. A coalition of Democrats, Native Americans and liberal activists have been urging Mr. Biden to nominate a Native American to head the agency, a move that would make history. A Native American has never been in a presidential cabinet, and the Interior Department has for much of the nation\u2019s history governed huge swaths of federal land, especially in the West, and often dislodged and abused Native Americans. Also in the running: The campaign for a Native American Interior secretary was built around one candidate, Ms. Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, who in 2018 became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. But many of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers fear that she lacks the experience to manage the sprawling complex agency. Ms. Haaland nonetheless remains a contender, in part because of her political star power. Among those campaigning for her are the Lakota People\u2019s Law Action Center and the actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo, who posted a video on Twitter with tribal leaders speaking on her behalf. Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who chairs the committee that oversees the Interior Department, sent a letter to Mr. Biden signed by at least 50 colleagues urging the nomination of Ms. Haaland, who has served on Mr. Grijalva\u2019s Natural Resources Committee since her arrival in Congress last year. A New Mexico senator who will retire at the end of the year, Mr. Udall has fought to protect federal property from oil and gas drilling and has promoted the designation of wilderness areas in his home state. If Mr. Udall is picked, he will be keeping up a family tradition: His father, Stewart Udall, served as Interior secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. A nuclear physicist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s second energy secretary remains in the running to return to his old post. Dr. Moniz, now president and chief executive officer of the Energy Futures Initiative, a research organization, served as an informal adviser to Mr. Biden during the campaign and several people who worked under him at the Energy Department said they would be thrilled to do so again. But Dr. Moniz has detractors. Liberal groups have protested some of the positions he has taken since leaving government, including a post on the board of Southern Company, an electric and gas utility company. They also objected to his endorsements of nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage as ways to fight climate change because they believe climate policy should focus only on renewable sources like wind and solar. Though his biggest legacy is helping to secure the Iran nuclear deal, Dr. Moniz played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Paris Agreement on climate change as well, working to make clean energy a core part of the accord. Under Mission Innovation, a parallel agreement to the Paris deal, 19 nations and the United States agreed to double research and development spending on carbon emissions-free energy. President Trump effectively backed out of the pact when he abandoned the Paris Agreement. Also in the running: Dr. Majumdar, who currently is heading Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team for the Energy Department, could become its secretary. Dr. Majumdar moved to the United States from India to earn a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to become the first director of Energy Department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program, where he tried to build strong relationships with Republicans as well as Democrats. Currently Dr. Majumdar leads the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University. One of the earliest female Rhodes scholars, Ms. Sherwood-Randall has a deep background in nuclear weapons, the largest part of the Energy Department\u2019s work, as well as challenges to the country\u2019s electric grid. A former adviser to Mr. Biden when he was in the Senate, Ms. Sherwood-Randall served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations working on foreign policy and national security issues. From 2014 to 2017 she was the deputy secretary of energy, leading the National Nuclear Security Administration. She also headed up an initiative to address challenges to the power grid. Mr. Zaidi, New York State\u2019s deputy secretary of energy and environment, is widely considered the front-runner for the role of domestic climate change coordinator. The new position would require someone who could work with cabinet secretaries and other high-level figures like Mr. Kerry. Mr. Zaidi served as associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Mr. Obama where he helped design the White House Climate Action Plan, a blueprint for cutting emissions. The former governor of Michigan and an adviser to Hillary Clinton on energy has been floated as a potential secretary of energy. But she\u2019s also under serious consideration for the domestic climate policy coordinator position, according to two people who said her years of executive experience make her an attractive pick.",

    "article_text": "Biden Made Sure \u2018Trump Is Not Going to Be President for Four More Years\u2019 President-elect Joe Biden was in a good mood as we talked on the phone Tuesday evening for an hour \u2014 he in Delaware and I in Bethesda, Md. He apologized, though, for being late. He had been following the breaking news that Attorney General William Barr had announced that the Justice Department had not uncovered any significant fraud that could have affected the results of the presidential election. It\u2019s all over. Biden joked that Barr had just called him, \u201casking if I can get him in the witness protection program for endorsing me.\u201d Considering the Trump team\u2019s hurricane of dishonest claims about the election, the president-elect was entitled to a little laugh at its expense. Otherwise, he was all business. Biden had a lot to say about how he intends to approach the current Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and his Republican colleagues in order to get his cabinet nominees \u2014 and as much of his agenda as possible \u2014 through the Senate; how he intends to reshape U.S.-China strategy; and why he is ready to return to the Iran nuclear deal, if Iran does, and end President Trump\u2019s sanctions on Iran. Biden also spoke in depth about his strategy to connect with rural Americans, who have become estranged from the Democratic Party. I did ask one personal question: What has it been like to win the presidency under such weird circumstances \u2014 with a deadly pandemic and an infodemic of Trump propaganda falsely claiming that the election was rigged? \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve done something good for the country by making sure that Donald Trump is not going to be president for four more years,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut there\u2019s been no moment of elation. It kind of reminds me of what\u2019s going on with all my grandkids. You know, here I got a granddaughter who graduates with honors from Columbia. There\u2019s no commencement. I\u2019m the commencement speaker. It\u2019s virtual. These kids are graduating with no parties. It\u2019s just one of those moments. There\u2019s a lot of work to do. I\u2019m just focused on getting some things done as quickly as I can.\u201d Exactly how much he will get done will depend to a large degree on two things, Biden noted. One is how Republicans in the Senate and the House behave once Trump is truly gone from power. And the other is how McConnell behaves if he continues to control the Senate. Biden\u2019s top priority, he said, is getting a generous stimulus package through Congress, even before he takes office. We are courting serious long-term economic harm if we don\u2019t deal with the fact that \u201cyou have over 10 million people out there who are worried [how] they can pay their next mortgage payment,\u201d and \u201cyou have a significantly higher number of people who have no ability to pay their rent.\u201d When people \u201care out of the work force too long, you know, that makes it a hell of a lot harder for them to get back in the work force,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMany of them are losing years and years of opportunity.\u201d The same is true when kids miss significant time in school. \u201cThey don\u2019t just lose that semester,\u201d he said. \u201cThey end up sometimes two and three years behind.\u201d A generous stimulus will actually generate economic growth without long-term fiscal harm if in the future \u201ceverybody pays their fair share, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd by that fair share, I mean there\u2019s no reason why the top tax rate shouldn\u2019t be 39.6 percent, which it was in the beginning of the Bush administration. There\u2019s no reason why 91 Fortune 500 companies should be paying zero in taxes.\u201d But the big question is whether he can get it past McConnell today or tomorrow if the Republicans continue to hold the Senate. A significant number of Republican senators could decide that they want to become deficit hawks again under a President Biden, after four years of uncontrolled spending under Trump that has brought the national debt to record highs. Biden was careful about how he talked about McConnell, who has been careful not to call Biden \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Biden obviously wants to keep the prospects of cooperation open \u2014 but also make clear that he may have more leverage with the American people than the G.O.P. realizes if Senate Republicans opt for full-on obstruction. \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of things that when McConnell controlled the Senate that people said couldn\u2019t get done, and I was able to get them done with [him]. I was able to get them to, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy.\u201d \u201cI think there are trade-offs, that not all compromise is walking away from principle,\u201d Biden added. \u201cHe knows me. I know him. I don\u2019t ask him to embarrass himself to make a deal.\u201d At the same time, if Republicans clearly \u201clet all this go down the drain\u201d just so a Biden administration will not get a win, that \u201cmay have an impact on the prospect of Republicans running for re-election in 2022.\u201d \u201cWhen you have cops and firefighters and first responders across the board being laid off, when you\u2019re not getting the kind of distribution of vaccines out to rural America,\u201d he said, \u201cit has to have some consequences.\u201d Having been through a lot of political seasons, Biden added, the world could change a lot for Republican lawmakers once Trump is gone, although he certainly will not be forgotten. \u201cMy favorable rating is now 55 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is down to 42 percent.\u201d A significant number of independents and some Republicans could start to look at the world very differently in the next few weeks, he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure [they] can sustain the position that we\u2019re not going to do anything to help the circumstances of keeping businesses open, making sure we could open our schools safely. It is kind of hard to go home\u201d if you are a Republican senator who says \u201clet the states go bankrupt.\u201d Republicans live in those states, too. On foreign policy, Biden made two significant points. First, I asked him whether he stood by his views on the Iran nuclear deal that he articulated in a Sept. 13 essay on CNN.com. He answered, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, but yeah.\u201d He had written that \u201cif Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations,\u201d and lift the sanctions on Iran that Trump imposed. The Iranians are clearly hoping for that. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said on Nov. 17 that a return to full implementation by the United States and Iran can be \u201cdone automatically\u201d and \u201cneeds no negotiations.\u201d The nuclear deal was signed in 2015. Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in May 2018, reimposing crippling oil sanctions on Iran, claiming that it was a bad deal to begin with and that Iran was cheating \u2014 which was not the view of our European allies or international inspectors. The view of Biden and his national security team has been that once the deal is restored by both sides, there will have to be, in very short order, a round of negotiations to seek to lengthen the duration of the restrictions on Iran\u2019s production of fissile material that could be used to make a bomb \u2014 originally 15 years \u2014 as well as to address Iran\u2019s malign regional activities, through its proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Ideally, the Biden team would like to see that follow-on negotiation include not only the original signatories to the deal \u2014 Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union \u2014 but also Iran\u2019s Arab neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this week, I wrote a column arguing that it would be unwise for the United States to give up the leverage of the Trump-imposed oil sanctions just to resume the nuclear deal where it left off. We should use that leverage to also get Iran to curb its exports of precision-guided missiles to its allies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where they threaten Israel and several Arab states. I still believe that. Biden and his advisers are aware of that argument, and do not think it is crazy \u2014 but for now they insist that America\u2019s overwhelming national interest is to get Iran\u2019s nuclear program back under control and fully inspected. In their view, Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon poses a direct national security threat to the United States and to the global nuclear weapons control regime, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilizing the region,\u201d Biden said. But the fact is, \u201cthe best way to achieve getting some stability in the region\u201d is to deal \u201cwith the nuclear program.\u201d If Iran gets a nuclear bomb, he added, it puts enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. \u201cAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability.\u201d Then, Biden said, \u201cin consultation with our allies and partners, we\u2019re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran\u2019s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile program.\u201d The U.S. always has the option to snap back sanctions if need be, and Iran knows that, he added. There is going to be a lot of debate about this in the coming months. On China, he said he would not act immediately to remove the 25 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on about half of China\u2019s exports to the United States \u2014 or the Phase 1 agreement Trump inked with China that requires Beijing to purchase some $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services during the period 2020 and 2021 \u2014 which China has fallen significantly behind on. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any immediate moves, and the same applies to the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudice my options.\u201d He first wants to conduct a full review of the existing agreement with China and consult with our traditional allies in Asia and Europe, he said, \u201cso we can develop a coherent strategy.\u201d \u201cThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our \u2014 or at least what used to be our \u2014 allies on the same page. It\u2019s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.\u201d China\u2019s leaders had their issues with Trump, but they knew that as long as he was president, the United States could never galvanize a global coalition against them. Biden\u2019s strategy, if he can pull it off, will not be welcome news for China. While Trump was focused on the trade deficit with China, with little success, despite his trade war, Biden said his \u201cgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China\u2019s abusive practices \u2014 that\u2019s stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations\u201d and forcing \u201ctech transfers\u201d from American companies to their Chinese counterparts. When dealing with China, Biden concluded, it is all about \u201cleverage,\u201d and \u201cin my view, we don\u2019t have it yet.\u201d Part of generating more leverage, though, is developing a bipartisan consensus at home for some good old American industrial policy \u2014 massive, government-led investments in American research and development, infrastructure and education to better compete with China \u2014 and not just complain about it. Both Democratic and Republican senators have draft bills calling for such a strategy. The U.S. semiconductor industry in particular has been lobbying for such an approach. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re going to fight like hell by investing in America first,\u201d said Biden. He ticked off energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research. \u201cI\u2019m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers\u201d and in education, he said. And this time, he insisted, rural America will not be left behind. There is no way Democrats can go another four years and lose almost every rural county in America. For their sake and the country\u2019s, Democrats have to figure out what is going on there and speak to rural voters more effectively. \u201cYou know, it really does go to the issue of dignity, how you treat people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think they just feel forgotten. I think we forgot them.\u201d \u201cI respect them,\u201d Biden added, and he plans to prove it by \u201ctackling the virus\u201d in \u201cred and blue areas alike.\u201d We have \u201cgot to end the rural health care crisis right now by building on Obamacare, assuming it survives at all, with a public option [and] automatically enroll people eligible for Medicaid. There\u2019s strong support for that \u2014 and particularly [from] people in rural states, like Texas and North Carolina, that reject expansion. We can boost funding. I visited 15 rural hospitals. And the biggest problem is there\u2019s not enough reimbursement for them to be able to keep open.\u201d And they are often the biggest employer in that town or city. A lot of these rural hospitals and clinics could benefit from telemedicine, but they don\u2019t have the broadband connectivity. \u201cWe should be spending $20 billion to put broadband across the board,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have got to rebuild the middle class,\u201d but \u201cespecially in rural America.\u201d Before we signed off, I asked the president-elect just how he reacted to Republican senators threatening not to confirm Neera Tanden as director of the Office of Management and Budget, because of her trail of nasty tweets about Republicans. Should nasty tweets be disqualifying in this day and age? \u201cThat disqualifies almost every Republican senator and 90 percent of the administration,\u201d Biden chuckled. \u201cBut by the way, she\u2019s smart as hell. Yeah, I think they\u2019re going to pick a couple of people just to fight [over] no matter what.\u201d Biden closed by reflecting on the ugliness of the last four years \u2014 first seeing the glass half empty but then deciding in the end, who knows, maybe it\u2019s half full. \u201cSeventy-two million people is a lot of people to vote for\u201d Trump, he said. But maybe, just maybe when Trump is gone from the immediate scene, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that ugliness stays. There may be 20 percent of it. Twenty five percent of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d But some portion has to come back to a place where we can collaborate. \u201cWe got to figure out how to work together,\u201d he said.

    "article_text": "A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts video filled with falsehoods. Increasingly isolated in the White House, President Trump on Wednesday released a 46-minute videotaped speech filled with lies in which he spoke angrily about a \u201crigged\u201d election even though his own attorney general and election officials across the country have attested to his loss. Mr. Trump posted a short, two-minute version of the speech on Twitter, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House and delivered behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal, with a link to the full version on his Facebook page. Saying that his remarks \u201cmay be the most important speech I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d the president once again refused to concede defeat in his bid for re-election almost one month after Election Day. Instead, he repeated a long series of false assertions about voter fraud, accusing Democrats of a conspiracy to steal the presidency. Twitter quickly labeled the post as \u201cdisputed.\u201d Facebook added a note that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who received almost 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes, is the projected winner of the election. The video, which a White House official said was recorded last week, was the in-person embodiment of Mr. Trump\u2019s staccato tweets during the past three weeks: one falsehood after another about voting irregularities in swing states, Democratic conspiracies, attacks on state officials and signature verifications. The president\u2019s rambling assertions in the video were drastically undercut on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr told The Associated Press that despite inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Mr. Trump continued to rage about voting irregularities in the video, a day after a Republican elections official in Georgia lashed out at him, saying the president was inspiring violence and was to blame for a wave of death threats. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager in Georgia. \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d At the end of the video, Mr. Trump improbably described himself as the defender of America\u2019s election system, saying he had been told that the single most important accomplishment of his presidency would be protecting the integrity of the voting system. It was unclear why Mr. Trump waited until Wednesday to release the video. But he made it public after a series of rebukes by members of his own party who have increasingly abandoned him as he clings to power by making baseless assertions about voter fraud that have been roundly rejected. The president\u2019s legal team, led by his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, has lost dozens of lawsuits in courts across the country while making wild allegations without any proof to back them up. Some of the president\u2019s key Republican allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have urged him to move on in recent days. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred this week to the \u201cnew administration\u201d that would be taking over next year, a clear signal to Mr. Trump that his time in office was coming to an end. Lawmakers in both parties have also signaled that they may be willing to defy his threat to veto the military spending bill unless Congress eliminates a legal provision that provides liability protection for social media companies. Those social media platforms remain the president\u2019s favorite method for disseminating false and misleading information. Within a few hours, his tweet had been \u201cliked\u201d by almost 134,000 Twitter users, and his Facebook video had been shared 93,000 times.",

    "article_text": "The Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, joined the Senate today, narrowing Republicans\u2019 majority. Senator Mark Kelly is no stranger to lonely missions. As a former astronaut, he traveled millions of miles in space piloting shuttles to the International Space Station on four different missions, one of them just months after an assassination attempt nearly claimed the life of his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. On Wednesday, he began another kind of lonely journey, becoming the first of a new class to be formally sworn into the Senate and one of just two Democrats to unseat a Republican incumbent this year. Last month, Mr. Kelly won a special election to serve the remainder of the late Senator John McCain\u2019s term. His arrival whittled Senate Republicans\u2019 narrow majority to 52-48, a distinction for Mr. Kelly that adds to the outsize profile he will wield as a freshman senator. It also dooms the already fraught nomination of Judy Shelton, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, whom the White House had hoped to confirm before the end of the lame-duck session. Mr. Kelly\u2019s victory over the Republican senator Martha McSally meant that for the first time since the 1950s, both Arizona senators are Democrats, underscoring the shifting demographics and politics of a former conservative stronghold. He joins Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. On the campaign trail, Mr. Kelly leaned hard into his biography as a former Navy captain and astronaut, adopting the mantra \u201cFull speed ahead.\u201d He had a compelling surrogate in Ms. Giffords, who spoke in personal terms about his commitment to both his country and to her, gesturing in an advertisement to how he had \u201chelped me through my darkest moments.\u201d \u201cEveryone continues to be inspired by Gabby\u2019s recovery, by Mark\u2019s devotion, and the courage it took for their family to re-enter public life and public service,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Wednesday. Mr. Kelly will work out of Mr. McCain\u2019s old office, and on Tuesday, Mr. Kelly and his family visited Mr. McCain\u2019s grave at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that we get to meet our heroes, and even less often that we get to call them a friend,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in his victory speech. \u201cI got to do that with Senator McCain.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Iran Moves to Increase Uranium Enrichment and Bar Nuclear Inspectors Iran responded Wednesday to the assassination of its top nuclear scientist by enacting a law ordering an immediate ramping up of its enrichment of uranium to levels closer to weapons-grade fuel. The measure also requires the expulsion of international nuclear inspectors if American sanctions are not lifted by early February, posing a direct challenge to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. It was not clear whether the action was the totality of the Iranian response to the killing of the scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, whom American and Israeli intelligence agencies regarded as the guiding force of past efforts by Tehran to design a nuclear weapon, or whether more was to come. Iranian officials have vowed to avenge his killing. The new law orders Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Agency to resume enriching uranium to a level of 20 percent immediately, returning Iran\u2019s program to the maximum level that existed before the 2015 nuclear agreement reached with the Obama administration. Uranium enriched to that level would give Iran the ability to convert its entire stockpile to bomb-grade levels within six months. Despite the lag time, the order to start the process may be seen by the Trump administration as a provocation in its waning days. Just three weeks ago, after news of modest advances in the size of Iran\u2019s nuclear stockpile, Mr. Trump asked his advisers about military options to stop the country from producing the fuel. He was talked out of considering an attack by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, one of the fiercest of the Iran hawks in the administration, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark A. Milley, among other senior officials. The new law also sets a two-month deadline for oil and banking sanctions against Iran to be lifted before inspectors are barred, creating a potential crisis for the early days of the Biden administration. The inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a branch of the United Nations, have been the main public source of information about the progress of Iran\u2019s program. The timing seems deliberately intended to press Mr. Biden to re-enter the nuclear deal with Iran immediately upon taking office. Mr. Biden has said he would be willing to do so, at least as a starting point, if Iran once again respected the limitations of the 2015 deal. The speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said the measure was meant to send the West a message in the aftermath of the assassination that the \u201cone-way game is over.\u201d Iran\u2019s Parliament, dominated by conservatives, initially passed the law in an angry session on Tuesday in which lawmakers fumed over the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh. A physicist and a high-ranking official in the Defense Ministry, he was killed on Friday in a complex ambush, the details of which are still being debated. A number of intelligence officials have said Israel was responsible for the attack, though the Israeli government has remained silent. \u201cThe criminal enemy will not feel remorse unless we show a fierce reaction,\u201d Mr. Qalibaf said. Lawmakers stood up in the chamber with fists in the air, chanting \u201cdeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cdeath to America\u201d as they passed the bill in a televised session. The law was ratified Wednesday by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, an appointed body that oversees the elected government. President Hassan Rouhani, whose government negotiated the 2015 Iran accord over the objection of Iranian hard-liners, had opposed the legislation, calling it counterproductive. \u201cThe government does not agree with this legislation and considers it damaging for diplomacy,\u201d he said Wednesday before the measure was ratified. His government is now obliged to carry out the law, though outside experts noted that it could slow-walk the effort, citing technical challenges. And ramping production up to the levels required in the bill would require revisions in the infrastructure deep inside Iran\u2019s main nuclear facility at Natanz \u2014 the same one that was hit by a devastating Israeli-American cyber-strike more than a decade ago. Uranium enriched to 20 percent purity is a quick hop to bomb-grade uranium, which is roughly 90 percent pure. But getting from the current levels of 4 or 5 percent enrichment to 20 percent is a far bigger leap than the final move to bomb-grade fuel. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though American intelligence assessed that Iran had a fully active, secret weapons program run by Mr. Fakhrizadeh until 2003. Israeli officials and some American intelligence officials believe that program has continued at a lower level; the scientist was slapped with new American sanctions in recent years. By mandating a restoration of production and enrichment levels, the new law essentially wipes away the last of the main constraints negotiated by President Barack Obama and a team of diplomats led by Secretary of State John Kerry. Under that agreement, which the Trump administration abandoned in 2018, Iran shipped most of its nuclear stockpile out of the country, to Russia. The agreement also limited enrichment to under 4 percent. A year after Mr. Trump pulled out of the nuclear accord, Iran began rebuilding the stockpile and inching up the enrichment levels. The new law is clearly designed as a pressure device aimed at removing economic sanctions, which have crippled Iraq\u2019s economy and choked off much of its oil exports. Barring international inspectors, the State Department said Wednesday, would violate Iran\u2019s legal obligations under existing nuclear agreements. \u201cWe have full confidence in the I.A.E.A. to continue carrying out its verification and monitoring activities in Iran, and to report to the board of governors if there is any shortfall in Iran\u2019s cooperation,\u201d the State Department said in an emailed statement. It was not immediately clear how long it would take Iran to reach 20 percent enrichment, but David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said it could be done in as little as six months. \u201cThey know how to do it,\u201d Mr. Albright said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve done it before. Something less than six months is the worst-case scenario if they devote all their resources to it.\u201d Mr. Rouhani\u2019s top adviser, Hesameddin Ashena, said that the brief window for Mr. Biden to act after taking office could allow the hard-line faction to take credit for lifting sanctions and for getting Washington to re-enter the nuclear deal by threat instead of by diplomacy. But it is far from clear that Iran will be willing to simply go back to the old levels. Some officials have demanded that the United States first pay reparations to Iran for lost oil sales since Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides have said that they could not imagine how that could be politically possible. And while Mr. Biden has said he wants to go back to the deal, he has also said that returning now to the original provisions, which expired in 2030, would be insufficient. The accord would have to be extended and expanded. The Biden transition team declined to comment on the Iranian law. \u201cI think the law is a clear sign that Tehran will not be taking a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude toward Biden\u2019s Iran policy,\u201d said Henry Rome, a senior Iran analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cTehran wants to be at the top of the agenda for the new administration, and escalating its nuclear program is a surefire way to do it.\u201d The concept of expelling inspectors is not a new one. North Korea did the same during a standoff with the Clinton administration in 1994, and also renounced the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, of which it was a member. In 2006 the North exploded its first nuclear device, and it has conducted a half-dozen or so tests since. Iran and North Korea have cooperated extensively on missile technology in the years since, and Iranian officials have carefully studied the North Korean experience. Katie Glueck, William J.

    "article_text": "As Trump Rages, Voters in a Key County Move On: \u2018I\u2019m Not Sweating It\u2019 DOYLESTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Even before the presidential transition was underway, Mike Carr had started to move on with his life. It\u2019s not as though much about American politics had changed in the immediate aftermath of the election, he noted. President Trump was still tweeting baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud in all caps; cable news panels were still debating the effect the frenzy of accusations would have on democracy. These were the kinds of things that, before the election, would have demanded Mr. Carr\u2019s full attention. For most of the president\u2019s term, Mr. Carr, a 53-year-old real estate lawyer, had been relentlessly attuned to the news cycle and the damage he felt Mr. Trump had done to the country. But ever since Nov. 7, when the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Carr has given himself permission to keep the television on mute. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight has been lifted,\u201d said Mr. Carr, who voted a straight Democratic ticket on Nov. 3, as he did in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice not to be as plugged in.\u201d In Bucks County, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia and one of the state\u2019s most consistently competitive counties down ballot, ardent Biden supporters like Mr. Carr could be forgiven for not unplugging entirely. Their candidate may have won their state by 1.2 percentage points, their county by more than four, but Mr. Trump and his legal team have continued to dispute the results, filing multiple lawsuits, losing multiple lawsuits and parroting unfounded allegations of fraud in the parking lot of a landscaping business not 45 minutes away. By trying to sow distrust in America\u2019s electoral infrastructure and egging on his advisers as they speak openly of a second term, Mr. Trump has confirmed some of his detractors\u2019 worst fears. Yet even in a state at the center of the president\u2019s attacks, in a county where pre-election tensions ran high, many Biden supporters find themselves increasingly comfortable tuning out, moving on and looking forward to January. As in other counties across Pennsylvania and the country, Bucks County has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with about 64 residents dying from the virus in November, the highest toll since the spring. For many voters here, worries about the virus, coupled with an overwhelming sense of Trump fatigue, have relegated the president to little more than a postelection footnote. Sure, these voters acknowledged, Mr. Trump may still hold the power of the presidency and may, in their estimation, have no qualms about abusing it. But when it comes to the results of the election, they\u2019ve taken to viewing his message as more of a nuisance with a sell-by date than a lasting danger to democracy \u2014 the rantings of a sore loser rather than the opening act of a coup by the leader of the free world. \u201cHe\u2019s just a whiny kid who didn\u2019t get his way. I\u2019m not sweating it,\u201d said Blake Lertzman, 39, while taking a smoke break outside his technology repair shop in the Bucks County seat of Doylestown. \u201cRight now it\u2019s all about the virus. I worry about me and my girlfriend and my community.\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent efforts to overturn the election, \u201cnobody cares,\u201d Mr. Lertzman went on, \u201cunless you\u2019re the kind of person who goes on Newsmax.\u201d Doylestown, which has about 8,300 residents and is over 90 percent white, leans further left than many other boroughs and townships in Bucks County. Nevertheless, many residents take pride in their region as an incubator of centrist politics, citing the county\u2019s record, for instance, of voting for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 while helping re-elect Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican. Republicans and Democrats alike here recall Mike Fitzpatrick, the moderate Republican congressman who died of brain cancer this year, with fondness. And while many Democrats lament that his brother and successor, Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 a Republican who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s First District and just won re-election by 13 points \u2014 voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, they will also note unprompted that Mr. Fitzpatrick was recently ranked by the Lugar Center, a nonprofit in Washington, as the most bipartisan member of the House. \u201cWe generally produce candidates in both parties that are pretty moderate,\u201d said Ron Strouse, the mayor of Doylestown, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cpractical progressive.\u201d \u201cThe history of ticket-splitting certainly showed this year.\u201d Still, like a number of other self-consciously moderate locales across America, Bucks County was not insulated from the partisan and cultural crosscurrents that defined the presidential election. And as the county seat, Doylestown played host to their suburban Philadelphia iteration. \u201cRallies, counter-rallies, protests, demonstrations \u2014 we\u2019ve had more than 45 since the beginning of this year alone,\u201d Mr. Strouse said. In early September, hundreds gathered in the borough for dueling Black Lives Matter and \u201cBack the Blue\u201d demonstrations, the latter of which included a sea of Trump merchandise and a man reportedly shouting racial slurs and displaying a Nazi salute. In October, as part of a pro-Trump \u201croad rally,\u201d more than 1,000 of the president\u2019s supporters clogged traffic for miles as they converged on Doylestown, where they were met by a counter-demonstration of Biden supporters. Local businesses boarding up in anticipation of summer protests, Trump supporters brandishing Confederate flags as they cruised down Main Street: Doylestown residents recited no shortage of ways their typically placid borough had seemed \u201ctense\u201d in the lead-up to the election. But in the weeks since, even as Mr. Trump has electrified much of his base with his false claims of fraud and his campaign\u2019s harried appeals via text to \u201cchip in $10\u201d to \u201cSTOP THE RADICAL Left from counting any ILLEGAL ballots,\u201d Doylestown has remained at a calm remove. Demonstrations by Trump and Biden supporters alike, once a near-constant presence across town, have ground to a halt. \u201cPeople are more willing to tune out the theater now,\u201d said Anthony Palazzolo, 30, who is a volunteer at the Doylestown Historical Society and a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it in small things, like people are less on their phones and interacting more on the sidewalks. People are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d According to Mr. Palazzolo and others, the growing sang-froid about Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy-mongering, even among the area\u2019s most ardent Democrats, is in part a credit to local party leadership, members of which were quick to present a unified front after the county\u2019s votes were tabulated \u2014 offering Bucks County residents a bipartisan show of confidence in their own results even as the president tried to seed doubt and promote division across the state. \u201cOur county had a great election, and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d said Pat Poprick, the chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee. \u201cI do not think there was any quote-unquote fraud here.\u201d Yet for all their fears of Mr. Trump, many Biden supporters here also expressed confidence that the country\u2019s democratic institutions and traditions were robust enough to withstand the president\u2019s attempts to subvert them \u2014 if only for two more months. Larissa Hopwood, 41, a children\u2019s musician and teacher, was among Mr. Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters in Doylestown, taking the lead in organizing pro-Biden rallies to counteract the steady stream of Trump demonstrations. Ms. Hopwood said the stakes of the presidential election could not have felt higher, particularly because she is the mother of a gender nonconforming child. The day after the election, she attended a \u201cProtect the Results\u201d rally in town. But armed with a confidence that, come Jan. 20, Mr. Biden will be president of the United States, no matter how many lawsuits Mr. Trump files, she has found herself embracing a new sense of lightness, however incrementally. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize it for awhile, but for a week after Biden won, I posted zero Instagrams,\u201d she said. \u201cI think my mind-set was, \u2018Let\u2019s just tune it out: We had our victory.\u2019\u201d Still, despite feeling perhaps a bit less compelled to post and engage daily with political content, she admitted being frustrated by how \u201cpuffy\u201d her social feeds seemed shortly after the election \u2014 posts about lighter topics like, say, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d or People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover. But any concerns about complacency among fellow progressives seemed to stem less from concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s language and actions in this moment, and more from a desire to maintain momentum heading into the Biden era. In other words, Ms. Hopwood said, she\u2019s not terribly worried that a presidential coup is afoot. \u201cThere are government employees in charge of making this transition happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we are still the United States.\u201d And ultimately, for Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters here, blocking out the president is all the easier when even the neighborhood\u2019s most outspoken Trump supporter seems to have moved on. Daniel Compain, 65, a Cuban-American who fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime as a child, beamed as he recalled how pedestrians would grimace as they passed the enormous Trump flag he\u2019d hung outside the window of his apartment near Main Street. In an interview at a Starbucks nearby, he maintained that he would not accept the results of the election until the Electoral College officially voted in mid-December. He also had questions, he said, about whether Dominion voting machines had deleted ballots cast for Mr. Trump, echoing false claims made by the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. And yet when asked why he had decided to take his Trump flag down, Mr. Compain responded as if the answer were self-evident. \u201cWell, the election is over,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden Shows Off a New Accessory: A Walking Boot WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 The president-elect of the United States clomped across a flag-studded stage on Tuesday, intending to introduce the economic team that, he hopes, will steer the nation through turmoil. In the process, he introduced the country to a less welcome companion: his walking boot. After a slip while playing with one of his dogs, a shelter German shepherd named Major, over the weekend, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., 78, suffered hairline fractures in his right foot, according to Mr. Biden\u2019s office and his doctor. The black boot was a souvenir of the injury poking out over a pant leg of Mr. Biden\u2019s signature navy blue suit. \u201cGood,\u201d Mr. Biden replied to a shouted query about how his foot felt when he arrived at the Queen theater, an event space here near his home. He proceeded to show off the boot to the cameras, quickly lifting his knee to display the contraption. Later, after his team introductions were done and he was walking offstage, Mr. Biden was peppered with more questions about the injury. He flashed a thumbs-up sign to the assembled members of the news media. The health of a president-elect is always an issue of vital national interest, and especially so for Mr. Biden, who at his inauguration will be the oldest president in American history. Although he released health information during the campaign, he was not always forthcoming about his health protocols in the coronavirus era. On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden often laughed off questions about his age \u2014 despite significant reservations, especially during the primary, among some voters \u2014 instructing skeptics to watch him in action as he bounded through parades and onto stages. He also discussed his Peloton workouts and weight routines. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor, Kevin O\u2019Connor, said the president-elect sustained the fractures in his \u201cmidfoot.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor also said Mr. Biden \u201cwill likely require a walking boot for several weeks.\u201d Mr. Biden spent Monday out of the spotlight, meeting virtually with staff and speaking with foreign leaders. But on Tuesday, the boot was visible at times as Mr. Biden stood behind a lectern, introducing his choices for jobs involving the economy and occasionally shifting his weight.  \u201cHe appeared to move without much difficulty, though he did favor the injured foot\u201d as he walked in for his remarks, a reporter covering him for the press pool wrote to the other members of the news media. A Biden spokesman did not respond to more detailed questions about how the injury occurred \u2014 Was Mr. Biden playing catch with his dog? Were they on a walk? \u2014 or about how Mr. Biden was feeling. Mr. Biden, who also has another German shepherd named Champ, has long been a dog owner. Bob Markel, a friend since childhood, said that around 50 years ago Mr. Biden told him that his two dogs at the time were named Governor and Senator. \u201cThese were sizable dogs,\u201d Mr. Markel recalled. \u201cThey were big, just like, apparently, the ones he\u2019s got now, that he\u2019s going to take to the White House.\u201d Former Representative Bob Brady of Pennsylvania, a longtime Biden ally, said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t meet Major, but I met Champ,\u201d describing the pet as \u201cgorgeous.\u201d \u201cHe was probably throwing something around, it could be a toy,\u201d he said, speculating on Mr. Biden\u2019s injury. \u201cI spoke with his guys. He\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine.\u201d Mr. Biden campaigned on a message of national unity, and Mr. Brady, alluding to reports about future Biden pets, suggested that the president-elect might extend a hand to fans of felines, too. \u201cI heard he\u2019s going to get a cat,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Cabinet Picks, Part 2: Antony Blinken What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump? Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak \u2014 a position influenced by hearing the stories of his stepfather, a holocaust survivor, and by witnessing, when part of the Clinton administration, the consequences of not having intervened earlier to stop the Rwandan genocide. But some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend. If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States is back and can be counted on. What course is he likely to steer through that narrow channel? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent for The New York Times. Mr. Blinken\u2019s extensive foreign policy credentials are expected to help calm American diplomats and global leaders after four years of the Trump administration\u2019s ricocheting strategies and nationalist swaggering. European allies of the United States have welcomed a president who doesn\u2019t see them as rivals. But with the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate, they are also wary. Mr. Biden wants to reactivate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but the killing of the top nuclear scientist in the Middle Eastern nation, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, could complicate that aim.

    "article_text": "Mr. Biden, Keep the Pressure on Hong Kong Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, two icons of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement, are going to prison. On Wednesday, Joshua was sentenced to 13.5 months, Agnes to 10 months and a third defendant, Ivan Lam, to seven months, for inciting, organizing or participating in an unlawful assembly at Hong Kong Police Headquarters in June 2019. (They had pleaded guilty.) But they might not get out for quite a bit longer than that: The Chinese government, acting through the Hong Kong authorities, has already pressed more charges. And its point, after all, is to stamp out dissent in Hong Kong. These charges were brought under the Public Order Ordinance, but since June 30 there is also the much more severe national security law. Twelve people who were caught at sea trying to flee Hong Kong in August have been in detention on the mainland since, reportedly with no access to lawyers. Activists like us \u2014 the authors, who are in exile and wanted for arrest or in the diaspora, and our comrades in Hong Kong who face imprisonment or persecution \u2014 will continue to campaign relentlessly against China\u2019s authoritarian expansion and try to safeguard what is left of Hong Kong\u2019s liberal institutions, for as long as we can. But we need the support of governments, businesses, universities, labor rights organizations and NGOs everywhere. If the world does not act resolutely to build a stronger alliance against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s increasing aggression, more activists will be sacrificed, and more essential democratic values, too. Hong Kong is at the front lines of the resistance against Beijing\u2019s authoritarianism; what happens there should matter to anyone anywhere who cares about the future of freedom, especially since Beijing is trying to export its high-tech, repressive ways to the world. The incoming Biden administration must not only remain critical of the C.C.P. regime but also have the courage to foster a new China policy that prioritizes human rights over other interests. Only then will the United States be able to restore its leadership in a global order committed to freedom, democracy, equality and multilateralism. In June 2019, before Joseph R. Biden Jr. had secured the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination as its presidential candidate, he tweeted: \u201cThe extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties & autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.\u201d Now that Mr. Biden is president-elect of the United States, we call on him to make good on that sentiment. The C.C.P. government has increasingly been imposing mainland-style authoritarian governance on Hong Kong, in the process scrapping its engagement to Britain under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and sabotaging the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle of governance for Hong Kong, two commitments Beijing undertook that were supposed to ensure a high degree of autonomy for the city until 2047. This summer, the C.C.P. imposed a far-reaching and extremely punitive national security law on the city. That law has since been invoked to arrest protesters, expel even moderate pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council and discipline teachers deemed to be insufficiently patriotic toward the mainland. Next in line may be the city\u2019s judges, district councilors, civil servants and even school children. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, delivered her annual policy address \u2014 the equivalent of the U.S. president\u2019s State of the Union speech \u2014 last week and said, among other things, that \u201cpositive values\u201d needed to be fostered among students, including \u201ca sense of identity, belonging and responsibility toward the nation, the Chinese race and our society.\u201d Thanks to years of unfair trade practices, the C.C.P. has been able to concentrate wealth and power. More recently, the Chinese government has managed to consolidate its grip by capitalizing on the Covid-19 pandemic: extending the digital surveillance of its citizens in the name of combating the virus or, while other governments struggle with health crises at home, clamping down on the Hong Kong democracy movement and asserting its presence in the South China Sea. This, even though by all serious accounts, the new coronavirus first appeared in China, and more and more reports and investigations \u2014 including a recent CNN analysis of leaked documents from Hubei Province \u2014 show that the Chinese authorities covered up news of the initial outbreak. In the past few years, the Trump administration took various measures to condemn the repression in Hong Kong. It terminated the city\u2019s special trade status; it imposed sanctions on C.C.P. and Hong Kong officials for cracking down on protesters. (Mrs. Lam recently said that she was receiving her government salary in cash, and had \u201cpiles\u201d of it at home, because no bank would give her an account anymore.) Other world leaders, various labor rights organizations and businesses have also begun to re-evaluate their misguided arrangements with China. Many have come to ask whether the allure of short-term financial gains should overshadow the prospect of other kinds of long-term losses. Imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, blacklisting C.C.P.-sponsored companies, investigating C.C.P.-funding at American universities and the activities of the party\u2019s so-called united front, its worldwide network of influence \u2014 all these moves serve the valuable purpose of signaling to China\u2019s leadership that it is violating global rules and that that won\u2019t be tolerated. Yet so far these efforts have not secured any substantial reform from the C.C.P. We hope that the Biden administration will review and reform asylum policies for Hong Kongers and take a close look at sanctions against those who attack the city\u2019s democratic institutions. Critical decisions also need to be made by the new administration about the protection of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet and strengthening diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Washington must craft a China policy that puts human rights front and center, but without neglecting the urgent need, too, for environmental protection, greater respect for labor rights and fair trade. That would continue to signal strong support not only for human rights activists or proponents of democracy in Hong Kong, but for all people who want to be free.

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s New Top Economist Has a Longtime Focus on Workers WASHINGTON \u2014 Soon after Cecilia Rouse finished her first stint as a White House economic adviser, in the administration of President Bill Clinton, a prestigious academic journal published what would arguably become her most famous research paper: a study finding sexism in auditions and hiring for symphony orchestras. To complete that study, Ms. Rouse and a co-author, Claudia Goldin of Harvard, conducted years of research. They worked with orchestra managers and unions to unearth records of auditions dating back decades. \u201cWe traveled from city to city,\u201d Ms. Goldin recalled, \u201crummaged through dusty boxes and copied hundreds of entries from yellowing pieces of paper.\u201d The effort reflected both a focus on the forces that hold people back in the economy and a degree of diligence in her research that Ms. Rouse\u2019s colleagues call trademarks of her second stint in the White House, when President Barack Obama tapped her to join his Council of Economic Advisers. And it is what friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms. Rouse to bring to the council if she is confirmed by the Senate to lead it under President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., a job that Mr. Biden said on Tuesday he would restore to cabinet-level status after it was demoted under President Trump. Ms. Rouse, who received her bachelor\u2019s degree and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, is currently the dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. She emphasized her interest in workers, and what hurts them and holds them back, at an introductory event on Tuesday with Mr. Biden and other nominees for economic posts in his administration. She said her mother, a school psychologist, had encouraged her to take an economics course as a freshman in college, which came during a national spike in unemployment. \u201cIt was impossible to separate what we were learning in the classroom from what I knew was going on in towns across the country,\u201d Ms. Rouse said, \u201cand I found myself drawn to study the labor market in all of its dimensions \u2014 the reasons that jobs disappear, the impact of education on people\u2019s job prospects, the ways we can tear down barriers to job growth and make it easier for people to find long-lasting economic security.\u201d Ms. Rouse will be a pioneer if confirmed \u2014 the first Black chair of the council. And she will take her position during a sagging recovery from a pandemic recession, at a time when millions of Americans have been out of work for months since the virus first surged through the United States. Austan Goolsbee, who led the council under Mr. Obama when Ms. Rouse was a member, said he expected Ms. Rouse to focus on challenges facing workers in the so-called gig economy \u2014 like drivers for ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft \u2014 and on workers who suffer long spells of unemployment in the crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Goolsbee said, \u201cshe was way ahead of everyone on the issues of the long-term unemployed. From the second the thing began, she was saying, we\u2019re going to have to think about the long-term unemployed and how to get them out of unemployment.\u201d Along with her symphony paper \u2014 which found women were substantially more likely to be hired for orchestras when participating in a \u201cblind\u201d audition with their gender concealed \u2014 Ms. Rouse\u2019s research has included work on school performance, educational vouchers and diversity in the economics profession. Ms. Goldin calls her \u201ca leading expert on core labor market issues as well as those in the field of education.\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said he would have not been surprised if Mr. Biden had chosen Ms. Rouse to lead the Education Department, instead of the C.E.A. But at the council, he said, he expected Ms. Rouse to employ a collaborative management style, in the model of another Princeton economist who went to work in government: Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair. In recent months, Ms. Rouse has advocated new federal protections for workers in response to the pandemic. In April she called for a law \u201cthat mandates (and perhaps subsidizes) paid sick leave, which has been shown to reduce turnover, increase productivity and lower overall health care costs for employers.\u201d At her introduction in Delaware, she called the pandemic a \u201cdevastating crisis\u201d but also \u201can opportunity to build a better economy in its wake \u2014 an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities, and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Biden and His Economic Team Urge Quick Action on Stimulus as Risks Mount WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday introduced the economic team he will rely on to help rebuild the U.S. economy at a perilous moment, with coronavirus cases soaring, the Federal Reserve chair warning of challenging months ahead and lawmakers in Congress still struggling to reach agreement on a rescue package. Mr. Biden, speaking in Delaware, called on Congress to pass a substantial relief package to help keep businesses, households and local governments afloat while his Treasury secretary nominee, Janet L. Yellen, called the damage done so far \u201can American tragedy\u201d that could lead to long-term devastation if not quickly corrected. \u201cRight now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. But he acknowledged that any stimulus agreement would necessarily fall far short of the trillions of dollars that Democratic leaders have insisted on for months, saying that \u201cany package passed in a lame-duck session is lucky to be at best just a start.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s nominees made it clear that they were thinking expansively about how to revive the U.S. economy and looking beyond just restoring lost jobs and livelihoods to finding ways to widen economic wealth, broaden opportunities and repair safety net programs. \u201cThis is a moment of urgency and opportunity unlike anything we\u2019ve faced in modern times,\u201d said Cecilia Rouse, Mr. Biden\u2019s nominee to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThe urgency of ending a devastating crisis. And the opportunity to build a better economy in its wake \u2014 an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.\u201d But those goals, which were at the center of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, are likely to run into obstacles in Congress, where Republicans, who spent the past four years on a spending spree, have resurrected their concerns about the federal deficit. They have cited it as a reason to forgo the kind of large stimulus package that Mr. Biden and other top Democrats have said is needed. The political divisions were on display Tuesday, as a bipartisan group of centrist senators announced in the morning that they were working on a $908 billion compromise stimulus package. By the afternoon, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced that he had been discussing his own proposal with Trump administration officials and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader. That package would be hundreds of billions of dollars smaller than the bipartisan plan \u2014 and thus a nonstarter with Democrats. But Mr. McConnell seemed to suggest that President Trump would not sign a more expansive bill, reminding Republicans in a private conference call and reporters during a news conference that a presidential signature is needed. The continued likelihood of congressional gridlock before Inauguration Day threatens to saddle Mr. Biden\u2019s economic team with dim prospects come Jan. 21, when it will confront an economy that has seen a slowdown in hiring growth, manufacturing activity and other key measures in recent weeks. Millions of Americans are set to lose unemployment assistance at year\u2019s end. Others could face eviction and foreclosure as government moratoriums expire. \u201cThe pace of improvement has moderated,\u201d the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, saying the rise in virus cases was \u201cconcerning and could prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d \u201cThe risk of overdoing it is less than the risk of underdoing it,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Administration officials have shown little sign of worry about recent economic developments, insisting the recovery is on track while Mr. Trump continues his legal quest to overturn his re-election defeat at the polls. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing alongside Mr. Powell, downplayed the broader risks facing the economy and blamed economic shutdowns in some states for slowing progress. While he called for targeted relief for sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, like restaurants and airlines, he said the economy had recovered faster than many had expected and that the economy had \u201cregained 58 percent of the lost jobs.\u201d He defended his decision to end several of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs on Dec. 31. He has also requested that the central bank return the Treasury funds supporting those programs. Democrats said the moves amounted to economic sabotage. \u201cEither you\u2019re purposefully trying to stop President-elect Biden and Janet Yellen from getting to work for the people we all serve, or you\u2019re so delusional that you think because the stock market is back up, everything is fine,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s malpractice.\u201d Mr. Powell, who told lawmakers that the Fed would have preferred to keep those lending programs going while acknowledging that it was Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s place to decide, painted a more dire picture of the economic outlook. He pointed to continued uncertainty around the speed of a vaccine rollout, the reality that millions remain out of work and the fact that small businesses could fail in the winter months. \u201cWe do have a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use our tools until the danger is well and truly past, and it may require help from other parts of government as well, including Congress.\u201d Republicans insist that the economy is recovering and that the United States does not need to borrow more money for another big relief package, while Democrats insist that a large jolt of stimulus is necessary and that now is not the time to worry about deficits. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason states and localities have to have a balanced budget but we\u2019re allowed to have a deficit to deal with crises and emergencies as we have in the past,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe have to keep vital public services running, have to give aid to local and state governments to make sure they can have law enforcement officers, firefighters and educators as we did in 2009.\u201d After months of deadlock on Capitol Hill, a bipartisan group of senators tried to move things forward with the $908 billion compromise stimulus proposal, funded in part by repurposing the money that Mr. Mnuchin clawed back from the Fed lending programs. The proposal, spearheaded by two centrists \u2014 Senators Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine \u2014 and a handful of senators from both parties, has not been publicly endorsed by either Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California or Mr. McConnell. Intended as a stopgap measure to last until March, it would restore federal unemployment benefits that lapsed over the summer, but at half the rate, providing $300 a week for 18 weeks, and does not include another round of checks for every American. The measure would provide $160 billion to help state, local and tribal governments facing fiscal ruin \u2014 a fraction of what Democrats had sought. Also included was $288 billion to help small businesses, restaurants and theaters, and a short-term federal liability shield from coronavirus-related lawsuits. In contrast, the framework circulated on Capitol Hill by top Republicans does not include funds for state and local governments and curtails a short restoration of federal unemployment benefits even further. \u201cThe advantage of our compromise bill is it has bipartisan, bicameral support,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI want a bill that can become law.\u201d The bipartisan plan is an attempt to find a middle ground between the dueling stimulus proposals that Democrats and Republicans have haggled over for months. Its cost is less than half of what Democratic leaders had pushed for in the weeks leading up to the election but nearly double the latest proposal from Republican leaders. It includes most of the main ingredients that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders have called critical for a deal, a possible sign that it could form a basis for a compromise that Mr. Biden could get behind. Asked about the plan by reporters after his event with his economic team, Mr. Biden replied: \u201cI just heard about it. I\u2019ll take a look at it when I get back.\u201d The fresh attempt at a bipartisan compromise came as Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin held their first phone discussion since late October, when they had a flurry of pre-election conversations that failed to culminate in a deal. Ms. Pelosi said she and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had sent a new proposal of their own to Republican leaders on Monday. John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group think tank in Washington, which has pushed for more small-business aid, said the bipartisan plan \u201cseems close to being the sweet spot\u201d for a possible compromise \u2014 if one is possible. Some Senate Republicans on Tuesday reiterated opposition to any deal that sends money to support state and local government budgets, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana challenging Mr. Powell at the hearing about whether states are really in such bad straits and suggesting the money would be used to shore up shaky pension funds. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, I think it\u2019s an area that\u2019s worth looking,\u201d Mr. Powell said, noting that states are among the largest employers in the economy and that they provide critical services. Mr. Biden\u2019s appointees all sounded an urgent tone as the incoming administration faces the prospect of a double-dip recession. His nominees, all of whom must win Senate confirmation, talked about the pain of the pandemic recession, noting that it was falling hardest on traditionally marginalized Americans and widening the divide between the rich and the poor. Ms. Yellen, a former Fed chair and an academic labor economist, said she had gone into economics \u201cbecause I was concerned about the toll of unemployment on people, families and communities.\u201d She warned that inaction in the face of the current economic crisis \u201cwill produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.\u201d Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Republican Resistance to Tanden Illustrates Trouble Ahead for Biden WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The fierce and pre-emptive Republican pushback against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s choice of Neera Tanden this week to head the White House budget office underscored the difficulties the incoming administration will face in maneuvering its nominees through a polarized Senate. In the 11 years since Mr. Biden served in the chamber, partisanship has intensified, and nominations \u2014 once an area dominated by courtesy, comity and a presumption of accommodation \u2014 have become just another brutal battlefield. Republicans will not be eager to accede to Mr. Biden\u2019s choices if they can find reason for opposition. And disparaging comments about Republicans on Twitter from Ms. Tanden, a longtime Democratic policy adviser and head of a liberal think tank, were enough for many Republicans to threaten the nomination well before it was made official on Tuesday. \u201cTrumpism has infected the entire Republican caucus,\u201d said James P. Manley, a former longtime top Senate Democratic aide, who urged the incoming administration to brace for intense opposition from Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cI am not sure everyone has figured out yet what is going on here, but I hope they will soon, and prepare for what is coming.\u201d Should Democrats win two Senate seats in runoff elections to be held on Jan. 5 in Georgia, the party would control the agenda and make approval of Mr. Biden\u2019s nominees much easier. But if Democrats fail, Republicans will have the power to decide the fate of Mr. Biden\u2019s executive and judicial branch picks. The reality of a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate will take some adjusting to on Capitol Hill after four years of Republicans working hand-in-hand with President Trump on nominations. Republicans said they were stunned by the selection of Ms. Tanden, whom many knew mainly as a hostile social media presence, to head the Office of Management and Budget. Even though many Republicans have refused to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner of the election, they said they were surprised that his team had not checked in with them on how they might react to her nomination to an agency that lawmakers in both parties see as critical when it comes to advancing congressional priorities. \u201cThat was just an unforced error,\u201d Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on Tuesday. He said that moving forward in future cases without weighing Republican sentiment was \u201ca roll of the dice\u201d that could cause unnecessary embarrassment to a nominee or to Mr. Biden\u2019s White House. Initially, Republicans \u2014 who had refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in 2016 \u2014 suggested that they might not even take up Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination were it sent to the Senate. But Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who is poised to be the top Republican on one of the two committees that would oversee hearings for Ms. Tanden, said he believed she should receive one even if he was skeptical about her chances of confirmation. \u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility,\u201d said Mr. Portman, who oversaw the budget office under President George W. Bush. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll get the votes.\u201d The handling of the announcement of Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination left some in both parties wondering whether Mr. Biden\u2019s team was misreading the environment on Capitol Hill, where voting against an administration\u2019s nominees has become essentially the default position for senators in the party out of power in recent years. But people close to the transition team said opposition to Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination from some Republicans was no surprise to the president-elect or his team, nor was it evidence that Mr. Biden, who served almost four decades in the Senate, was na\u00efve about what it would take to win confirmation of his choices. One person familiar with the deliberations said they expected as much from Republicans already angling to run for president in four years. Advisers said Mr. Biden was cleareyed about the need to use some of his political capital to fight for Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination, citing her years of policymaking experience and a compelling personal story as reasons to fight to get her confirmed. They noted that the reaction from Republicans to Mr. Biden\u2019s other nominees has been more muted, with some Republicans suggesting they would be willing to give the president-elect deference in terms of who he wants in his cabinet. One person close to the nomination process said that Mr. Biden and his team had, in fact, been reaching out to Republican lawmakers in recent weeks. Transition officials said the crisis situation in the nation makes quick confirmation imperative. \u201cThe country is facing multiple crises, from a pandemic that is killing over 10,000 Americans a week to a recession that is continuing to push thousands out of the work force,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a transition spokesman. \u201cThe American people cannot afford partisan obstruction of qualified and experienced women who are nominees.\u201d Democrats scoffed at the criticisms surrounding Ms. Tanden\u2019s selection, particularly over her Twitter feed \u2014 given that most Senate Republicans have diligently spent four years evading queries about the array of policy announcements, racist commentary and inflammatory attacks on their own colleagues from Mr. Trump on Twitter. \u201cAfter spending four years pretending that they didn\u2019t see the latest insane tweet from President Trump, Senate Republicans seem to have found a newfound interest in the Twitter feeds of President-elect Biden\u2019s cabinet selection,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor. \u201cA few critical tweets about substantive policy positions have caused Senate Republicans to label Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination \u2018radioactive.\u2019 Spare us the hyperbole.\u201d Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said he believed that Mr. Biden and his team should reach out to Capitol Hill about the looming nominations. He added that he had been in touch with some of the intended nominees about scheduling private, one-on-one meetings. (On Tuesday, Mr. Schumer\u2019s office circulated photographs of him in a video conference with Mr. Biden\u2019s choices for secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, and director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines.) \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most important first thing because there\u2019s nothing like making your case for yourself,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cFour years ago, President Trump put some nominees up \u2014 if they said things in tweets or whatever that we didn\u2019t like, we\u2019d ask them tough questions about that, so she will expect the same.\u201d Democrats also said they were astounded by calls from Republicans for extensive disclosures of business dealings from Mr. Biden\u2019s potential picks after the record compiled by Mr. Trump. \u201cThis is just stunning, even by the double standards of Washington,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who labeled the Trump administration \u201cthe Babe Ruth of darkness.\u201d \u201cThe Trump administration has stonewalled on so many things \u2014 starting with the president\u2019s taxes \u2014 and then they come in and the first thing they\u2019re doing is saying, \u2018Oh, my goodness, there\u2019s no transparency in the Biden administration,\u2019\u201d he added. Mr. Manley, the former Senate aide, urged Democrats to stand behind the new administration\u2019s nominees or face an onslaught of obstruction from emboldened Republicans. \u201cIf Republicans have objections to her policy views, they should give her a hearing and grill her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea that they are prepared to block her nomination because she was mean to them on Twitter is ridiculous, and no Democrat should fall for it.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Four Women Who Will Handle the Media in the Biden White House WASHINGTON \u2014 In one of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s closing campaign advertisements, he promised a \u201cnew world coming\u201d if Americans voted for \u201chonor,\u201d \u201cdecency,\u201d \u201crespect of office\u201d and \u201ctruth.\u201d The restoration of \u201ctruth\u201d was illustrated in the ad by a photograph of the podium in the White House briefing room, which under President Trump has been used to disseminate falsehoods and to undermine the credibility of a news media that his aides have referred to as the \u201copposition party.\u201d The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, for instance, recently refused to take a question from a CNN correspondent, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t call on activists.\u201d It was in the briefing room that Mr. Trump suggested that an \u201cinjection inside\u201d the human body with a disinfectant like bleach or isopropyl alcohol could help combat the coronavirus; and where his first press secretary, Sean Spicer, set the tone for the administration when he falsely claimed that the president\u2019s inauguration crowd was the \u201clargest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\u201d The relationship between a White House press office seeking to portray the president and his decisions in the best light possible and the news media seeking to separate fact from spin is designed to be adversarial. But Mr. Biden is entering office with the stated intent of restoring credibility to government \u2014 and to the briefing room. His advisers have said that the communications team will endeavor for a return to pre-Trump \u201cnormalcy.\u201d And that seemed to be reflected in the communications team he announced this week. \u2014 Annie Karni Mr. Biden\u2019s choice of Jennifer Psaki, 42, a veteran of the Obama administration who is generally viewed by reporters as fair and accessible, as his chief spokeswoman embodies that return to normalcy approach. Ms. Psaki, a former White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman, did not work on the Biden campaign. But she was brought in by two top Biden advisers, Jeffrey D. Zients and Anita Dunn, to help with the transition. Mr. Biden\u2019s decision to appoint Ms. Psaki as press secretary, a role in which she will become one of the most recognizable faces of the new administration, came together in a rush of meetings over the past 10 days. Mr. Biden, officials said, was particularly drawn to Ms. Psaki by her background at the State Department. There, she worked under Secretary of State John Kerry and grew comfortable delivering 90-minute briefings on foreign policy issues, like a dispute over the South China Sea. At the White House, Ms. Psaki intends to bring back the daily press briefing, which has been all but phased out over the past four years. It is not clear, however, when those sessions might resume, given the constraints of the pandemic. But as the incoming administration prepares to roll out a coronavirus vaccine and convince more than 300 million Americans that it is safe, Ms. Psaki, colleagues said, views a central part of her job as restoring faith in the words spoken from behind the podium. \u201cThe clown games are over,\u201d said Susan Rice, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cJen will represent the professionalism and decency and commitment to transparency that has been a hallmark of Joe Biden\u2019s career.\u201d As Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Ms. McEnany has focused on remaining in the president\u2019s inner circle and has made little effort to be accessible to reporters or to disseminate accurate information. Ms. Psaki plans to take a different approach, Biden transition officials said. At the State Department, they noted, Ms. Psaki moved the spokesperson\u2019s office, which had been on the sixth floor, where it was inaccessible to reporters, to be next to the press room. Ms. Psaki, pronounced SOCK-ee, was a candidate for the press secretary\u2019s job under Mr. Obama, but she is arguably coming into it now at a more difficult and more critical moment. \u201cI think she brings as much experience in that building, as much as anyone has ever brought to the job,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first White House press secretary. \u201cThe world this administration inherits has more challenges than any in nearly a century. Having a steady, experienced voice behind that podium will serve them well.\u201d Since leaving government, Ms. Psaki has worked as a senior vice president and managing director for the Washington office of Global Strategy Group, a public relations firm that works with corporate, nonprofit and political clients, and has served a principal at WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm founded by Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden\u2019s choice for secretary of state. Ms. Psaki, a graduate of the College of William and Mary, was most recently a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank, and a paid contributor on CNN, a position she left in September. She is expected to have access to Mr. Biden, whom she has known for 12 years. \u201cThe name of the game is access,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201cAre you in the meetings? Some of the best prep for the briefing itself was being in the meeting \u2014 understanding where the president\u2019s head was and where the debate was going.\u201d \u2014 Annie Karni Kate Bedingfield has spent the past two years as one of the most visible public faces of the Biden campaign. As communications director, she will help shape the message for the president and the White House. Mr. Biden is known for turning to loyal advisers, and Ms. Bedingfield has been a trusted aide since 2015, when she joined the vice president\u2019s staff as communications director as he was weighing whether to run for president in 2016. She was an original member of his 2020 campaign, serving as a deputy campaign manager and communications director. In that role, she often appeared on television as a surrogate for Mr. Biden, sometimes from her bedroom because of the pandemic. With Ms. Bedingfield running the communications operation, the campaign\u2019s message of unifying the country remained consistent from Day 1 through Election Day, even amid criticism and second-guessing from some Democrats. During the campaign, she was forced to navigate a number of public relations challenges, including the attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies on Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and his business dealings in Ukraine. Ms. Bedingfield and her team did not hesitate to press reporters on the word choices they made in describing the baseless accusations against Mr. Biden and his son. Ms. Bedingfield was also charged with trying to make a positive case for Mr. Biden after he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary, low points on the Biden campaign that at the time raised serious doubts about his path to the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThe job she did in the campaign is underappreciated,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as White House communications director for Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen a candidate comes in with the expectations and experience of Joe Biden and then falls so dramatically as he did, where he came in fourth and fifth, to hold a campaign together and keep the candidate focused and upbeat and optimistic is a very difficult task.\u201d Ms. Bedingfield, 39, who grew up in the Atlanta area and is a graduate of the University of Virginia, worked on John Edwards\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and in the Obama White House during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. She later worked as vice president of corporate communications for the Motion Picture Association of America and as vice president of communications for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the N.B.A.\u2019s Washington Wizards, the N.H.L.\u2019s Washington Capitals and the W.N.B.A.\u2019s Washington Mystics. \u2014 Thomas Kaplan  The president-elect is an institutionalist, a deal-making centrist and a consummate political insider who has hired a number of top advisers with backgrounds rooted in the traditional corridors of Washington power. One of his newly selected press aides brings a notably different perspective to the team. Karine Jean-Pierre, who was named Mr. Biden\u2019s principal deputy press secretary, has held a number of governmental and campaign roles. But she is steeped in grass-roots progressive activism, too, as a former chief public affairs officer at the liberal group MoveOn. She is also a former political analyst for NBC and MSNBC. Ms. Jean-Pierre has also spoken about her belief that her identity as a woman of color and daughter of Haitian immigrants cut a sharp contrast with the divisive and at times racist rhetoric promoted by Mr. Trump. \u201cI am everything that Donald Trump hates,\u201d she said in a video she filmed for MoveOn. \u201cI\u2019m a Black woman, I\u2019m gay, I am a mom. Both my parents were born in Haiti.\u201d Ms. Jean-Pierre, 46, served in the Obama White House and worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. She was also a deputy campaign manager for the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Martin O\u2019Malley, a former governor of Maryland, in 2016. But she was not an original member of the Biden campaign, arriving as a senior adviser last spring after Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon was brought on as campaign manager. Ms. Jean-Pierre later served as the chief of staff for Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. That job gave Ms. Jean-Pierre access to the candidate but did not require her to engage in the daily sparring with journalists that she may need to do in her new role, in which she is expected to work closely with Ms. Psaki. Ms. Jean-Pierre, a graduate of the New York Institute of Technology and Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, came up in New York politics, describing former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who recently died, as a mentor.  \u201cShe will bring a steadiness, an evenness,\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic strategist who knows Ms. Jean-Pierre from New York. \u201cShe also brings her own experience as the daughter of immigrants, as someone from the queer community, as someone who\u2019s a New Yorker.\u201d \u2014 Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan As Mr. Biden reveled in his Super Tuesday victories in March in a speech in California, two protesters threatened to ruin the moment, climbing onstage with the septuagenarian candidate. Symone D. Sanders did not waste any time. She charged forward and, with the help of Mr. Biden\u2019s wife, Jill Biden, and several aides, hauled one of the protesters away. Ms. Sanders is no stranger to brawling on behalf of her boss. She served as an outspoken senior adviser to Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, emerging as a prolific surrogate at news conferences and on social media. Now, she will be a senior adviser and chief spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, whom she advised during the general election, traveling with her and assisting with debate preparations. Ms. Sanders is expected to play key roles both in guiding the press operation and in advising as Ms. Harris pursues her own initiatives as vice president. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be able to work both worlds very, very well,\u201d said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and an incoming senior adviser to Mr. Biden in the White House. Ms. Sanders, 30, a Nebraska native, is fluent in both the language of the left and internet discourse \u2014 in contrast to some of Mr. Biden\u2019s longer-serving advisers \u2014 and she was an important point of contact for several key political constituencies during the race. But she does not have the decades of traditional campaign and Washington experience that many in Mr. Biden\u2019s orbit value. Indeed, she signed on with the Biden campaign after working as press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign at age 25. Yet a combination of loyalty to Mr. Biden and a different perspective from many in his inner circle helped Ms. Sanders become an important and respected voice in the campaign, and she was mentioned as a possible White House press secretary. In the vice president\u2019s office, Ms. Sanders will work closely with Ashley Etienne, the communications director for Ms. Harris who is a veteran of the Obama administration and also served as a top aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This year, Ms. Sanders, a graduate of Creighton University, published a book titled, \u201cNo, You Shut Up: Speaking Truth to Power and Reclaiming America.\u201d She has also done strategic communications consulting work, but does not intend to continue that while in government. In an interview, Ms. Sanders, who is Black, noted that the transition had rolled out at one time the White House communications team\u2019s leadership, made up entirely of women \u2014 both white women and women of color. \u201cThe most qualified people for the job also happen to all be women,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is historic. Not too long ago, the powers that be would not have picked us.\u201d \u2014 Katie Glueck",

    "article_text": "Mark Walker jumps into North Carolina Senate race, hoping to ward off Lara Trump and other potential rivals. WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Mark Walker announced on Tuesday that he would run for North Carolina\u2019s open Senate seat in 2022, kicking off what is likely to be a fierce Republican primary that could pit him against President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law in a key swing state. In an interview, Mr. Walker, a former Baptist pastor from Greensboro, sought to frame himself as a \u201cbridge builder\u201d between Republicans and groups that the party had struggled to reach in recent years, particularly Black voters. \u201cI am trying to make the case you might want to select somebody who has the ability, or the history to work with people from all different communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a track record of going to places and accomplishing things that Republicans have not been able to do.\u201d Mr. Walker, 51, announced last year that he would not seek re-election after a court ordered North Carolina to redraw its congressional map, making his district much more Democratic. He had been mulling a Senate run for months after Senator Richard M. Burr, a fellow Republican, decided to retire. By entering the race just days after North Carolina certified its November elections, Mr. Walker was aiming to potentially box out other Republicans contemplating getting into the race. Other Republicans who are eyeing Mr. Burr\u2019s seat include Lara Trump, the wife of the president\u2019s son Eric Trump; Pat McCrory, the former governor; Representative George Holding, who is also retiring; and Dan Forest, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year. Ms. Trump has told associates that she is considering entering the contest, and her campaign could be a test of the family\u2019s political staying power once Mr. Trump leaves the White House. Despite stylistic differences, Mr. Walker has been a close ally of Mr. Trump in the House and would welcome his support in the Senate contest. Still, he offered a subtle dig on Tuesday at the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who resides in Westchester County but has North Carolina roots. \u201cIf somebody wants to move to the state, legally they can do that, but it doesn\u2019t deter me,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI have nothing to say but good things about their family.\u201d At least one potential contender has already passed on the race. Mark Meadows, another North Carolina conservative and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said last month he would not run for the seat as some expected. Democrats see the seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2022. Erica D. Smith, a state senator has already indicated she will run again, after losing the Democratic primary this year to Cal Cunningham, who fell short in his bid to unseat Senator Thom Tillis. Other possible candidates include Josh Stein, the state\u2019s attorney general, and Jeff Jackson, another state senator.",

    "article_text": "Biden Faces a Balancing Act in Choosing Top Aides With Business Ties WASHINGTON \u2014 Five years ago, Jeffrey D. Zients was the head of the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council, working to push across the finish line a federal rule that would prevent financial advisers from taking advantage of retirees. He won praise from progressives for fending off fierce resistance from Wall Street and for fighting for consumer protections. These days, Mr. Zients is a co-chairman of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s transition team who is being watched warily by members of the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing. Progressive advocacy groups such as the Revolving Door Project and Justice Democrats, concerned that he would defend corporate America if given a top economic policy job in the Biden administration, pushed to keep him out of such a role. They view his recent work running an investment fund \u2014 Cranemere \u2014 and sitting on the board of Facebook as a detriment. The pre-emptive resistance to Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) from the left is the latest indication of how the Democratic Party has shifted in the dozen years since former President Barack Obama took office amid the financial crisis. Now, business and finance experience can turn otherwise qualified White House candidates into pariahs for progressives. Mr. Zients, 54, has emerged as an important power center in the Biden transition team and was mentioned as a possible candidate to once again lead the National Economic Council or head the Office of Management and Budget, a role he held in an acting capacity during the Obama administration. With those jobs set to be filled by others, Mr. Zients is the front-runner, according to people familiar with the transition team\u2019s plans, to be the Biden administration\u2019s Covid czar, steering the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a sign of the pushback to come, the Revolving Door Project, which has been urging Mr. Biden to keep corporate influence out of his administration, has compiled a 13-page document about Mr. Zients. The file highlights his wealth, his appetite for deficit reduction during the Obama years and his recent work as chief executive of Cranemere. In the Obama administration, \u201chis role was essentially to be a management consultant for the executive branch: cutting costs, finding efficiencies and looking at things like a businessman,\u201d the Revolving Door document says. The group points to the majority stake that Cranemere took in NorthStar Anesthesia, a company that provides anesthesia services to hospitals and medical offices, in 2018. It cites negative reviews that NorthStar Anesthesia received through the Better Business Bureau, including allegations of surprise billing and a threat to send a dental patient\u2019s bill to a collection agency during a dispute over insurance coverage. That matter was resolved, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. A spokeswoman for NorthStar said that within two months of Cranemere\u2019s acquisition of the company, it had ended its practice of \u201cbalance billing\u201d \u2014 charging patients the difference between the cost of their services and what their insurers will pay. Jennifer Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Biden transition team, said Mr. Zients opposes surprise billing practices. \u201cJeff, like President-elect Biden, supports legislation to stop surprise billing by forcing the entire health care system to limit patient payments to in-network rates for all procedures and providers not preapproved by the patient,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. Progressives have been pushing the Biden transition team to install their preferred candidates in top roles and have been fairly supportive of some of Mr. Biden\u2019s early picks. These include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, to be Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University labor economist, to run the Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, to lead the Office of Management and Budget. But others are triggering a backlash, including Brian Deese, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to head the National Economic Council, and Adewale Adeyemo, the president-elect\u2019s choice for deputy Treasury secretary. Both men have worked at the asset management firm BlackRock, and many in the progressive wing view deep industry ties as a red flag. \u201cDemocrats should over all be alarmed by any Democratic administration considering filling the White House with Wall Street insiders and corporate lobbyists,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a political action committee. Early in his career, Mr. Zients worked as a consultant at Bain & Company before joining the Advisory Board Company, a health care research and consulting firm, where he rose to chief executive. He helped lead a spinoff of that business, which became the Corporate Executive Board, and both companies ultimately went public, in 1999 and 2001. According to Fortune, the Advisory Board\u2019s profitable initial public offering helped fuel Mr. Zients\u2019s net worth, which the magazine placed at nearly $150 million by 2002. In 2009, Mr. Zients joined the Office of Management and Budget as \u201cchief performance officer,\u201d rising to prominence within the Obama administration as a \u201cMr. Fix-It\u201d with strong operations skills and a knack for solving tough problems. Obama administration officials remember him for reviving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website, HealthCare.gov, after glitches plagued its rollout. \u201cI call him the ultimate firefighter on these jobs,\u201d said Denis R. McDonough, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who asked Mr. Zients to take on the project of fixing the website in 2013. \u201cHe runs into the burning buildings. He doesn\u2019t ask why. He doesn\u2019t ask when. He doesn\u2019t ask who\u2019s going with him.\u201d Later in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, Mr. Zients led the National Economic Council, where he shepherded new regulations to crack down on payday lending and steered the development of the so-called fiduciary rule \u2014 a requirement that financial professionals put the interests of their customers with retirement accounts ahead of their own. The Labor Department rule, which the financial services and insurance industries strongly challenged, was struck down by a federal appeals court in 2018. Those efforts earned him accolades from some progressive Democrats. \u201cThe government needs talent and experience,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, which promotes Wall Street reform, and a member of Mr. Biden\u2019s transition review team for the Fed, banking and securities regulators. \u201cPeople who are going to try to regulate an industry as complicated as finance can\u2019t say we\u2019re only going to hire people who know nothing about finance.\u201d But his role as a bridge to business during the Obama administration has raised some eyebrows. Mr. Zients was one of the administration\u2019s chief liaisons to executives and lobbyists when anger at Wall Street over the 2007-8 financial crisis was still at its peak. Top lobbyists such as the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have praised Mr. Zients as someone who heard them out. Describing his desire to listen to business leaders, Mr. Zients told executives at a 2014 event at the Economic Club of Washington, \u201cYou are the customers, all of you as business leaders, in terms of growing the economy.\u201d After Mr. Obama left office, Mr. Zients joined the private equity investor Vincent Mai\u2019s Cranemere fund as chief executive. The private holding company has investors from United States, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and takes a long-term investing approach in the mold of Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Zients, who is on leave from Cranemere, also spent two years on the board of Facebook and was a member of the company\u2019s audit committee. He has told people that he had concerns about the company\u2019s direction and governance, and opted not to seek re-election to the board this year. Facebook has come under fire from Democrats for allowing the spread of disinformation and from Republicans who accuse it of censorship. Jeff Hauser, the director of the Revolving Door Project, said Mr. Zients\u2019s experience working in private equity and at Facebook was particularly problematic and could portend trouble for progressive causes in a Biden White House. And while he sees Mr. Zients\u2019s experience in the health care industry as useful for managing the pandemic response, Mr. Hauser said he was concerned that Mr. Zients could be too accommodating to business as vaccines are rolled out next year. \u201cDissemination and delivery of the vaccine will be a significant undertaking,\u201d Mr. Hauser said. He added that Mr. Zients understood how to do it, \u201cbut whether or not he would be too sympathetic to businesses in management of that power is to be determined.\u201d In a role directing the virus response, which will require coordination across government agencies and the private sector, corporate management experience could be an asset. Fred P.

    "article_text": "Biden introduces his economic team at a moment of big risks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced key members of his economic team on Tuesday, as he prepares to assume the White House at a moment when the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing and millions remain out of work. Mr. Biden, speaking at an event in Delaware, said he was building \u201ca first-rate team that\u2019s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis.\u201d The president-elect called on Congress to pass a \u201crobust\u201d rescue package to help households, businesses and state and local governments, saying many communities are \u201cteetering on the edge.\u201d Mr. Biden is poised to enter the White House at a time of national crisis amid the worsening virus outbreak. The Department of Labor and Department of Commerce have reported an increase in applications for state jobless benefits and a decrease in personal income. Coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks, a development that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell called \u201cconcerning\u201d in testimony before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it \u201ccould prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d In a sign of how critical a role economic policy will play in the Biden administration, the President-elect said he was returning the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers to a cabinet-level position. President Trump had demoted the C.E.A. chair during his administration. Mr. Biden has chosen Cecilia Rouse to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; she would be the first Black woman in the role. Ms. Rouse is a Princeton economist who worked on the Council of Economic Advisers during part of the Obama era and on the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Mr. Biden has warned of a \u201cvery dark winter\u201d ahead and called on Congress to pass relief to help workers, businesses, and state and local governments. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are preparing for what could be another economic downturn in early 2021. But another economic stimulus package has languished in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach a deal, though leaders of both parties have called for compromise in recent days. A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a potential compromise plan on Tuesday morning that appeared to fit the contours of what Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have said must frame any stimulus deal in Washington. They include additional aid to the unemployed and small businesses, along with money to help state and local governments patch budget holes that have been ripped open during the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s slate of nominees and appointees includes several women in top economic roles. The selections, markedly different from Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has been overwhelmingly white and male, follow Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise to build an administration that looks like America. His pick for the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress \u2014 would be the first Indian-American to lead the office if confirmed. Mr. Biden also selected Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, to be his Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to fill the position. Ms. Tanden has met immediate resistance from Republican senators who have criticized her for attacking Republicans publicly, including on her Twitter feed. She previewed the group\u2019s likely emphasis on personal stories in a Twitter post on Monday, after her nomination was announced: \u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity.\u201d Mr. Biden also announced his picks for deputy treasury secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, and members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Mr. Adeyemo served as a senior international economic adviser under former President Barack Obama, and Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey, a top policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, leads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality. The introductions follow a similar event last week, when Mr. Biden publicly introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team.",

    "article_text": "As uncertainty grows, Congress kick-starts stimulus talks. The country\u2019s economy, like the nation\u2019s politics, is queasily suspended between the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 at a moment when the rampaging pandemic has prompted deep concerns over the strength, timing and even likelihood of a possible recovery next year. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to inject a sense of urgency \u2014 and stability \u2014 into a chaotic postelection environment by formally introducing his economic team, whose governing philosophy marks a stark departure from President Trump\u2019s low-tax, low-regulation approach. \u201cLet\u2019s begin the work to heal, to unite, to rebuild an economy for all Americans,\u201d Mr. Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del. The new team, led by Mr. Biden\u2019s pick for Treasury Secretary, Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chair, will emphasize the need to immediately help households and businesses stay afloat amid the pandemic through the use of emergency appropriations and other forms of federal assistance, Biden aides have said. During his remarks, Mr. Biden directly appealed to senators who will vote on the confirmations of his cabinet members and who are likely to oppose some of his picks. \u201cTo the United States Senate, I hope those outstanding, these outstanding nominees receive a prompt hearing and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country,\u201d said Mr. Biden as he introduced his nominees including Neera Tanden, the combative head of a liberal think tank who is one choice likely to face some opposition. Earlier in the day, current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell backed that approach, warning Congress that \u201cthe outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain\u201d without an effort to bridge the dangerous transition by limiting the spread of the virus and supporting the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s departing Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, offered a much less dire assessment of the economy in his prepared remarks before the Senate Banking Committee. But there were signs that the two sides were attempting to bridge the gap. Mr. Mnuchin told reporters he was planning to reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss negotiations over another virus relief package. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, unveiled the blueprint for a $900 billion stopgap stimulus package later in the day. The plan would provide $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits for 18 weeks, half of what Democrats have sought, and it includes $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, much less than the $500 billion Democrats had previously proposed, which congressional Republicans and the White House had firmly rejected. In his testimony, Mr. Mnuchin proposed spending an additional $300 billion on relief \u2014 a move that was instantly attacked as insufficient by Democratic members of the panel. \u201cI continue to believe that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday. \u201cThe administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses.\u201d Yet even as most congressional Republicans refuse to publicly acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, many in the party are starting to privately adjust to negotiating with a Biden team whose coordinated activity represents a sharp break from Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach that had often involved back-room diplomacy with Democrats beyond the reach of his volatile boss.",

    "article_text": "Biden Pick for Treasury\u2019s No. 2, a Moderate Voice, Breaks Racial Barrier WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaking at a Washington think tank in the summer of 2016, Adewale Adeyemo, President Barack Obama\u2019s international economics adviser, warned about the perils of protectionism, explained how a growing Chinese economy was good for the world and talked up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal he helped negotiate that Democrats ultimately rejected. Four years later, such talk might sound out of touch with a Democratic Party that has become even more hawkish on China and increasingly wary of sprawling international trade deals. But that was not a concern for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who this week tapped Mr. Adeyemo to be deputy Treasury secretary, solidifying his team with another stalwart veteran of the Obama administration who would bring center-left economic ideas, deep experience and diversity to Mr. Biden\u2019s top ranks. Like many of Mr. Biden\u2019s hires so far, Mr. Adeyemo, who goes by Wally, brings a mainstream policy perspective with a background that breaks barriers. Mr. Adeyemo would be part of a history-making duo at Treasury: He would be the first Black deputy at the Treasury, serving with the first female secretary, Janet L. Yellen. And like some of Mr. Biden\u2019s picks, the selection of Mr. Adeyemo is coming under scrutiny from the left over his private-sector work. In 2017, after the Trump administration took over, Mr. Adeyemo went to work for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, as a senior adviser and interim chief of staff to Larry Fink, its chief executive. He left last year to become president of the Obama Foundation, where he managed day-to-day operations and carried out its strategic plan. If confirmed, Mr. Adeyemo will have risen to the Treasury\u2019s No. 2 spot from humble beginnings. Born in Nigeria, he emigrated with his parents to the United States when he was a baby and settled in Southern California outside Los Angeles. His father was a teacher, his mother a nurse. Mr. Adeyemo, 39, and his younger brother and sister grew up sharing a room in a two-bedroom apartment. As he was introduced by Mr. Biden on Tuesday, Mr. Adeyemo talked about his desire to reduce inequality in the United States and increase the fortunes of the middle class. He described his roots growing up in a state that was hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn California\u2019s Inland Empire, where I had grown up in a working-class neighborhood, the Great Recession hit us hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were one of the foreclosure capitals of the United States. The pain of this was real for me.\u201d Mr. Adeyemo attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he was the president of the students\u2019 association, and went on to get a law degree from Yale. His interest in policy percolating, he worked on the presidential campaigns of John Kerry, John Edwards and Mr. Obama. Mr. Adeyemo joined the Treasury Department in 2009, working as deputy executive secretary to Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Just over a year later, he was dispatched to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help get the new agency up and running. There, he worked as chief of staff for Elizabeth Warren, now a senator from Massachusetts, who had come up with the idea for the consumer bureau and was picked by Mr. Obama to oversee the agency\u2019s establishment. The ability to toggle between the likes of Mr. Geithner and Ms. Warren was an early sign of Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s knack for straddling the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party\u2019s policymaking machine. At his 2015 confirmation hearing to be the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for international markets and development, Ms. Warren offered effusive praise. \u201cHe remembers who he grew up with, and he tries every day to make this a better country,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who became one of the most prominent progressives within the Democratic Party. A spokeswoman said Ms. Warren would support Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s nomination as deputy secretary. Mr. Adeyemo ultimately became deputy chief of staff at the Treasury, serving under Jacob J. Lew. In that role, he was immersed in many issues including sanctions and international trade. During the negotiations over the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Adeyemo was focused on brokering a deal over currency provisions in the agreement\u2019s foreign exchange chapter. Mr. Lew recalled Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s flying across the world from Asia to Latin America and engaging in economic shuttle diplomacy to broker an agreement that would create greater transparency and enforcement of foreign exchange policy in the deal. \u201cHe put together an approach that frankly has withstood the test of time, even though TPP has not had U.S. participation,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview. \u201cIt became the model of how currency issues were dealt with in subsequent trade agreements.\u201d In 2015, Mr. Obama recruited Mr. Adeyemo to the White House to be his international economic adviser on the National Security Council. He represented the president at the Group of 20 and Group of 7 summits and steered the international economic policy agenda across government agencies. The soft-spoken and deliberate Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s approach will provide a stark contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s combative tone in economic diplomacy. At the 2016 event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. Adeyemo described the importance of encouraging China to liberalize its markets by making the case that doing so was in its own economic interests \u2014 and in the interests of the United States. \u201cA growing Chinese economy is an economy where U.S. companies can sell goods and services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a growing Chinese economy is something that will help boost global growth.\u201d That multilateral approach to dealing with China could be a complication for Mr. Adeyemo at his confirmation hearing, as Republicans have become accustomed to Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational stance. And Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s work at BlackRock will probably raise questions from some Democrats, as progressives have already expressed their displeasure. Robert Kuttner, founder of The American Prospect, a progressive publication, warned this week that BlackRock could stand to gain if Mr. Adeyemo got the No. 2 job at the Treasury, saying he could work to prevent tougher regulatory oversight of the asset manager. Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a left-leaning group that targets corporate power, suggested that BlackRock worked to implant officials that would do its bidding inside the federal government. \u201cBlackRock needs to be broken up and regulated,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cBlackRock C.E.O. Larry Fink knows this, so he\u2019s been storing hack Democrats on ice so they can go into the Biden administration and make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d A BlackRock spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A Biden transition team aide said Mr. Adeyemo, who was hired to establish BlackRock\u2019s internal think tank, did not have any business responsibility for or oversight of its investments or policy decisions. The aide said the experience also deepened Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s understanding of financial markets and the role that firms like BlackRock play in creating wealth for the middle class. David S. Cohen, the Treasury\u2019s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence during the Obama administration, said Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s familiarity with the inner workings of the Treasury and experience with domestic policy, international economics and national security would make him a strong partner for Ms. Yellen, who is an academic economist and former central banker. \u201cIn some respects, he\u2019s a perfect complement to Yellen at Treasury,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.",

    "article_text": "The World in a Vise: Sounding the Alarm on China, Then Running for Shelter SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 For the past few years, Australia has positioned itself at the front of a global effort to stand up to China. It was the first country to ban Huawei\u2019s 5G technology, to pass foreign interference laws aimed at curbing Chinese influence, and to call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus. Now, Australia is sounding an even louder alarm. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, already vexed by China\u2019s blockade of Australian imports \u2014 wine, coal, barley and cotton \u2014 demanded on Monday that the Chinese government apologize for a lurid tweet showing an Australian soldier with a knife at the neck of an Afghan child. The world, he warned, was watching. But even as he elevated a Twitter post to a four-alarm diplomatic fire, he also called for a reset with Beijing, reiterating that Australia\u2019s end game was still \u201cthe happy coexistence of two partners.\u201d In that somersault, Mr. Morrison inadvertently let the world hear Australia\u2019s internal dialogue of doubt \u2014 one that echoes around the globe as China increasingly asserts its might. The prime minister gave voice to the insecurities and anxieties that come with being caught between two superpowers. Those jitters are partly about the limited options in the face of China\u2019s tightening vise. But they are also about an America in flux. At a time when Australia\u2019s favored nation status with the Trump White House is about to expire, there is widespread concern that a Biden administration will focus less on America\u2019s Pacific partners and more on rebuilding ties in Europe. That has pushed Australia deeper into a position of pleading for help in corralling China even as it beats its chest for sovereignty. \u201cOn one level, the prime minister\u2019s reaction was completely reasonable. On another, it\u2019s at the upper limit of what\u2019s acceptable without making things worse,\u201d said John Blaxland, a professor of international security at the Australian National University. \u201cHe\u2019s got to tread a very fine line because Australia\u2019s leverage is limited.\u201d The country\u2019s entire history since settlement has been shaped by unquestioned dependence on an alliance with a distant and dominant power, first England, then the United States. The prospect of an end to that stability, with American decline or indifference and Chinese dominance, fills most Australians with dread. David Brophy, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese history at the University of Sydney, said it had created a counterintuitive dynamic. China often condemns Australia for doing America\u2019s bidding, when in fact, Australia is trying desperately to cajole the United States into deeper engagement. \u201cThe American presence in Asia is more important for Australia than it is for America,\u201d Mr. Brophy said. \u201cWhen Australia sees any hint of withdrawal, as we saw at the beginning of the Trump administration, it stirs up this sense of panic. It\u2019s not enough to wait for the U.S. to get back in the game; Australia has to show it can do more and will do more.\u201d Increasingly, that has meant tolerating economic pain and abandoning the approach Australia has long followed with China \u2014 say little and do what must be done. Mr. Morrison\u2019s government and China\u2019s propaganda machine have instead been trading blows and turns at the microphone. Geoff Raby, a former Australian ambassador to China, described it as a self-perpetuating cycle of paranoid provocation. \u201cThey are each confirming the other\u2019s worst suspicions,\u201d he said. Whispered complaints are out, replaced by competing news conferences and laundry lists of grievances. Australia has launched two foreign interference investigations with high-profile raids. It now plans to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over China\u2019s blocking of barley imports \u2014 one of many products that China has rejected as tensions have soared. Two weeks ago, in turn, a pair of Chinese Embassy officials summoned an Australian reporter to a meeting and delivered a set of 14 grievances. They included academic visa cancellations, \u201ca crusade\u201d against China\u2019s policies in Hong Kong, a call for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, a ban on Huawei in 2018, and the blocking of 10 Chinese foreign investment deals. \u201cIf you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy,\u201d one of the officials said. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (and the official who posted the doctored photo), called at the time for Australia to \u201creflect on this seriously, rather than shirking the blame and deflecting responsibility.\u201d That, of course, is exactly what the Australian government has demanded from China with the coronavirus inquiry, which Beijing treated like a dropped grenade. Explosive exchanges and accusations of hypocrisy now seem to come in volleys. The tweet from Mr. Zhao, a known provocateur, had an obvious goal: to deflect criticism of China\u2019s human rights abuses by sensationalizing an investigation by the Australian military that found its troops had unlawfully killed 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners over an 11-year period. Mr. Morrison could have ignored the provocation. Instead, he pounced, and after Mr. Morrison\u2019s apology demand, the Chinese government paid little mind to his request for a reset and dialogue. The official response arrived a few hours later when a government spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, suggested that Australia seemed to be indifferent to the killings. \u201cThe Australian side is reacting so strongly to my colleague\u2019s tweet. Does this mean they think the cruel killing of Afghan lives is justified?\u201d Ms. Hua said. An editorial in the state-run Global Times added: \u201cThe Morrison administration is making Australia provocative and wanting a spanking.\u201d And on Tuesday, China accused Australia of intentionally \u201cmisreading\u201d the tweet to deflect criticism. Beyond the juvenile threats lies a more serious and intractable disconnect. In the eyes of China\u2019s most nationalist ideologues, Australia is violating the most basic rule of China\u2019s rise: If you get rich with our help, stay quiet and grateful. Few countries have gained as much wealth from China\u2019s growth as Australia, and since coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has made clear that he expects silence and harmony from all who benefit from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s prosperity. \u201cNever allow singing to a tune contrary to the party center,\u201d he once wrote in comments that appeared on party and university websites in 2014. \u201cNever allow eating the Communist Party\u2019s food and then smashing the Communist Party\u2019s cooking pots.\u201d In the case of Mr. Zhao\u2019s tweet, Mr. Xi has said nothing \u2014 further highlighting the asymmetry of Mr. Morrison\u2019s complaint about a spokesman\u2019s social media post. To some of Mr. Morrison\u2019s critics, the photo looked like internet trolling that he should have ignored or responded to at a lower level. \u201cThey seem to have intended to make Morrison angry, and to goad him into exactly the kind of emotional response that he has now given them,\u201d said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. \u201cAnd that is worrying. In any fight like this one, be very careful not to do what your adversary wants you to do.\u201d Whether Mr. Morrison gets any aid from the United States or elsewhere, Mr. White added, the episode has already made Australia and Mr. Morrison \u201clook rattled and weak.\u201d That makes China look more powerful and intimidating. \u201cThe folks in Beijing do not want us to like them,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThey want us to understand their power and their willingness to use it. Our problem is that we are being rather slow to realize that their power is real.\u201d Chris Buckley contributed reporting.",

The U.S. economy is in a precarious state and Congress is consumed by partisan politics. Ms. Yellen, however, is no stranger to crisis or political machinations. She served as a top economic adviser in the Clinton White House. She was among the first economists to spot the housing bubble.

    "article_text": "For Manchin, a Divided Senate Is a \u2018Golden Opportunity\u2019 for Action WASHINGTON \u2014 A year ago, Joe Manchin III was ready to quit. As the most conservative Senate Democrat, he saw nothing but dysfunction and inaction when he looked around on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis place sucks,\u201d he repeatedly declared. As he often has since arriving in Washington, he openly mulled leaving to try to reclaim his old job: governor of West Virginia. Instead, he stayed for a second term. Now, with President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. preparing to govern from the middle in a Congress whose thin majorities will force him to compromise on almost every priority, Mr. Manchin, a centrist, suddenly finds himself at the center of relevance in the nation\u2019s capital. In his office on a recent afternoon, seated not far from a framed quote from President John F. Kennedy stressing independence from political party, Mr. Manchin, 73, was feeling energized. He paged through a proposal he was developing for a new coronavirus relief deal and said he was imagining a more moderate course for Congress. \u201cI think we have a golden opportunity to bring the country back together and for us to work in the middle,\u201d Mr. Manchin said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the reason why: The numbers are so close with what the Democratic House members lost. For Nancy Pelosi, she\u2019s going to have to work with people that have a more moderate view than some of the people that pushed her from the left.\u201d If Democrats are able to win two runoffs in Georgia in January and take control of the Senate, any plans to enact a liberal agenda \u2014 such as increasing the number of Supreme Court justices \u2014 will have to go through Mr. Manchin. Likewise, if Republicans win at least one of the Georgia races, allowing them to maintain Senate control, they will need centrists in both parties to help block progressive items or pass compromise legislation. That is the situation that Mr. Manchin said he considered more likely. He is already preparing for a power dynamic that he asserted would give him and three moderate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 a big role in determining what happens at the dawn of Mr. Biden\u2019s presidency. With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris empowered to break ties, Mr. Manchin noted that it would take only two Republican defections to hand Democrats a majority on any given measure. \u201cIt behooves everybody to start working together,\u201d he said during a wide-ranging interview in his office. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t take many of us to say, \u2018Guys, we\u2019ve given all of you a chance. We haven\u2019t done our job for the last 10 years, and we\u2019re going to start.\u2019\u201d In recent days, Mr. Manchin has been working to corral support for a new coronavirus stimulus package, racing around the Capitol asking his colleagues what price range they are comfortable with and directing his chief of staff, Lance West, to draw up proposals. Mr. Manchin said he thought about $1.2 trillion might be acceptable to finally reach a deal \u2014 about half of what his party\u2019s leaders had been pushing for before the election. He has been in talks with a bipartisan group of senators to try to forge a deal. They include the three Republican moderates, as well as Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; Senator Angus King, independent of Maine; and the Democratic senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Warner of Virginia. \u201cSomething needs to be done before Joe Biden becomes president,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got people who aren\u2019t going to make it to February or March.\u201d He is also ready to do battle with the progressive left, whose ire he drew when, in an interview this month with the Washington Examiner, he responded to a question about some liberals\u2019 calls to defund the police with the phrase, \u201cDefund, my butt.\u201d In response, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand from New York, posted a photo on Twitter of her glaring at Mr. Manchin as he applauded during President Trump\u2019s second State of the Union address. \u201cI guess she put the dagger stare on me,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the young lady \u2014 I really don\u2019t. I never met her. I\u2019m understanding she\u2019s not that active with her bills or in committee. She\u2019s more active on Twitter than anything else.\u201d That amounts to a sharp insult in a chamber where legislative prowess is prized. Mr. Manchin said he would stand firm against the agenda that the left flank of his party is pushing. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to defund the police, we\u2019re not for the new green deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019re not for Medicare for All \u2014 we can\u2019t even pay for Medicare for some.\u201d Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, said the congresswoman had submitted more amendments than 90 percent of other freshmen \u2014 including those promoting fair housing and a tear gas ban that passed the House \u2014 and had missed fewer votes than Mr. Manchin. \u201cThe congresswoman has earned a reputation as a tough, prepared member in committee hearings,\u201d Ms. Hitt said. Mr. Manchin is also a staunch opponent of another step for which progressives have advocated, having loudly spoken out against a move to change Senate rules so that the majority could muscle through legislation with a vote of 51, rather than requiring that bills meet a 60-vote threshold to advance. Should Democrats win control of the chamber, the change would allow Mr. Biden to circumvent Republican opposition and push through his policy priorities. \u201cI can assure you I will not vote to end the filibuster, because that would break the Senate,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to blow up the Senate to do the right thing, then we\u2019ve got the wrong people in the Senate.\u201d Instead, Mr. Manchin said he and a group of like-minded senators in both parties \u2014 including many of those with whom he is discussing a new relief package \u2014 were eyeing a different change to the rules to empower the rank and file. Their idea is to allow any bill approved by a committee with bipartisan support to advance to the floor. That would dilute the unilateral power of the majority leader \u2014 currently Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky \u2014 to control which measures advance. \u201cBefore we know definitely who is going to be the majority leader, we should make the changes of how the Senate should work,\u201d Mr. Manchin said of the proposal, which is exceedingly unlikely to be successful. Still, John C. Kilwein, the chairman of the political science department at West Virginia University, said Mr. Manchin would be \u201cincredibly important\u201d in the event of a 50-50 Senate. His stances would also serve as useful cover for Mr. Biden and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, from criticism they are likely to face for not fully embracing the progressive agenda. \u201cHe dashed progressives\u2019 hopes already of doing away with the filibuster and packing the court,\u201d Mr. Kilwein said. In some ways, Mr. Manchin is a throwback to a bygone era. A gun owner who grew up in the small town of Farmington, W.Va., and lives on a houseboat while in Washington, he keeps photographs of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on his office wall. Teaming up with Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, Mr. Manchin tried in 2013 to craft some modest gun safety measures to prevent such mass killings from happening again, but their efforts stalled amid bipartisan opposition. He often describes having learned to govern with \u201ccommon sense\u201d from watching small-town officials navigate problems like whether to put in or take out a stoplight. Charles S. Trump IV, a Republican state senator from West Virginia who has known Mr. Manchin for three decades and is not related to the president, said the senator took after his uncle A. James Manchin, an \u201cicon of West Virginia politics.\u201d The elder Mr. Manchin was an entertaining politician who rid the state\u2019s countryside of thousands of junked cars and old tires. As the state\u2019s working-class rural white voters \u2014 who once voted for Democrats partly because of strong ties to labor unions \u2014 shifted to the right, few Democrats could continue to win in West Virginia. The president won the state by nearly 40 percentage points this year. But Mr. Manchin held onto his seat in 2018, surviving the steepest re-election challenge of his career partly on the strength of the trust he has built with constituents over decades. Mr. Trump, the state senator, recalled how Mr. Manchin as governor cut short a trip in 2006 to attend the Sugar Bowl in Atlanta, where he planned to cheer on the West Virginia University Mountaineers, when there was a mine disaster back home. \u201cHe came straight home,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe knew it would be important to the people during a crisis that he was there.\u201d This year, Mr. Manchin crossed party lines when he became the only Democratic senator to endorse Ms. Collins in her fourth re-election attempt against a strong challenger, Sara Gideon, whom many in Congress expected to win. When Ms. Collins defied the polls, Mr. Manchin was one of the first to call and congratulate her. \u201cHe\u2019s courageous,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI admire he does the things he believes are right, even if he gets a lot of grief from the Democratic leader for it.\u201d Ms. Collins said she looked forward to working with Mr. Manchin on issues such as reducing the price of prescription drugs and a broad infrastructure package. But the obstacles are steep, with powerful groups on both sides of the political spectrum \u201cdemanding 100 percent compliance\u201d with their views, she said. Ms. Murkowski said she hoped a functioning Senate was not \u201ca pipe dream from a bygone era.\u201d \u201cFor those of us more in the moderate camp, it\u2019s a very important role that needs to be played, and I\u2019m looking forward to playing a part in that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the bitter partisan divide we\u2019ve seen. I want to try to figure out how we are governing again for all the country, not just for the Republicans.\u201d",

    "article_text": "It\u2019s Time for a Woman to Run the Defense Department President-elect Joe Biden has begun to announce his intended cabinet nominees, and it\u2019s an impressive and diverse group: his picks include an experienced African-American diplomat for ambassador to the United Nations; the first Latino nominated as homeland security secretary; and the first woman tapped to serve as director of national intelligence. Mr. Biden has remained silent, however, about whom he might select as secretary of defense. For years, the betting has been on Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, an under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration who is widely viewed as one of the nation\u2019s top defense policy experts. But although Ms. Flournoy \u2014 for whom I worked from 2009 to 2011 \u2014 is reported to still be a leading contender, along with a number of other well-regarded women, there has recently been speculation that Mr. Biden may instead choose one of several men also said to be on his short list. That would be shortsighted. If Mr. Biden nominates a respected and highly qualified woman as his secretary of defense, he would send an important and long overdue message \u2014 that the Defense Department\u2019s old norms and biases were a disservice not only to women working in national security, but to the country. The Defense Department has long been viewed as singularly inhospitable to women. National security leaders (nearly always male) have for years argued that there just weren\u2019t enough qualified female candidates to fill senior positions in the Defense Department \u2014 an excuse that might once have had some validity, but rings hollow today. Over the last two decades, an impressive new generation of female defense experts has emerged. There are now scores of talented women who have spent years mastering everything from military strategy to budgeting, logistics and acquisitions. In September, the Leadership Council for Women in National Security \u2014 which I co-founded and whose advisers include such luminaries as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and retired Adm. Michelle Howard, the Navy\u2019s first female African-American four-star \u2014 provided the Biden transition team with the names of at least four qualified women for every Senate-confirmed national security position. If it took decades for a sizable pool of highly qualified women to emerge as potential senior Pentagon leaders, that\u2019s no accident. For most of our nation\u2019s history, overtly discriminatory legislation and Defense Department rules severely limited women\u2019s ability to rise. In recent years, even as other foreign policy agencies opened their senior ranks to women, the doors at the Pentagon remained largely closed. At the end of the Obama administration, for instance, women made up 41 percent of senior State Department officials, but just 22 percent of senior Defense Department civilian officials, according to a 2018 analysis conducted by New America. In the uniformed military, gender equality has proved even more elusive than racial equality. Racial discrimination in the military was barred by a 1948 executive order, and the first African-American four-star general was appointed in 1975. In 1989, the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was appointed. But in the very same year the military was ordered to integrate racially, Congress also passed legislation mandating that women make up no more than 2 percent of military personnel \u2014 a cap that was lifted only in the 1970s. Even today, women constitute only 16.5 percent of the active duty force, and the first female four-star general wasn\u2019t appointed until 2008. Until 2015, women were also barred from serving in combat roles. This made it difficult for women to gain senior military positions, which go mostly to those with distinguished combat records. And since nearly half of all Defense Department civilian employees are military veterans who get preferential hiring, the same discriminatory policies that kept most uniformed women out of senior jobs also made it tougher for civilian women to be hired and promoted on an equal basis. These laws and policies weren\u2019t just unfair to women, they also diminished the country\u2019s ability to develop smart, effective national security policies. Studies suggest that organizations with gender-diverse leadership teams outperform organizations with male-dominated leadership, and that diverse organizations are less prone to \u201cgroupthink.\u201d On average, women appear to have more collaborative leadership styles than men, and they\u2019re also less likely than men to fall prey to judgment errors induced by overconfidence. Wouldn\u2019t it be wiser to have more collaboration, less groupthink and less recklessness in our military policy? The United States faces national security problems ranging from the pandemic to climate change, refugee crises and the rise of near-peer competitors such as China. These complex and interconnected issues require fresh approaches, not a reversion to old modes of thinking about defense policy. If Mr. Biden chooses a woman as his secretary of defense, it will pack a uniquely powerful symbolic punch \u2014 signaling both his repudiation of the Defense Department\u2019s history of sex-based discrimination and his intent to build the kind of diverse, innovative national security leadership team the nation so urgently needs. Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown Law and a co-founder of the Leadership Council for Women in National Security, is the author of \u201cHow Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cTangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Economic Team Suggests Focus on Workers and Income Equality WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. formally announced his top economic advisers on Monday, choosing a team that is stocked with champions of organized labor and marginalized workers, signaling an early focus on efforts to speed and spread the gains of the recovery from the pandemic recession. The selections build on a pledge Mr. Biden made to business groups two weeks ago, when he said labor unions would have \u201cincreased power\u201d in his administration. They suggest that Mr. Biden\u2019s team will be focused initially on increased federal spending to reduce unemployment and an expanded safety net to cushion households that have continued to suffer as the coronavirus persists and the recovery slows. In a sign that Mr. Biden plans to focus on spreading economic wealth, his transition team put issues of equality and worker empowerment at the forefront of its news release announcing the nominees, saying they would help create \u201can economy that gives every single person across America a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s picks include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, as Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse of Princeton University, to head the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress think tank, to run the Office of Management and Budget. All three have focused on efforts to increase worker earnings and reduce racial and gender discrimination in the economy. Ms. Tanden said in February that rising income inequality was the consequence of \u201cdecades of conservative attacks on workers\u2019 right to organize\u201d and that labor unions \u201care a powerful vehicle to move workers into the middle class and keep them there.\u201d The two other nominees to Mr. Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, are economists who have pushed for policies to advance workers and labor rights, and who advised Mr. Biden in his campaign as he built an agenda that featured several longstanding goals of organized labor, like raising the federal minimum wage and strengthening \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements in federal contracting. Ms. Boushey has also been a vocal advocate of policies to help working families, including providing up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. In an interview last week, Ms. Boushey said such a policy was especially critical during the pandemic, \u201cwhen lives are at stake.\u201d William E. Spriggs, the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor union, hailed the selections, saying in an email on Monday that \u201cwe have not had a C.E.A. as focused on the role of fiscal policy and full employment since President Johnson.\u201d The team has embraced increased federal spending to help households and businesses during the pandemic, a position that was highlighted in an op-ed article that Ms. Tanden and Ms. Boushey wrote with two co-authors in March, urging policymakers to spend big even though it would require borrowing large sums of money. \u201cGiven the magnitude of the crisis,\u201d they wrote, \u201cnow is not the time for policymakers to worry about raising deficits and debt as they consider what steps to take.\u201d Mr. Biden also named Adewale Adeyemo, a senior international economic adviser in the Obama administration, as deputy Treasury secretary. The nominees, who require Senate confirmation, will be introduced on Tuesday. Another of Mr. Biden\u2019s picks, the former Obama adviser Brian Deese, has been tapped to lead the National Economic Council but was not included in Monday\u2019s announcement. Mr. Biden\u2019s team includes several labor economists, including Ms. Yellen, who has been a longtime champion of workers and has at times suggested allowing the unemployment rate to run low for a longer period of time without worrying about inflation \u2014 an idea some economists thought imprudent but which has since become more widely accepted. While at the Fed, she balanced her preference for a strong labor market with inflation concerns and political constraints. In the early 2000s, Ms. Yellen was instrumental in persuading the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee to coalesce around targeting a 2 percent inflation rate instead of the zero inflation rate that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair at the time, originally favored. The Fed raises rates to slow the economy and offset inflationary pressures, so targeting slightly higher inflation opened the door to longer periods of cheap borrowing that can lead to stronger economic demand and lower unemployment. As Fed chair from 2014 to 2018, Ms. Yellen favored a patient approach to policy-setting that weighed concerns that prices might heat up as joblessness dropped against a preference for pulling more workers into the labor market. In one wonky 2016 speech, she suggested that allowing the labor market to expand without raising interest rates might help to reverse damage by pulling people in from the sidelines and prompting others to look for better jobs. She was criticized for the remarks, and later backed away from such an approach in word if not in deed. She and her colleagues lifted interest rates to fend off inflation pressures, but did so at a very slow pace, prompting criticism. Those rate increases have since been viewed as too aggressive and faulted for prematurely snuffing out a more robust labor market expansion. Ms. Yellen also walked a careful line when it came to issues like inequality. In one 2014 speech, she suggested that widening income and wealth inequality might be incompatible with American values \u2014 \u201camong them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity\u201d \u2014 a remark Republicans criticized. Much has changed since Ms. Yellen was at the Fed \u2014 in ways that could allow her to embrace some of her more labor-friendly instincts if she is confirmed to the Treasury. While the Treasury secretary\u2019s direct economic power is somewhat limited, the position holds significant sway as a fiscal policy adviser to Congress and the president, as well as oversight of tax policy through the Internal Revenue Service. Inflation, once seen as a real and looming threat, has been low for more than a decade. Inequality, once labeled a political and liberal issue, is increasingly recognized as a real economic constraint by Democrats and Republicans alike. Yet some progressive groups have raised concerns that Mr. Biden\u2019s team could pivot too quickly to try to reduce the federal budget deficit once the pandemic subsides, citing past comments by Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden. Economists on the left have become increasingly comfortable with deficit spending, and Ms. Yellen has long favored government intervention as a way to get the economy going during times of trouble. But she has also said America\u2019s debt load is unsustainable, and has generally favored taxation as an offset to increased spending. Mr. Biden, too, has expressed support for borrowing money to aid the current recovery, but sought to offset the cost of other economic proposals \u2014 like an infrastructure bill and actions to mitigate climate change \u2014 with tax increases on high earners and corporations. In a 2018 interview at the Charles Schwab Impact conference in Washington, Ms. Yellen said the U.S. debt path was \u201cunsustainable\u201d and offered a remedy: \u201cIf I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\u201d Last year, she described the need to overhaul the nation\u2019s social safety net programs as \u201croot canal economics.\u201d But Ms. Yellen has made clear that she does not see deficit reduction as a priority during the current crisis and that the federal government should spend what is necessary to weather the pandemic. In July, she testified before Congress with Ben S. Bernanke, another former Fed chair, and called for substantial federal support. \u201cWith interest rates extremely low and likely to remain so for some time, we do not believe that concerns about the deficit and debt should prevent the Congress from responding robustly to this emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cThe top priorities at this time should be protecting our citizens from the pandemic and pursuing a stronger and equitable economic recovery.\u201d Many Republicans, however, have once again begun warning about the deficit and citing mounting debt levels as a reason to avoid another large virus spending package. Bridging those concerns will fall to both Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden, whose role as the White House budget director will put her in the center of fiscal fights with Congress. Some liberal groups have raised concerns over Ms. Tanden\u2019s 2012 remarks to C-SPAN about potential cuts to safety-net programs as part of a long-term deal to reduce federal debt. In that interview with the network, Ms. Tanden said that the restructuring of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be \u201con the table\u201d in conversations about long-term deficit reduction and noted that the Center for American Progress had made such proposals. But in 2017, as Republicans prepared to approve a $1.5 trillion tax cut, Ms. Tanden showed no desire to return to deficit reduction in a future administration. \u201cThe rule seems to be deficits only matter for Democratic presidents,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd that rule needs to die now. We should not have to clean up their mess.\u201d Liberal senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, cheered the selections of Mr. Biden\u2019s team, including Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden. Mr. Brown said on Twitter that Ms. Tanden was \u201csmart, experienced, and qualified\u201d and demanded that Senate Republicans confirm Mr. Biden\u2019s team. Republicans did not unite in opposition, though when asked about Ms. Yellen, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, criticized her as being a \u201cgood example of the corporate liberals.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s somebody who clearly has done the bidding of the big multinational corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cHer record on trade is astoundingly terrible.\u201d Liberal economists welcomed the picks. \u201cThere are reasons to be hopeful,\u201d said Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University and the author of the book \u201cThe Deficit Myth,\u201d which makes a case that budget deficits are not inherently bad. Ms. Kelton helped with economic agenda-setting during the Biden campaign as a task force member, and said the fact that people like Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Boushey were included among the economic thinkers was a reason to hope that progressive ideals would have a voice at the table. That said, Ms. Kelton said she remained wary that there would be continued attention to deficits and deficit reduction.",

But Mr. Pai undid the rules within a year of being appointed by President Trump. Mr. Pai eliminated lower-profile rules governing the telecommunications industry, loosening media ownership restrictions and lifting some price caps in the lucrative market for business broadband connections. He also faced a global race to develop next generation wireless networks and more recently was drawn into the debate over the rules governing social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.

    "h1": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration",
    "first_p": "Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there. ",
    "article_text": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there.  The case is Batalla Vidal v. Wolf. Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who handed down the order, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must \u201cpost a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order ... that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA\u201d because the department\u2019s ostensible leader tried to limit the DACA program without having the authority to do so. The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to end the program. In 2017, Trump\u2019s DHS issued a memo that sought to wind down the DACA program, but the Supreme Court ruled last June that DHS\u2019s initial attempts to end it were void because the department did not adequately explain why it was doing so. Rather than fully reinstating DACA following the Supreme Court\u2019s order, however, DHS issued a new memo in July signed by Undersecretary of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Strategy, Policy, and Plans Chad Wolf \u2014 and the lawfulness of this July memo was the central issue in Batalla Vidal. \u201cI have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,\u201d Wolf wrote in that memo.  The memo directs \u201cDHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to reject all pending and future initial requests for DACA,\u201d and it provides that current DACA beneficiaries may only receive one-year renewals of their DACA status, rather than the two-year extensions they would have received prior to this memo. Wolf, moreover, purported to be far more than a mere undersecretary in his memorandum. In November of 2019, President Trump named Wolf acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and Wolf signed his July memo as \u201cActing Secretary.\u201d This distinction matters because as undersecretary, Wolf lacks the power to make changes to DACA, but the Secretary of Homeland Security does have the authority to make such changes. Judge Garaufis ruled in mid-November that Wolf \u201cwas not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Homeland Security Act (\u2018HSA\u2019) when he issued the July 28, 2020 memorandum,\u201d thereby cutting the legs out from under Wolf\u2019s attempt to water down the DACA program. If Wolf is not the acting secretary, then his July memo is void. The order Garaufis handed down on Friday lays out some of the consequences of the judge\u2019s mid-November decision. \u201cBecause Mr. Wolf was without lawful authority to serve as Acting Secretary of OHS, the Wolf Memorandum is VACATED,\u201d Garaufis wrote in his most recent order. So the good news for DACA-eligible immigrants is that, barring a decision from a higher court blocking Garaufis\u2019s most recent order, those immigrants will soon be able to obtain DACA status. And even if the order is blocked, President-elect Joe Biden has also pledged to fully reinstate DACA once he takes office on January 20. Nevertheless, the future of DACA remains uncertain. For one thing, the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision blocking the Trump administration\u2019s initial attempts to end the program was a  5-4 decision, with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the majority. Since then, Trump has replaced Ginsburg with the far more conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And even before Barrett arrived at the Supreme Court, several members of the Court had signaled that they thought DACA is illegal. So there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the Court\u2019s new 6-3 Republican majority will strike down the DACA program even as Biden tries to preserve it. The logic of Garaufis\u2019s November opinion \u2014 that presidents have only limited authority to make acting appointments \u2014 could also come back to bite Biden, especially if Republicans control the Senate and, with it, the power to block Biden\u2019s nominees. The core issue in the Batalla Vidal case turns on whether Wolf was lawfully appointed acting secretary, and therefore is empowered to make changes to the DACA program. Garaufis\u2019s opinion holding that Wolf was not lawfully appointed is fairly straightforward. The Homeland Security Act provides that, if DHS\u2019s top job becomes vacant, the deputy secretary shall act as secretary. If both jobs are vacant, then \u201cthe Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary.\u201d A sitting secretary, moreover, \u201cmay designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.\u201d Currently, DHS\u2019s top ranks are a bit a of ghost town. All three of the top jobs are vacant. Kirstjen Nielsen, the last person to serve as a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security, resigned in April of 2019. Before she left, however, she did lay out the order of succession that should apply if the top three jobs at DHS became vacant. If all top three jobs were vacant, Nielsen determined, then the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency should become secretary \u2014 but this job has been vacant since the spring of 2019. Next in line would be the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \u2014 a job that, until recently, was filled by Christopher Krebs.  Trump fired Krebs in mid-November after Krebs refuted false claims by Trump and some of Trump\u2019s allies that Biden somehow stole the 2020 election. But Krebs still was in his job as head of CISA in July, when Wolf handed down his DACA memo. That means that Krebs, not Wolf, should have been the acting secretary in July. It\u2019s worth noting that, even with Krebs out of the picture, Wolf still is not next in line to be acting secretary. After Krebs is the DHS\u2019s undersecretary for science and technology, but this position is vacant and the job is currently being done by a \u201cSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology.\u201d The next person in line after that is the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis, but that position is vacant as well, and the relevant office is held by an acting official. Eighth in line is the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, but that position is also vacant and there, too, the office is led by an acting official. Ninth in line is the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA actually does have a Senate-confirmed leader \u2014 David Pekoske was confirmed to lead the TSA in 2017 \u2014 and he still holds that office. So it would appear that Pekoske, not Wolf, should currently be serving as acting secretary of DHS. As this litany of vacant offices and acting officials suggests, the courts have thus far been fairly tolerant of President Trump\u2019s attempts to bypass the Senate and fill top jobs with acting officials. But Judge Garaufis\u2019s order suggests that tolerance may be coming to an end just as Biden is preparing to take office. We do not yet know who will control the Senate at the beginning of the Biden administration. Currently, Republicans hold a 50-48 seat majority in the incoming Senate, with two seats to be determined in a January 5 Georgia runoff election.  If Democrats win both of those seats, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote will give them a narrow majority in the Senate. But if Republicans prevail in either Georgia race, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will continue to lead the Senate, and Republicans will have the power to block any Biden nominee to any Senate-confirmed job. Biden, meanwhile, may find himself unable to staff his administration if Republicans choose to sabotage his presidency. While the Department of Homeland Security has a rigid order of succession for its top job, most agencies are governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act   (FVRA) when a Senate-confirmed position becomes vacant.  Under the FVRA, the president may temporarily fill a vacant, Senate-confirmed job with an acting appointee. But the president cannot fill the job with just anyone \u2014 typically the acting appointee must either be currently serving in a Senate-confirmed job, or be currently serving as a senior civil servant. Thus, if a vacancy arises in the middle of a presidency, that\u2019s typically no big deal. After the first year of a new presidency, the president will normally have appointed hundreds of individuals to Senate-confirmed jobs. So that gives the president a deep bench of officials to slide into acting roles as they are needed. But, at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, he won\u2019t be able to rely on existing Senate-confirmed officials to serve as acting secretaries if the Senate refuses to confirm his nominees. With rare exceptions, the only people in Senate-confirmed jobs when Biden takes office will be Trump appointees.  Biden could potentially fill the vacant jobs with civil servants \u2014 that is, with senior career officials in the relevant agencies \u2014 but that could prevent Biden from naming a Cabinet that shares his political and policy vision. The FVRA imposes rigid limits on just how long an individual may serve in an acting role. Under many circumstances, the tenure of an acting official is limited to just 210 days after a vacancy arises. So even though Biden could fill many jobs temporarily with civil servants, many of those acting appointments will expire just seven months into his presidency. As mentioned above, the courts haven\u2019t exactly been rigorous in enforcing these restrictions under President Trump, but they now seem likely to take a new interest in enforcing laws like the FVRA once Biden takes office. A 6-3 Republican Supreme Court is unlikely to bend the law in order to help a Democratic president \u2014 and really, the law is quite clear that Biden does not have a limitless power to make acting appointments. A tremendous amount, in other words, is potentially at stake in the Georgia Senate runoffs. Those races could determine whether the Biden administration is able to perform many of the most basic functions of government \u2014 starting with actually getting people into top jobs within the administration.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s legal team advances yet another far-fetched lawsuit in Georgia President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed yet another lawsuit contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, this time calling for a complete do-over of the election in Georgia. That\u2019s despite two recounts in the state \u2014 overseen by Republican officials \u2014 both indicating Biden\u2019s victory in the state is unambiguous and not going to change. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit, filed in a Georgia state court on Friday, represents the latest of dozens of efforts by his campaign and its allies to contest the legitimacy of vote counts in key states across the nation, all of which have failed to gain traction \u2014 or even be taken seriously by judges \u2014 with the exception of one minor win involving an insignificant number of ballots. But while Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud have no chance at overturning the results of the presidential election, according to legal experts, they continue to shape Republicans\u2019 widespread reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration, potentially setting the stage for even higher levels of polarization in Washington than before.       According to ABC News, Trump\u2019s latest Georgia lawsuit alleges that the state\u2019s election code was \u201cdisregarded, abandoned, ignored, altered, and otherwise violated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca sufficient number of illegal votes\u201d being included in the count. The lawsuit takes issue with rule changes regarding the eligibility of ballots, and includes allegations of fraud \u201cbased on witness affidavits, but with little evidence,\u201d ABC\u2019s Olivia Rubin and Matthew Mosk report. Trump\u2019s team is using these claims to call for \u201ca new Presidential Election to occur at the earliest opportune time.\u201d Georgia is in the midst of its third tally of votes overseen by Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Biden\u2019s margin of victory, while narrow, appears firm. Georgia\u2019s unprecedented hand-count audit confirmed Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, modestly reducing his margin of victory from 13,558 votes to 12,284 votes. And on Friday, preliminary results of a machine recount of the votes indicated that Biden is on track for a similar margin of victory on the third count of the ballots. The day that Trump\u2019s team filed the Georgia lawsuit, they also suffered two more legal defeats. In Nevada, a district judge denied a lawsuit from the Trump campaign contesting the state\u2019s results based on allegations of malfeasance. The judge said the legal team \u201cfailed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence.\u201d And the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear Trump\u2019s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss. Trump and his allies have filed at least 46 lawsuits across the country and their efforts have gone poorly, with even conservative and Trump-appointed judges writing scathing rejections of lawsuits bereft of credible evidence of election official misconduct, incompetence, or fraud. Earlier this week, Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop summarized the state of Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d politicking: \u201cThe lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors.\u201d Trump has called on those state legislative leaders to aid him in stealing the election by appointing electors to the Electoral College who are willing to ignore the results of the election in their states and cast their votes for him rather than for Biden.  As Prokop has explained, this scheme would be difficult to pull off in states in which the GOP isn\u2019t in control of the legislature, courts, and governorship \u2014 and is also one that has been routinely rejected by Republican lawmakers in swing states like Michigan. Only in Pennsylvania have GOP lawmakers endorsed such a plan, and there, their plans appear set to be foiled by the state\u2019s Democratic House and governor. This leaves lawsuits as the president\u2019s only remaining avenue for overturning the election\u2019s results. But these lawsuits have become so transparently filed in bad faith that state and local officials are beginning to call for judges to sanction Trump campaign and Republican lawyers.  Legal experts aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that judges could use financial penalties to deter future lawsuits, since Trump\u2019s legal efforts in many states have involve repeatedly bringing recycled, discredited claims and affidavits to court, a practice that could be deemed abusive. \u201cYou could see a court saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Daniel Weiner, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center election reform program, told ABC News. Despite Biden\u2019s decisive victory in the Electoral College, and the dozens of lawsuits failing to gain any traction, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Washington have declined to question their legitimacy or acknowledge Biden\u2019s status as incoming president.  This week, the Washington Post surveyed every Republican in Congress, and found that fewer than 30 were willing to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. Meanwhile more than 200 Republican members of the House and Senate would \u201csimply not say who won the election.\u201d Trump responded to the results of the Post\u2019s survey with anger, and suggested he wanted to retaliate against the small minority of Republicans who acknowledged he lost the election. \u201cI am surprised there are so many,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS.\u201d RINO is an acronym which stands for \u201cRepublican in name only,\u201d typically used on the right to criticize a Republican for being insufficiently conservative. Trump\u2019s extended legal battles, combined with his weeks-long insistence on Twitter and other platforms that the election was rigged, have also had a strong effect on public opinion.  For example, a mid-November Economist/YouGov poll found that 89 percent of Trump voters believe that voter fraud affected the election outcome, and a majority think it changed the outcome.  While Trump\u2019s legal fights have surfaced no evidence of widespread fraud or misconduct, they have successfully lent credibility to his campaign to convince large swaths of the public that the election was stolen. And that might be their most important legacy.         ",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration extends the freeze on student loan payments through January Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has extended the pause on federal student loan payments due to the coronavirus pandemic through the end of January. The freeze on monthly payments and the accrual of interest on loans had been set to expire at the end of December, but Democrats and consumer advocacy groups had called for an extension, arguing that repayments should not begin again amid the presidential transition and that they should stay suspended, due to uncertainty over when another coronavirus relief bill may be passed by Congress. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,\u201d DeVos said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe added time also allows Congress to do its job and determine what measures it believes are necessary and appropriate. The Congress, not the executive branch, is in charge of student loan policy.\u201d Student loan relief \u2014 which began in March through the CARES Act, and was then extended by the Trump administration \u2014 has provided relief to over 40 million Americans as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, and put a strain on household incomes across the nation. And the economic picture appears unlikely to brighten soon \u2014 more than 5.8 million people are unemployed, and a new federal jobs report found job creation slowing. The student loan freeze has modestly improved credit scores of student loan borrowers and helped borrowers in default avoid penalties for non-payment, such as wage garnishment, according to the Urban Institute. While DeVos called on Congress to take action on relief, both the executive and legislative branches of government have options available for extending relief.  As Politico reports, the coronavirus relief bill passed by House Democrats in May would keep the freeze in place until September 30, 2021, unless the unemployment rate improves. And a bipartisan bill unveiled in the Senate this week potentially offers some kind of relief on payments through March. When President-elect Joe Biden takes office, he will have the option to extend the repayment moratorium through executive action just as the Trump administration did. But Democratic leaders, progressives, and many consumer advocacy groups are pushing for much more sweeping action on loan relief during Biden\u2019s tenure: the outright cancellation of federal student loans.  Some progressives, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have argued that the Higher Education Act gives the education secretary the \u201cauthority to begin to compromise and modify federal student loans,\u201d meaning that the president has the legal power to cancel student loan debt unilaterally.  As Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews has reported, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Warren have called on the Biden administration to use executive authority to forgive the first $50,000 in debt for every borrower with federal student loans. (Federal student loans make up over 92 percent of outstanding student loan balances, as opposed to privately issued loans.) Biden has preferred more modest cancellation measures. He has expressed support for far more limited student loan relief \u2014 forgiving $10,000 per borrower \u2014 but sources involved in his transition planning discussions told the New York Times that he prefers any cancellation measure to be authorized through congressional legislation, not executive action.  If Democrats succeed in taking control of the Senate after Georgia\u2019s two runoff elections \u2014 and therefore hold both chambers of Congress \u2014 there may be some more serious discussion of doing just that. But if Democrats fail to take control of the Senate in January\u2019s runoffs, pressure on Biden to take executive action to forgive loans may intensify.",

    "article_text": "Joe Biden is taking office amid a poverty crisis Poverty actually fell in early to mid-2020, as the pandemic took hold, due to an unprecedented expansion of government safety net programs. But it has since grown and surpassed its early 2020 level, and is poised to increase more if the economic situation remains dire. Those are the major findings from projections made by researchers at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University, who have been developing methods for monthly estimates of poverty during the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers \u2014 Zach Parolin, Chris Wimer, Jane Waldfogel, Jordan Matsudaira, and Megan Curran \u2014 use a metric known as the \u201csupplemental poverty measure,\u201d designed as a more consistent and reliable measure of hardship than the official poverty measure used by US government programs. Their metric is hardly perfect \u2014 critics argue it \u201cdefines poverty down\u201d by setting too low an income threshold \u2014 but it\u2019s useful for tracking variations like those experienced during the Covid-19 crisis.  According to their data, 15.5 percent of Americans, or 50.3 million people, were living in poverty in January 2020, before the coronavirus crisis began in earnest. In April, after relief measures began, the rate was down to 13.9 percent. The crisis continued, but many relief measures did not. The $1,200 \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d (a.k.a. stimulus checks) were a one-off. The $600-per-week boost to unemployment insurance expired at the end of July. And poverty began creeping back up again, reaching 17.3 percent in August, and 16.7 percent, or about 54.2 million people, in September.  In other words, about 4 million more people were in poverty by September than were at the beginning of 2020. That\u2019s a quite large degradation in living standards. Looking ahead to January 2021 requires making some assumptions about unemployment. The rate as of October was 6.9 percent, a swift improvement from the peak of 14.7 percent in April. But it\u2019s still nearly double what it was in February before the crisis. The Columbia researchers\u2019 findings confirm that the January 2021 poverty situation will depend heavily on unemployment. They find that even if unemployment falls to 5 percent, which would be a big improvement, poverty will rise modestly from 16.7 percent in September to 17 percent in January, putting another 1 million or so people in poverty for a total of 55.2 million. If, on the other hand, unemployment remains elevated, the situation gets substantially worse. If it ticks up to 7.5 percent, then poverty will reach 18.1 percent, or 58.8 million people. If the situation deteriorates substantially and unemployment rises to 10 percent again, then poverty will rise to 19.1 percent of Americans \u2014 62.1 million. The upshot is this: Depending on the scale of the broader economic recovery, between 4.9 million and 11.8 million more people will be living in poverty in January 2021 than were in January 2020. This is a large increase even compared to the Great Recession. The same Columbia research group estimates that from 2007 to 2011, poverty measured the same way rose from 14.4 percent to 16.1 percent of the population, a 1.7-point increase. The best-case scenario of 5 percent unemployment in January 2021, by comparison, registers as a 1.5-point increase in poverty, similar in scale to the Great Recession. If we don\u2019t get down to 5 percent unemployment, the effects could be worse than the Great Recession. The Columbia team is not the only group of researchers attempting to track living standards for Americans in poverty on a monthly basis during this crisis. Jeehoon Han of Zhejiang University, Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago, and James X. Sullivan at the University of Notre Dame have their own set of real-time measures, and while they do not calculate projections for January 2021, they tell the same story as the Columbia researchers about what happened from January to October 2020. The poverty rate, as they measure it, fell from 10.9 percent in January/February to 9.4 percent in April/May/June (they average months in an attempt to minimize error). But it then ticked up dramatically, from 9.4 percent to 11.3 percent in September and October. \u201cNearly 7 million have been added to the ranks of the poor since May,\u201d the researchers write in their most recent release. \u201cPoverty appears to have risen in October even though the unemployment rate fell by more than a percentage point.\u201d  That disconnect is partially a temporary result of the expiration of aid programs \u2014 but if it holds, then poverty could rise even more with falling unemployment than the Columbia numbers suggest. One thing to keep in mind when interpreting these two sets of numbers is that the Columbia team defines people and households as \u201cin poverty\u201d if they fall below a certain income threshold (adjusted for cost of living in their area and a few other factors) during a particular month. That has advantages, particularly during a rapidly evolving crisis like this one, but also disadvantages: It only counts tax credits, for instance, as income for the month when a person\u2019s tax refund is delivered. So if a low-income worker got a large earned income tax credit (EITC) in March, that counts as a several-thousand-dollar windfall for just that month \u2014 which helps explain why the Columbia measure sees poverty falling in March, even before Covid-19 relief measures were implemented. The Zhejiang/Chicago/Notre Dame team, by contrast, uses an annual reference period: It is trying to estimate how many people fell below a certain income level in the past 12 months. That gets around problems like the EITC but might make income fluctuations look smaller than they feel: If you lost all your pay in April, that would only show up as an 8 percent fall in your annual income, measured from the previous April. On a monthly basis, though, your income fell 100 percent. Another indication of an increase in that kind of short-run need is the nationwide surge in demand for supplies from food banks. A report from Hunger Free America found that in New York City, food pantries and soup kitchens fed 65.1 percent more people in 2020 than in 2019; that\u2019s compared to a 10 percent increase in people served the year before. The Greater Boston Food Bank told the Boston Globe that it went from distributing 1 million pounds of food per week to 415,000 people pre-pandemic to 2.5 million pounds per week to over 660,000 people.  The St. Louis Area Foodbank in Missouri reports that it went from distributing 3.1 million meals a month pre-pandemic to 5 million meals a month now. In Grand Rapids, the South Michigan Food Bank reported distributing more food in October than it had in any prior month in its 38-year history, covering both the early 1980s recession and the Great Recession. Underlying these trends is an increase in food insecurity, which is closely linked to income poverty. One of the first tasks the Biden administration will face in January is crafting a stimulus package that will pick up where the package that expired at the end of July left off. The expiration of the $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefit appears to have substantially increased need and poverty at the low end, and reviving a bonus benefit and providing other income support policies will be critical for avoiding further increases in poverty and returning the poverty rate to where it was in January 2020, if not lower. President-elect Biden has outlined what his preferred stimulus package would look like in considerable detail. It includes extending the $600-per-week unemployment insurance bonus; extensive aid to state, local, and tribal governments; and a $250-per-child monthly allowance for families, boosted to $300 per month per child for kids under 6. But congressional Democrats have struggled to get a deal matching these parameters through the Republican-controlled Senate, or even a more limited one with, say, $400 per week in bonus UI payments. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on a lower-cost package that includes civil immunity for businesses that put people at risk of Covid-19 infection. McConnell is likely to hold that line if he controls the Senate under Biden; control of the Senate will be determined in two Georgia runoff elections on January 5. The main challenge for policymakers interested in poverty alleviation, then, will be convincing McConnell and his allies to support stimulus and income support at the level that\u2019s needed to reverse the increase in poverty.

    "article_text": "The rise in murders in the US, explained As if the Covid-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t bad enough, America is also seeing a surge in homicides this year. A new report, by the Council on Criminal Justice, found homicides have increased sharply this year across 21 US cities with relevant data: \u201cHomicide rates increased by 42% during the summer and 34% in the fall over the summer and fall of 2019.\u201d Other data, from crime analyst Jeff Asher, found murder is up 36 percent throughout the year so far, compared to the same period in 2019, in a sample of 51 US cities. A preliminary FBI report also found murders up 15 percent nationwide in the first half of 2020. The increase in homicides is large and widespread enough to raise serious alarms for criminologists and other experts. So what\u2019s going on? Some experts have cited the protests this summer over the police killings of George Floyd and others \u2014 which could\u2019ve had a range of effects, from officers pulling back from their duties to greater community distrust in police, leading to more unchecked violence. Others point to the bad economy. Another potential factor is a huge increase in gun purchases this year. Still others posit boredom and social displacement as a result of physical distancing leading people to cause more trouble. Above all, though, experts caution it\u2019s simply been a very unusual year with the Covid-19 pandemic. That makes it difficult to say what, exactly, is happening with crime rates. \u201cThe current year, 2020, is an extreme deviation from baseline \u2014 extreme,\u201d Tracey Meares, founding director at the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, previously told me. That offers a bit of good news: It\u2019s possible that the end of the pandemic will come and homicide rates will fall again, as they generally have for the past few decades in the US. But no one knows for sure if that will happen, or if we\u2019re now seeing a shift in long-term trends. Uncertainty about what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t exactly new in the field of criminal justice. Rates of crime and violence have plummeted over the past few decades in the US, yet there is no agreed-upon explanation for why. There are theories applying the best evidence, research, and data available, ranging from changes in policing to a drop in lead exposure to the rise of video games. But there\u2019s no consensus. That a decades-long phenomenon is still so hard to explain shows the need for humility before jumping to conclusions about the current trends. \u201cWe don\u2019t know nearly enough to know what\u2019s going on at the given moment,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, director of the Justice Tech Lab, previously told me. \u201cThe current moment is so unusual for so many different reasons that \u2026 it\u2019s really hard to speculate about broad phenomena that are driving these trends when we\u2019re not even sure if there\u2019s a trend yet.\u201d All of that said, here\u2019s what we do know. There are several good sources, from criminologists, economists, and other data analysts, for what\u2019s happened with crime and violence so far this year: an analysis by Jeff Asher; a Council on Criminal Justice report written by Richard Rosenfeld and Ernesto Lopez; City Crime Stats, a website from the University of Pennsylvania set up by David Abrams, Priyanka Goonetilleke, Elizabeth Holmdahl, and Kathy Qian; and a preliminary report from the FBI. Crime analyst Jeff Asher offers the most recent data, looking at crime trends in 51 US cities in 2020 so far compared to 2019. He found murders are up 36 percent. Despite previous comments by President Donald Trump blaming the increase on Democrat-run cities, Asher found murders are up about 36 percent in both cities with Democratic mayors and those with Republican mayors. In a smaller sample of US cities, he found violent crime overall is flat and property crimes are down. The Council on Criminal Justice report, updated in November, analyzed crime in 28 US cities, ranging in size from Los Angeles to St. Petersburg, Florida, through October. The authors looked for \u201cstructural breaks,\u201d in which reported crime increased or decreased more than would be expected, based on data from previous years. They found structural breaks in homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault increases, particularly starting in the summer. There weren\u2019t significant increases in domestic assault (although the data for domestic violence is fairly limited), and robbery was actually down. Other kinds of crime, including larceny and drug offenses, largely decreased. Here\u2019s the graph for homicide increases: \u201cThere were 610 more homicides in the 21 cities in the summer and fall of 2020 than during the same period in 2019,\u201d the report found. City Crime Stats\u2019 data complicates matters a bit, comparing the 2020 crime trends in 28 major cities to a five-year baseline. With this approach, the homicide increases don\u2019t seem quite as dramatic in many cities, and other types of crime appear to be mostly down as well. Still, homicides do seem to be significantly up in many of the cities included in the City Crime Stats data set.  Here, for example, is Chicago\u2019s homicide trend, which shows this year\u2019s rate (the red line) rising above the five-year baseline (the gray line and shading) at several points throughout the year: There\u2019s a lot of variation from city to city. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, New York City, and Philadelphia are on the high end of homicides or seeing a flat-out increase. Baltimore, Boston, and Columbus are close to historical trends or actually down. Overall, though, Abrams said that his data suggests there was a significant increase in homicides from May to June: \u201cWe did find a statistically significant increase in homicides \u2014 about 21 percent \u2014 in aggregate in the cities we looked at in the month after versus before those protests,\u201d he previously told me, cautioning we can\u2019t say with any confidence if the protests were the cause. \u201cSame for shootings, but that\u2019s from a smaller number of cities.\u201d A preliminary FBI report confirmed these other reports\u2019 findings for the first half of 2020. It found a 15 percent increase in murders, a 5 percent increase in aggravated assaults, and an 8 percent decrease in property crime nationwide from January through June, compared to the same time period in 2019. The FBI will likely release a report for all of 2020 later in 2021. In Chicago, as well as some other cities, the apparent increase in homicides began before the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. And in some cases, as in Chicago, the spike abruptly ended almost as quickly as it started, only to surge again weeks later, after the protests had calmed. So it\u2019s hard to blame only the protests for a spike \u2014 especially because we know that other factors likely played a role, such as the start of summer, when crime tends to go up, and the end of stay-at-home orders. City-by-city variation isn\u2019t unique to 2020. It\u2019s expected, even when talking about national crime waves or declines, to see some places go up and others go down for different kinds of crime. The US is a big country, and a range of local factors can affect different kinds of crime. Still, there\u2019s enough in the four data sets to draw some conclusions: Homicides are up significantly this year. But other kinds of crime, including violent crime overall, aren\u2019t up and may actually have decreased so far this year. There was also a brief spike in burglaries in major cities starting in late May \u2014 an increase that was so brief and contained to specific cities that experts told me it was almost certainly due to the riots and looting surrounding some Black Lives Matter protests. As Asher noted on Twitter, a disconnect between murders and other crimes would be odd: \u201cViolent crime and murder almost always move in the same direction and they are never this far apart nationally.\u201d One way to reconcile this may be the nature of crime reporting. All of this data is based on reports to governments, typically local police departments. But with people stuck at home, and no government agency operating normally this year, perhaps these reports are just less likely to happen or get picked up, especially lower-level crimes involving drugs or stolen property. At the same time, it\u2019s far harder for a homicide to go completely unreported \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to ignore a dead person. This is why, for much of US history, the homicide rate has been used as a proxy for violent crime overall: The nature of homicide made it a more reliable metric than others for crime. In other words, it\u2019s possible that other kinds of crime are up this year, but they\u2019re simply going unreported. At any rate, homicides are up significantly. One note on domestic violence: Some activists and experts worried it would increase this year as people were forced to stay home more often. The Council on Criminal Justice report and City Crime Stats\u2019 analysis suggest that\u2019s not the case, showing no significant change or a drop in some places. But there\u2019s reason for skepticism: Both sources are pulling data from a limited number of cities. And reporting limitations may especially apply to domestic violence, since this year victims are potentially more likely to be trapped with their abusers and unable to make a phone call for help. There are plenty of caveats to all this data. Much of it only represents trends in large US cities, which means it might not be representative of the country as a whole. And it only covers 2020 through November at the latest. But the trends, particularly with homicides, are very alarming. So why are homicides up? When I posed this question to experts, they again cautioned that no one can say with certainty what\u2019s going on. That said, they offered some possible explanations, based on the limited information we have so far: 1) The pandemic has really messed things up: Looming over absolutely every discussion about 2020 is the Covid-19 pandemic. That\u2019s no different for discussions about crime and violence. This year is very unusual, with many forced to stay at home and living in fear of a new, deadly virus. That could lead to all sorts of unpredictable behaviors that experts don\u2019t understand yet and might take years to explain. 2) Depolicing led to more violence: In response to the 2014 and 2015 waves of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, officers in some cities pulled back, either out of fear that any act of aggressive policing could get them in trouble or in a counterprotest against Black Lives Matter. While protesters have challenged the crime-fighting effectiveness of police, there is a sizable body of evidence that more, and certain kinds of, policing do lead to less crime. Given that, some experts said that depolicing in response to protests could have led to more violence \u2014 what some in years past called the \u201cFerguson effect,\u201d after the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and also seen in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray. 3) Lack of trust in police led to more violence: In response to the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d in 2015, some experts offered a different view of what was happening: Maybe people had lost trust in the police and, as a result, they relied more on street justice and other illegal activities to resolve interpersonal disputes \u2014 an interpretation of \u201clegal cynicism,\u201d explained well in Jill Leovy\u2019s Ghettoside and supported by some empirical research. Perhaps Floyd\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests led to a similar phenomenon this year. 4) More guns led to more gun violence: There\u2019s been a big surge in gun buying this year, seemingly in response to concerns about personal safety during a pandemic. And as the research has shown time and time again, more guns mean more gun violence. A recent, preliminary study from researchers at UC Davis already concluded that gun purchases led to more gun violence than there would be otherwise through May this year. That could have further exacerbated homicide increases. 5) Overwhelmed hospitals led to more deaths: One way to explain a flat or dropping violent crime rate as homicides rise is that the violent crime was deadlier than usual. With health care systems across the US at times close to capacity or at capacity due to Covid-19, maybe hospitals and their staff couldn\u2019t treat violent crime victims as well \u2014 increasing the chances they died this year. That could translate to more deaths, and homicides, even if violent crime remained flat or declined. 6) Idle hands led to more violence: Throughout the pandemic, a lot of people have been bored \u2014 with forms of entertainment, from restaurants to movie theaters, closed down. Schools are limited or closed too, and millions have been newly unemployed. Other support programs that can prevent violence were shuttered due to the closures. All of that could have led to conflict, and possibly more crime and violence. But, experts cautioned, this is speculative, with little evidence so far to support it. 7) A bad economy led to more violence: With the economy tanking this year, some people may have been pushed to desperate acts to make ends meet. Disruptions in the drug market, as product and customers dried up in a bad economy, may have led to more violent competition over what\u2019s left. The bad economy also left local and state governments with less funding for social supports that can keep people out of trouble. All of that, and more, could have contributed to more crime and violence \u2014 but this, too, is still very speculative. Another possibility: None of these explanations is right. With limited data in strange times, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turns out we have no idea what\u2019s going on right now. \u201cWe can bet on it being unpredictable,\u201d Doleac said. Again, there\u2019s still no consensus about what\u2019s caused crime to decline since the 1990s. In that context, it\u2019s no surprise there\u2019s nowhere near a consensus as to why a homicide spike has occurred so far this year. It\u2019s possible that before we understand why it\u2019s happening, the year\u2019s alarming homicide trends could recede. It\u2019s happened before: In 2005 and 2006, the homicide rate briefly increased, only to start declining again before hitting record lows in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the rates also spiked again only to start to dip after. In both instances, these years were effectively blips and the overall crime decline America has seen for the past three decades continued. Maybe after this very weird year ends, crime and violence trends will, similarly, go back to the previous normal. But that\u2019s not a guarantee \u2014 and it\u2019s not something we should rely on, experts said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why crime and violence went down,\u201d John Roman, a criminal justice expert at NORC at the University of Chicago, previously told me. \u201cBeing able to say we should expect this unexplained phenomenon to continue strikes me as sort of irrational.\u201d Even if we can\u2019t explain what may be causing a homicide spike, there are certain strategies that might help fight crime in the short term \u2014 such as deploying police in crime hot spots (though that would have to be done carefully and with reforms, given the current political climate around policing), a \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d program that targets the few people in a community engaging in violence with a mix of support and sanctions, and using civilian \u201cinterrupters\u201d to personally intervene in cases in which violence seems likely to break out. Notably, a lot of this work is done at the local and state level, where the vast majority of police departments are based. The federal government can incentivize certain practices, like President-elect Joe Biden has proposed doing, but it ultimately falls on cities, counties, and states to carry out new or revised approaches. Many of the evidence-based approaches rely on in-person contact, which requires ending the pandemic. \u201cThe police, public health, and community approaches to violence reduction require that people meet face-to-face; they cannot be replaced by Zoom,\u201d Rosenfeld and Lopez wrote in one of their reports. \u201cAn underappreciated consequence of the pandemic is how social-distancing requirements have affected outreach to high-risk individuals.\u201d So the first priority should be to end the pandemic \u2014 ending its potential ripple effects on crime and enabling evidence-based approaches that can help reduce crime. But to do that, the US public and governments will need to truly embrace strategies that have worked for countries like South Korea and Germany against Covid-19: physical distancing, masking, and testing, tracing, and isolating the sick. In this sense, Trump\u2019s failures to address Covid-19 may be leading to more violence. \u201cSeeing what\u2019s happening with these [crime] numbers can point us to or at least get us thinking about what potential policy levers we could employ that would be helpful,\u201d Doleac said. \u201cOtherwise, our attention is probably better focused on making sure we\u2019re all wearing masks.\u201d Beyond the pandemic, police are going to have more trouble fighting crime \u2014 including any current or future spikes \u2014 if large segments of the community don\u2019t trust them. That\u2019s where police reform comes into play. It\u2019s a complicated topic, separate from a possible spike in violence this year. But, in short, experts say police should, at a minimum, show the communities they serve that they understand the concerns, acknowledge mistakes, and will change how officers are trained and deployed. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance that protests against police will flare up, just as they did from 2014 to 2016 and have again this year. If protests lead to more violence \u2014 whether by leading to depolicing, or sowing and exposing distrust in law enforcement \u2014 that\u2019s going to create public safety problems. To put it another way: There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about crime, why it happens, and how to stop it. But it\u2019s going to be much easier to wrap our heads around these issues once things get closer to how they should be \u2014 and that means seriously addressing the pandemic and protests against police brutality. Unfortunately, the US is going in the opposite direction, with a surge of Covid-19 this fall and winter and Trump exacerbating police-community tensions with his rhetoric and push to deploy unsolicited federal agents in some US cities. \u201cHow optimistic should we be for the rest of the summer?\u201d Roman said. \u201cI think the answer is not terribly optimistic, because none of these factors seem to be abating with the return of Covid.\u201d  ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "The battle over Trump\u2019s huge UAE arms deal, explained On Monday evening, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met for a classified briefing with Trump administration officials to hear about a proposed $23 billion weapons sale to the United Arab Emirates. Right when it ended, one of the attendees blasted what had transpired behind closed doors. \u201cJust a mind blowing number of unsettled issues and questions the Administration couldn\u2019t answer,\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. \u201cHard to overstate the danger of rushing this though.\u201d That remark underscored the growing political fight over the arms deal announced in early November, a standoff that could severely impact America\u2019s relations with its authoritarian ally and the military balance in the Middle East.  President Donald Trump wants to sell up to 50 F-35 fighter jets, nearly 20 Reaper drones, and around 14,000 bombs and munitions to the UAE \u2014 and he wants to do it before President-elect Joe Biden enters the Oval Office and potentially scuttles the sale.  The administration has explicitly linked the massive arms package to Trump\u2019s broader efforts to counter Iran and to the UAE\u2019s normalization of relations with Israel in August. \u201cThis is in recognition of our deepening relationship and the UAE\u2019s need for advanced defense capabilities to deter and defend itself against heightened threats from Iran,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing his authorization of the sales. \u201cThe UAE\u2019s historic agreement to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively transform the region\u2019s strategic landscape.\u201d But some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with certain activist groups, oppose the proposed weapons transfer, saying a country responsible for killing civilians in Yemen and funding Russian mercenaries in Libya doesn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded with even better US-made weapons.  \u201cTo sell such advanced military equipment to the UAE now would be to endorse those policies and threaten US interests and regional stability,\u201d said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy, who\u2019s leading an effort by arms control organizations and human rights groups to stop the sale. Which means the next 50 days before Biden takes over will see a nasty tussle over one of Trump\u2019s last major foreign policy initiatives, one he\u2019s trying to ram through before the clock runs out. \u201cThis is happening way too fast,\u201d said Michael Hanna, a Middle East security expert at the Century Foundation in New York City. \u201cProcess is important, substance is important, and neither is good here.\u201d The UAE has long wanted advanced fighter jets and top-of-the-line drones, which would make it a greater, more powerful player in the region \u2014 not just militarily, but politically, too. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going to war here. We\u2019re talking about affecting change in the Middle East,\u201d said Dalia Fahmy, an expert on the UAE\u2019s foreign policy at Long Island University. \u201cThe UAE is reasserting itself in the region. It\u2019s all about being able to leverage that perceived power.\u201d In other words, the UAE wants the world\u2019s most advanced warplane, the F-35, and surveillance and attack drones because it could then throw its weight around in the Middle East. That sounds fine in principle \u2014 after all, most nations seek to increase their power and influence whenever they can. But one big question is how \u2014 and where \u2014 exactly the UAE may try to do that. The sale is \u201cnot helpful [for the US] if there is greater adventurism in Libya or the Horn of Africa,\u201d said a State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to press. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe helpful in a theoretical multilateral framework\u201d against Iran. Both Trump and Biden would certainly rather see the country use the weapons against Iran in case of a war and not, say, to bomb innocent men, women, and children in Yemen, where the UAE is fighting a war as part of a Saudi-led coalition. Figuring out what assurances the US received from the UAE ahead of the sales took up much of Monday\u2019s classified Senate hearing, according to two Senate sources familiar with the discussion.  Murphy\u2019s tweet made clear the answers senators received weren\u2019t satisfactory \u2014 and now he and others are trying to stop the transfers from happening. On November 18, three senators \u2014 Democrats Murphy and Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Robert Menendez, along with Republican Rand Paul \u2014 introduced four joint resolutions to stop the UAE arms deal from happening. \u201cCongress is once again stepping in to serve as a check to avoid putting profit over US national security and that of our allies, and to hopefully prevent a new arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Menendez said in a statement at the time. Those resolutions must be voted on and passed by December 11 or they will expire, clearing Trump\u2019s pathway to the sale. But whether or not the blocking effort works, the resolutions do help make clear the five main arguments against the deal. The first, as mentioned above, is that the UAE could use the weapons indiscriminately, killing civilians in Yemen or elsewhere. Without clear guarantees that that won\u2019t happen, the senators and activists don\u2019t want the measure moving forward. The second concern is that Israel could lose what\u2019s called its \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d (QME) in the Middle East. Simply put, US policy since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war has been to ensure that Israel has more powerful forces than its Arab neighbors. Israel and others fear giving the UAE F-35s and drones might erode that advantage. However, that issue \u201chas receded in importance\u201d more recently, said Barbara Leaf, the US ambassador to the UAE from 2014 to 2018. The main reason is that in October, Israel\u2019s government dropped its objection to the F-35 transfers in particular, soon after the Pentagon promised Jerusalem its edge would remain intact.  \u201cIt\u2019s now more about the foreign policy dimensions of the proposed sale,\u201d Leaf told me. Which brings us to the third objection: that the UAE having this advanced weaponry could change the balance of power in the Middle East, making the Gulf country an even stronger, more influential regional player. If that were the case, experts told me, the UAE might use its newfound strength to attack its enemies, namely Iran, on its own and back other proxies in the area. But some aren\u2019t so worried about that possibility. \u201cThis won\u2019t change the military balance in the Middle East,\u201d said Leaf, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cIran\u2019s missile and nonconventional arsenals are formidable and could wreak immense damage, even if the UAE gets the F-35.\u201d The fourth concern is the potential for an arms race. Basically, if the UAE gets a lot of advanced weapons, others \u2014 like Qatar and Iran, the UAE\u2019s adversaries \u2014 might want them, too. At that point, each country may continue to buy more and more weapons until the region becomes increasingly militarized and dangerous. That\u2019s an outcome many experts hope to avoid, although such a possibility remains far off. The fifth worry is that the Trump administration is ramming through in a matter of months a deal that would normally take years to complete. \u201cThis is definitely being rushed through. That\u2019s abnormal and bad practice,\u201d said the Century Foundation\u2019s Hanna. What normally happens is that a deal is painstakingly worked out between the two parties first, then reviewed closely by the State Department and the Pentagon, and then long-term consultations with Congress begin. One item up for debate would be the Israel issue, for example, which could take years to hash out.  In this case, the Trump administration wants to go from an announcement in November to a sale before January 20, the day Biden is sworn in as president. That\u2019s just unheard of, especially for an arms package of this size. That\u2019s why one Senate aide told me they don\u2019t want to see the deal go through before \u201cthey\u2019ve dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s.\u201d Until then, the backlash against the deal is likely to persist.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden should do everything at once Joe Biden will become the US president during an extraordinary moment in history, one that could very well prove to be the calm before the storm, a brief prelude to dissolution and illiberalism. Trump\u2019s bid to become a full-on authoritarian failed, but Democrats could easily lose the House in a 2022 backlash. Biden could face total congressional opposition, even impeachment \u2014 as the recent baseless \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative has shown, if Republicans don\u2019t have any evidence, they\u2019ll just make something up.  Or maybe Democrats will keep the House and take the Senate in 2022, and legislation will become possible! Who knows? (The Georgia Senate runoffs are another big question mark.) If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past five years, it\u2019s that I definitely don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else does either. What we do know is that Republicans will wage full-on war on Biden from the second he takes office. They will generate fake conspiracies and controversies through right-wing media and social media. Conservative voters will be told again and again that Biden and Kamala Harris are uniquely dangerous traitors engaged in all sorts of elaborate evil plots. The entire conservative movement, from top to bottom, will view limiting Biden to one term as its primary strategic objective. And the movement will engage in misinformation, norm violation, procedural fuckery, and outright lawbreaking, if necessary, to achieve that objective.  The right will be what it is, what it has been becoming for decades now; expecting anything else would be madness. The question is how the Biden administration should behave, knowing all this. It would be foolish for anyone to claim to have all the answers, or any of the answers really, but in my mind the most pointed lesson about how to behave in a hopelessly partisan environment comes from Donald Trump himself. Before getting to that (suspense!), it\u2019s instructive to take a look back at some of the experiences of the administration for which Biden was vice president. When Barack Obama took office in 2009 in a deepening recession, he expected to receive some Republican help bailing out the economy. It\u2019s easy today to look back on that expectation as naive, but at the time it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. The economy was on the brink of disaster, the need was clear, and the depth of conservative backlash was not yet as evident as it would become later.  What happened instead was a wall of opposition from Republicans, built on bad-faith objections about deficit spending and government waste. With so little room to maneuver, Democrats were forced to negotiate with the tiny handful of moderate Republicans and the large handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate, holding the stimulus bill down to their arbitrary spending caps. In the end, the stimulus bill passed with zero Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. The result was an inadequate economic boost and a sluggish recovery that hobbled the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since it was widely agreed that \u201cpolitical capital\u201d was limited and Democrats could only take on one fight at a time, the question then became what to tackle next. The answer proved to be health care reform, perceived as a policy better developed and more widely supported in the Democratic caucus.  In July 2009, Democrats in the House introduced a health care plan based on a system that had been road-tested by Mitt Romney in his recent tenure as governor in Massachusetts. Many Democrats thought the process would take a few months, and then Congress could move on to climate change. Instead, again and again, Republicans lured Democrats into extended negotiations, only to withdraw support at the last minute over some new bad-faith objection (see: \u201cdeath panels\u201d). That left Democrats negotiating with their most conservative members, who did much the same thing (Joe Lieberman, may his name live in infamy). In the end, talks dragged on until March 2010, when Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act. It got no Republican votes, in the Senate or the House.  Then it was finally time for climate change, and the strategy there was yet more clever sequencing. Obama told Republicans that if they didn\u2019t cooperate on climate change legislation, he would regulate greenhouse gases via the Environmental Protection Agency, which would offer less flexibility and less ability to compensate hard-hit communities. The idea was that the threat of EPA regulations \u2014 made inevitable by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA judgment that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to the Clean Air Act \u2014 would frighten Republicans to the legislative table, where they could better defend their interests.  Instead, Republicans vowed implacable opposition to all of it. They would fight furiously against legislation when it was on the table and then fight regulations just as furiously when they came up. To a cool Vulcan mind like Obama\u2019s, it seemed entirely irrational, against Republicans\u2019 own best interests. At that point, he had not fully internalized the extent to which the conservative movement has become unleashed id, driven more by right-wing media than by Republican politicians, fueled by resentment and organized purely to defeat the libs.  In June 2009, when the climate bill passed the House, it got eight Republican votes. By mid-2010, it was dead in the water, with no hope of any Republican votes in the Senate. Democrats no longer had their filibuster-proof 60 seats, and there was nothing like the same support in the caucus that health care reform generated, so it never came to a Senate vote. It ended with a whimper, not a bang. As promised, Obama\u2019s EPA began slowly rolling out regulations, one at a time. It wasn\u2019t until late in his first term that auto mileage standards were finalized and into his second term before EPA got to power plants. Republicans were able to keep Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan tied up in court through the end of his second term. Then Trump took power and began a simultaneous all-fronts assault on Obama\u2019s regulations, unrolling them so fast it was difficult to even keep track. The theme of these stories is that Democrats relied on clever sequencing over and over again, imagining some amount of political capital (\u201ccredibility\u201d) that they could husband and spend strategically to get assistance across the aisle, at every juncture underestimating the ferocity and unanimity of Republican opposition. They kept behaving as though they would find good-faith negotiating partners, as though they were still in the postwar American era of relatively low (or at least manageable) polarization.  What too few of them realized was that they were already in a new era of near-total polarization, with the population sorted into like-minded enclaves, a bifurcated media ecosystem nurturing stacked (and diametrically opposed) \u201cmega-identities,\u201d and voters motivated primarily by \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d which is to say, hatred of the other side.  A fully polarized two-party system really is a zero-sum game. Any victories or gains by one side come at the other side\u2019s expense, even if the victory secures shared goals. The rational course for the party out of power is to fight with full intensity against everything, always, and that\u2019s what Republicans did under Obama. With scarcely any exceptions, from 2010 through 2020, they pushed in every case for maximal partisan advantage, no matter the stakes or possible cost.  The GOP has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a few close calls, but otherwise, its unprincipled pursuit of raw power has paid off handsomely. The party captured state legislatures in 2010 and was able to gerrymander itself minority rule in several states. It practically shut down Congress as a legislative body for six years of Obama\u2019s term. It blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and for its efforts got Neil Gorsuch. It ignored Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dying wishes and for its efforts got a 6-3 conservative Court majority that could last for generations.  Republicans blocked so many Democratic judicial nominations that Senate leader Harry Reid had to get rid of the judicial filibuster to keep the courts staffed. Then, when the GOP took control of the presidency and Senate, it used the absence of the filibuster to pack the federal courts full of hyper-ideological, young, often woefully unqualified judges. Rather than paying any price for total partisan warfare, Republicans were rewarded in 2016 with the presidency and both houses of Congress. After carrying the country to the brink of authoritarian crisis, it has now lost the House and the presidency. But Joe Biden has been left to tackle a virtually uncontrolled pandemic and millions of people out of work and on the verge of homelessness or food insecurity.  The GOP will likely retain control of the Senate, which means there will be no adequate economic recovery package and none of Biden\u2019s ambitious campaign plans will come to fruition. It has kept control of key state legislatures, so it will be able to gerrymander itself an advantage for another decade. The elections of 2022 will be another partisan brawl, and the odds are stacked against Democrats; the president\u2019s party has lost seats in every first-term midterm in the past 100 years, save three. If Republicans gain full control of Congress, impeachment becomes a real possibility, even if conviction is very unlikely. It\u2019s a grim situation, and Biden is starting out behind the eight-ball. How should he proceed? Here we return to the lesson that Trump has to teach Biden about life in hyperpolarized politics.  To wit: blitz. Do everything at once. No matter what the Biden administration does, it will be accused of socialism and corruption by the right. And the past several years have richly demonstrated that conservative parts of the country, particularly rural areas and low-density suburbs, are almost completely captured by right-wing media, from Fox on the TV to AM conservative radio to Sinclair-owned local news to the profusion of shady Facebook sources and groups, where misinformation is rapid and rampant.  Democrats badly need to address this media asymmetry. Despite what conservatives have convinced themselves, mainstream media outlets like CNN are not analogous to Fox, and Democrats have no comparable radio, local TV, or social media operations to carry their messages and narratives straight to voters where they live.  But that is long-term work, and 2022 is right around the corner.  The only thing Biden will have real control over is his administration and what it does. And his North Star, his organizing principle, should be doing as much good on as many fronts as fast as possible. Blitz. By constantly blundering forward, Trump has helped chart which US institutions and norms provide real resistance and which don\u2019t. The courts have tangibly restrained Trump; they have been the primary bulwark against him. But the chattering of the media and the political classes? Moral outrage? Precedent and tradition? Civil protest?  All of these have proven gossamer. Trump charged right through them like they were cotton candy. By constantly acting, being on the offensive, generating new stories and controversies, he simply overwhelmed the ability of the system to fasten on any one thing.  Biden should learn the lesson. All that matters is what gets done, put on paper and into law. The rest is vapor. The administration should staff up as rapidly as possible with ambitious young progressives and tell every single civil servant that the next two years are going to be a full sprint. Start immediately rewriting and reimplementing the environmental, public health, and worker safety regulations Trump has weakened. Reverse his immigration policies. Drop his lawsuits.  Reassess the social cost of carbon. Replace Trump\u2019s weak Affordable Clean Energy rule with more stringent carbon rules for the power sector. Ditch EPA\u2019s \u201csecret science\u201d rule and restock scientific advisory boards with actual scientists. Put a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on public land. Pledge the purchasing power of the federal government \u2014 around $500 billion a year \u2014 toward clean energy technology.  Through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), direct federal financing toward carbon reduction and clean energy across agencies. Use the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reject regulations from any agency that do not include both a climate and equity \u201cscreen\u201d to ensure that they reduce emissions and help the most vulnerable. Use the powers conferred by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill to integrate climate risks into the financial system.  I\u2019ve written more about what Biden can do on climate change without Congress. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews took a wider policy view with 10 big things Biden can do with executive powers, from forgiving student loan debt to reigning in factory farming. More ideas can be found here, here, here, and here, among other places. There\u2019s no shortage of ways for Biden to deploy the powers of the presidency, and he should maximize every one of them. All of these moves will elicit howls of outrage and court challenges from the right. Many will also infuriate the left, since they will inevitably fall short of Biden\u2019s grand campaign promises.  Biden can\u2019t control any of that. Doing less, negotiating more, relying on clever sequencing, chasing after receding promises of cooperation \u2014 none of that will solve anything, any more than it did for Obama. He can reach across the aisle, make it clear his door is open, but he shouldn\u2019t wait around for anyone to walk in. Biden\u2019s best chance is to try to overwhelm the system the way Trump did, by doing so much that it\u2019s impossible to make any one thing into a lasting story. He should launch so many simultaneous reforms that there\u2019s no time for right-wing media to make up lies about all of them or for the Supreme Court to hear them all. He should ignore bad-faith attacks and stay relentlessly on message about what\u2019s gotten done and what\u2019s getting done next. He should, at every juncture, get caught trying to make government work better for ordinary people. To succeed, all this must happen alongside Democratic Party efforts to improve messaging and media, get persistent party infrastructure on the ground in communities the party has neglected, and innovate on voter outreach and persuasion. (Aaron Strauss has some good ideas on that front.) But Biden has something the rest of the party at the federal level does not have: the power to improve Americans\u2019 lives in a visible way. More than anything else, cynicism about government\u2019s ability to do that is corroding US politics. The best thing Biden can do, morally and politically, is act, as much and as fast as possible, and then talk about it, and do more of it, and talk about it more. (And he should be clear about exactly who stands in the way of bigger, better changes, and why his name is Mitch McConnell.) The rest of it, he should ignore: the Washington chatter about the latest Republican accusations or catty infighting among Democratic factions, the cable news story or Twitter drama of the day, the latest offensive thing Trump or some Trump surrogate said, all of it. Bulldoze through it. The president has limited ability to control political discourse and drama, but he has an enormous capacity to change policy and direct resources. Biden should use that power while he has it, without hesitation or apology.",

    "article_text": "4 looming foreign policy crises that could derail Biden\u2019s agenda early on President-elect Joe Biden may want his administration to focus on long-term issues like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, rebuilding alliances, and America\u2019s relationship with China, but some key near-term foreign policy problems will likely require his attention first. After the assassination of its top nuclear scientist by an unknown attacker, Iran might be less willing to engage in diplomacy with America and instead seek revenge by targeting US officials. North Korea could test an intercontinental ballistic missile early in Biden\u2019s term to try to gauge the new administration\u2019s response. The last remaining nuclear arms control deal between the US and Russia is set to expire just over two weeks after Biden takes office. And the reduced number of American troops in Afghanistan could derail sputtering peace talks and worsen the country\u2019s security situation.  Such a dilemma wouldn\u2019t be unique to Biden. Every new president comes in with ideas on how to handle larger global problems, only to have the colloquial \u201ctyranny of the inbox\u201d monopolize their time. \u201cIf you assume that foreign policy is less than half, and maybe a quarter, of the president\u2019s time, then that really shines a light on how serious this inbox problem is,\u201d said Christopher Preble, co-director of the New American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank. Once he\u2019s in the Oval Office, then, Biden will likely find his hopes of tackling grander foreign policy challenges dashed by the effort he\u2019ll have to expend cleaning up more immediate messes. What follows is what four of those messes could look like. The 2015 nuclear agreement among Iran, the US, European powers, Russia, and China put tight restrictions on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The Obama administration\u2019s goal was to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon diplomatically instead of by military force. But President Donald Trump withdrew America from the deal in 2018, reimposed financial penalties on Iran, and asked European countries to cease their business with the country. That kicked off a years-long cycle of escalations that, among other things, has seen Iran stockpile 12 times the amount of low-enriched uranium the deal allowed and the assassinations of two prominent Iranian officials. The first took place in January, when the US killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s paramilitary forces and one of the most powerful men in the country. Iran promised to exact a \u201charsher revenge\u201d in response; so far, that revenge has consisted mostly of attacks on US forces and assets by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.  The second killing happened last Friday, when the mastermind behind Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was fatally shot inside his vehicle near Tehran, reportedly with a remote-controlled weapon. No one has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israel has been suspected of orchestrating similar assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in the past. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has already blamed Israel for it \u2014 and added his own threat. \u201cIran will surely respond to the martyrdom of our scientist at the proper time,\u201d he said in a Saturday speech. If Iran were to respond to these assassinations by escalating attacks on US personnel in Iraq or by attempting to assassinate US or Israeli officials, it would pose a major challenge for a Biden administration.  \u201cCertainly a retaliation that led to the killing of an American in a theater like Iraq would create serious complications for the Biden team,\u201d said Dalia Dassa Kaye, a Middle East expert at the RAND Corporation. The president-elect has often stated that America\u2019s commitment to Israel will remain \u201cironclad\u201d under his presidency. If Iran were to directly or even indirectly attack Israel, Biden would be under a lot of pressure to support Jerusalem in some way.  All of this, of course, would lead the US and Iran further down the path toward war and away from a possible diplomatic resolution. \u201cSuch responses are likely to undermine the chances for diplomacy with Biden and easing of US sanctions,\u201d Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me.  However, Iran could use the threat of an attack as a pressure tool, she continued. \u201cIran could instead hold back its retaliatory moves \u2014 maintaining it will respond at a time and place of its choosing. This way Iran has some more bargaining chips when it comes to potential future talks with the Biden administration and Europeans.\u201d What Iran does or doesn\u2019t do in the coming months, then, could greatly impact Biden\u2019s grander foreign policy plans. As the oft-quoted saying goes: \u201cThe enemy gets a vote.\u201d Within the first few months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, North Korea tested a long-range missile and a nuclear device. And in Trump\u2019s first year in charge, Pyongyang test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and tested its most powerful nuclear bomb to date. Some experts warn that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may make similar provocative moves in the early stages of a Biden administration. \u201cNorth Korea is one of those challenges that no one really wants to deal with right now, since there are no easy solutions or pathways to slowing down the growth of the program. But Kim has a way of putting himself back on the high-priority list,\u201d said Vipin Narang, an expert on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at MIT. There are many ways Kim could do that, but one in particular stands out: He could conduct the first test of the new ICBMs he displayed during an October parade.  Those missiles were not only the biggest ever seen in North Korea\u2019s arsenal, experts also said they were the largest road-mobile missiles with their own truck-based launchers in the world. In case of a war, then, North Korea\u2019s military could roll these missiles out of underground bunkers, place them somewhere on land, and shoot them at the United States.  A test simulating that kind of launch would rank among the most threatening actions ever taken by Pyongyang \u2014 surely ratcheting up tensions with the US in the process. The new missiles haven\u2019t been tested yet, though, and they may have issues North Korea still needs to fix.  That\u2019s why many experts predict Pyongyang will probably test one in early 2021, in part to see how it goes and in part to send a message to Biden: North Korea is a nuclear power, and you can\u2019t do anything about it. Such a provocative move would require some sort of response from the Biden administration. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean war, said Elizabeth Saunders, a US foreign policy expert at Georgetown University. But it could mean more sanctions on North Korea, reinstating US military drills with South Korea, sending more US warships to the area, or all of the above.  Figuring out the best response could take up a lot of time and energy early in Biden\u2019s term, leaving less time and energy to address some of his longer-term policy objectives. New START, short for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is a nuclear arms control agreement signed between the US and Russia in 2011. The pact limits the size of the two countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals, which together account for 93 percent of all nuclear warheads on earth. The problem is that the deal \u2014 the last major arms control accord between Washington and Moscow still in effect \u2014 is set to expire on February 5, 2021. That gives Biden just 16 days after becoming president to extend the pact. Biden has committed to extending New START, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to extend it for at least one year. Most experts believe Biden and Putin will swiftly extend the agreement before the deadline. \u201cMy impression is that Russia still regards an extension of New START as being in their interest,\u201d said Sarah Bidgood, an expert on Russia\u2019s nuclear program at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies.  But the short timeline could give Moscow an advantage to extract some early concessions from the Biden administration before greenlighting an extension. The Kremlin, experts say, could demand Biden lift Trump-imposed sanctions on the country, or ask that the US make a statement praising Russia\u2019s military presence in Nagorno-Karabakh to keep the peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It\u2019s unclear if such requests would truly be of the take-it-or-leave-it variety. Moscow might want to see what it could get, if anything, before agreeing to an extension. Still, such a move could take the US and Russia to the brink of losing New START and decades of arms control efforts along with it. What\u2019s more, Bidgood said, a tough negotiation could follow after the extension, especially if Washington and Moscow don\u2019t prolong New START for the full five years allowed under the deal. The potential for nuclear-related trouble with Russia right at the start of a new administration, then, could be a time suck for the Biden administration. With just two months left in office, the Trump administration is rushing to wind down the 19-year US war in Afghanistan by cutting the number of US troops in the country from 4,500 to 2,500 by January 15 \u2014 five days before Biden is to be sworn in. But while many on both the left and the right in the US support bringing that war to an end, experts worry such a quick withdrawal will harm America\u2019s interests in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a less responsible way to withdraw,\u201d Jason Dempsey, a former Army infantry officer who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, told me earlier this month. The main concern is what leaving so abruptly means for America\u2019s diplomatic pact with the Taliban. The deal both parties signed earlier this year said all US troops had to leave by May 2021, assuming conditions in the country are relatively peaceful and the Taliban has upheld its end of the deal, which includes engaging in peace talks with the Afghan government and not attacking international forces. Those peace talks began in September but are not going very well \u2014 not least because Taliban fighters have increased their attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians across the country in recent months. Dempsey, who\u2019s now at the Center for a New American Security think tank, said pulling more US troops out of the country as those negotiations proceed could hurt Kabul\u2019s negotiating position and encourage even more Taliban attacks. \u201cGiving away any leverage you have as you leave is a pretty stupid way to go about it,\u201d he told me. The question is what Biden would do with the forces Trump plans to leave him with. The president-elect has said he wants to keep at least some troops in Afghanistan to serve as a counterterrorism force, so it\u2019s possible he may not change anything when he takes office in January. But if the smaller US presence emboldens the Taliban to ask for more in diplomatic talks with the Afghan government, or even attempt a forcible takeover of the Afghan government \u2014 as it did in 1996 \u2014 then the Biden administration might have to scramble to back its ally in Kabul. That could potentially lead the new president to escalate the war in the country, thereby turning much of his time and attention away from other projects to focus on an old one.       ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden announces Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary pick In 2014, Janet Yellen became the first woman to be named chair of the Federal Reserve. Six years later, she is poised to become the first woman Treasury secretary of the United States. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden announced that he intends to nominate Yellen, 74, to head the Treasury Department; he also announced his picks for a number of other key members of his economic team. The Yellen choice was widely reported last week. Biden\u2019s pick is not necessarily a surprising one. In the days leading up to the decision, Biden said his nominee would be someone who \u201cwill be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party \u2026 progressive to the moderate coalitions,\u201d leading to broad speculation that it would be Yellen, who most Democrats are expected to support and who many Republicans could have a hard time opposing. In a tweet on Monday \u2014 her first \u2014 Yellen said the country faces \u201cgreat challenges\u201d at the moment. \u201cTo recover, we must restore the American dream \u2014 a society where each person can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs Treasury Secretary, I will work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all.\u201d Yellen, who is originally from Brooklyn, New York, served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 before President Donald Trump decided to replace her with current Chair Jerome Powell. She previously served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, and was a longtime professor at the University of California Berkeley. \u201cYellen is eminently qualified, she oversaw a sprawling bureaucracy at the Fed. It would be incredibly difficult for various factions [Republicans, moderate Democrats, and progressive Democrats] to find issue with her tenure,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research and Trading. \u201cI don\u2019t think she would make any side happy, per se, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t make either side unhappy, and that might be as good as we can get.\u201d As Fed chair, Yellen oversaw the continued recovery from the Great Recession and left behind a solid legacy. Unemployment declined steadily, the stock market climbed, and inflation stayed low under her tenure. Part of the strong economy Trump inherited can be traced back to Yellen. That\u2019s not to say Yellen\u2019s time at the Fed was perfect. As Sam Bell outlined in Politico in 2018, some people say that she was \u201ctoo sanguine\u201d about the potential for using regulations to stave off the next financial crisis, that she went too easy on Wells Fargo in the wake of its fake accounts scandal, or that she didn\u2019t do enough to help smaller banks. \u201cAnd yet on the critical issue at hand in her 2014 nomination \u2014 could we bring more unemployed workers back into the labor force without blowing things up for everyone? \u2014 she has been unquestionably vindicated,\u201d Bell wrote. Some people have also questioned the Fed\u2019s decision to modestly raise interest rates under Yellen\u2019s tenure, arguing that doing so prevented the economy from reaching its full potential and getting more people into the workforce. Of course, hindsight is 20/20. And at the Treasury Department, Yellen won\u2019t have anything to do with interest rate decisions. \u201cJust as she shied away from fiscal policy when she ran monetary policy, I think she\u2019d shy away from monetary policy as Treasury secretary,\u201d Boltansky said. Progressives have also raised questions about her previous comments regarding the deficit, which she described as unsustainable.  Biden also revealed a number of other nominees for his economic team on Monday, including Center for American Progress president and CEO Neera Tanden for director of the Office of Management and Budget, labor economist and Princeton School of Public and International Affairs dean Cecilia Rouse for chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Obama Foundation president Wally Adeyemo for deputy Treasury secretary. Biden said he will appoint his longtime adviser Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, to serve on the Council of Economic Advisers. Other contenders on the shortlist for the Treasury spot included former Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin; current Fed governor Lael Brainard; and Roger Ferguson, the CEO of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a financial services company, among others. Heading the Treasury Department is an important job \u2014 the department oversees the IRS; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which charters, regulates, and supervises national banks; and the US Mint, among other bureaus \u2014 and the secretary plays a key role in advising the president on economic issues.  Leading up to Biden\u2019s announcement, there was quite a bit of back-and-forth among more moderate and progressive Democrats regarding who the Treasury pick should be. Progressives championed figures such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Raskin, and pushed Biden to eschew anyone with perceived industry or Wall Street ties. Moderates, on the other hand, hoped for a figure viewed as less divisive than Warren, more along the lines of Ferguson or Brainard. But it is important to remember that the person chosen to run the Treasury Department reflects the Biden administration\u2019s priorities, not the other way around, and will likely be in lockstep with the White House\u2019s positioning on key issues. \u201cThe Treasury secretary and Biden will, at least publicly, be on the same page and deliver the same message,\u201d wrote Ian Katz, director at Capital Alpha Partners, in a recent note to investors. \u201cYou will not see Biden, for example, criticizing sanctions against other countries that the Treasury Department is working on.\u201d At least initially, that will mean the new secretary will work with Biden on his top priority: addressing the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to remake Treasury in their own image, Treasury will still be forced to triage, as every agency will, in fighting the virus,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in that role, they\u2019re going to be a virus-fighter first and a treasury secretary second.\u201d This could translate to the secretary trying to negotiate a new stimulus package with Congress, as current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has done, to little success, under Trump. It could also mean an effort to refocus the department on renewing CARES Act programs, like restarting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for small businesses. Mnuchin recently decided to end lending programs put in place through the CARES Act, and asked the Fed to return funds earmarked for those programs. Biden\u2019s team has been critical of the move. If those programs are restarted under the Biden administration \u2014 something that will become tougher if the funds are returned before Inauguration Day \u2014 the new secretary could oversee those as well.  Biden has also emphasized the importance of reasserting America\u2019s presence on the international stage, and Treasury has a role to play there. One can expect more attention to the international arena from a Biden Treasury Department than from Trump\u2019s, and an effort to reaffirm international relationships. It\u2019s possible, too, that the Treasury secretary (or other members of the administration) could wind up playing multiple roles through the Vacancies Act, should Biden struggle to get his choices through the Senate confirmation process. Trump employed this strategy often, like when then-White House budget director Mick Mulvaney was acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If confirmed, Yellen will find herself in one of the most powerful governmental positions within the American economy yet again, though in a different role. And she is expected to be particularly influential in the role. \u201cThough all of the contenders [for Biden\u2019s Treasury pick] would have Biden\u2019s ear, we think Yellen\u2019s voice would carry the most weight with the president and his advisers,\u201d Katz wrote. \u201cNot many people in the White House would want to debate economics with Yellen.\u201d",

    "article_text": "What happened to Democrats in North Carolina: \u201cIt was a total effort that failed down ballot\u201d North Carolina Democrats and progressive organizers this year had hoped for a repeat of the 2008 election, when Democrats won in the state up and down the ballot. Instead, they saw several victories for Republicans. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the presidency,\u201d said Robert Dawkins, the political director of Action NC, an advocacy group focused on anti-poverty initiatives and voter outreach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t gain any progressive seats in the House, state Senate; most of the black candidates that ran for judges didn\u2019t win. It was a total effort that failed down ballot.\u201d Ahead of Election Day, polls projected positive results for Democrats in North Carolina \u2014 on November 3, President-elect Joe Biden led President Donald Trump in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s state polling average by 1.8 percentage points, Democratic US Senate candidate Cal Cunningham led incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis by anywhere from 2 to 6 percentage points, and incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was regularly recorded as having double-digit support. Of the three, only Cooper won, and by 4.52 percentage points. Biden lost by 1.34 percentage points, Cunningham by 1.74 percentage points, and Republicans maintained control of the state legislature. The losses for Democrats weren\u2019t due to low turnout; in fact, turnout was up, with 75 percent of eligible voters \u2014 5.54 million people \u2014 casting ballots. According to the North Carolina state board of elections, Democrats expanded their voter base by nearly 500,000 compared to 2016, while Republicans gained about 400,000 more voters. And a Carolina Population Center analysis found about 1.8 million new voters (Democratic, Republican, and unaffiliated) registered compared to 2016. There was expanded access to polling sites, with early voting locations being added in cities and efforts to facilitate transportation for those lacking it on Election Day. A number of activists told me there were fewer instances of outright voter suppression than had been feared, and that wait times to cast ballots generally weren\u2019t long.  None of that was enough, however. Many I spoke to in the state said they believe the results showed the problem was not about enthusiasm or turnout, but about strategy, difficulty overcoming the consequences of past elections, and, most importantly, timing.  Unlike North Carolina, Biden was able to win in Georgia, defeating Trump by 0.25 percentage points. According to activists and organizers in North Carolina, the difference between the two states was at least partly self-inflicted. Take Democrats\u2019 outreach strategy in each state: Dawkins said Georgia deftly implemented a policy-centric approach that could have been employed more effectively in North Carolina. \u201cIn Georgia, from the start of the new year in January, everything, every campaign, if they were talking about why a neighborhood needs a speed bump, it was, \u2018It\u2019s not going to change until you register to vote. And here\u2019s a card, register to vote,\u2019\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cIt was surgical.\u201d A similar strategy led to Democrats\u2019 last big win in North Carolina in 2008, according to Dawkins. That year, the Democratic Party won the presidency, a US Senate race, the governor\u2019s chair, and maintained control of the state\u2019s General Assembly.  Dawkins said that year, \u201cI don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about a pothole, or I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about the light rail here, or whatever it was, got tied to, \u2018And we need to vote to get this man in office.\u2019\u201d That year, Barack Obama was on the ballot, and this method of winning votes was made easier by the enthusiasm created by his candidacy. This time, voters weren\u2019t quite as animated by their choices.  Ahead of the election, Kevin Jones, the first vice chair of the Nash County Democratic Party, told me he was concerned about the level of enthusiasm for the Democrats on the ballot, particularly Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf Donald Trump needs 15 electoral votes to win the presidency and it comes down to one vote in North Carolina, it won\u2019t be my vote that gets him in there. But, you know, I don\u2019t feel too good about it.\u201d But there remains a sense that a different strategy could have overcome that gap. Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Georgia this year either, and the state nevertheless flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bennett Carpenter, the lead organizer for the progressive political group Durham for All, said his organization worked to highlight how Democratic policies would help voters \u2014 and saw success with it.  \u201cPeople are so clear, especially in this moment, on the issues facing our communities, they\u2019re loud and obvious,\u201d Carpenter said. Acknowledging that many in their community are frustrated with a lack of progress on those issues, Carpenter added that Durham for All saw success in \u201csharing messaging around, \u2018We can make change happen, we can work together\u2019 ... it\u2019s a bridge to bring people over kind of the arc from disillusionment to hope and possibility.\u201d  But Dawkins believes it should have been executed more broadly. Marcus Bass, the executive director of Advance Carolina, a progressive advocacy group focused on empowering Black communities, said he saw the problem as coming from the top. He believes that the national Democratic Party\u2019s \u201coffering of the Trump-or-else ticket, without really providing a deep response to some of these longstanding issues, hurt the efforts of turnout in North Carolina.\u201d  And Todd Zimmer, co-director of the rural progressive advocacy group Down Home North Carolina, noted that Democrats\u2019 single statewide success, the reelection of Gov. Roy Cooper, can be seen as a testament to the effectiveness of a policy-centric approach.  \u201cCooper has shown that he will fight for Medicaid expansion, that he\u2019ll stand up, even if he can\u2019t win that fight with a divided General Assembly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think he was rewarded by North Carolina voters because he\u2019s seen as someone who understands how important that issue is ... [and] his response also surely helped. Because North Carolinians approve of his handling of the coronavirus and oppose the reopen movement, by and large.\u201d A number of organizers also said Democrats hurt themselves. Organizers in many swing states have complained post-election that the Democratic Party relied too heavily on consultants and operatives from outside their states \u2014 and I heard similar lamentations about the national party\u2019s strategy in North Carolina.  Bass argued party leaders miscalculated in hoping the top of the ticket would buoy down-ballot candidates. And while national leaders were generally given credit for investing in the state, North Carolina organizers said that money was often not used wisely and that staff and consultants arrived too late in the year, with too little understanding of the communities they\u2019d been embedded in to do much good.  The issue, they said, and as Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo told Politico, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t just show up a month before the election and expect people to be excited to vote for you.\u201d  Perhaps the most important issue was one of time, according to many organizers. They said flipping North Carolina can and will happen, once they\u2019ve had a few more years to do so. Durham for All was limited in part by being a relatively new organization, Carpenter said \u2014 it was founded only four years ago. Down Home North Carolina is about three years old. And many of the progressive organizations they partner with are around the same age or newer. \u201cIn the places where we\u2019re really building that infrastructure, I think we\u2019re seeing real gains,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cA lesson to me is that that infrastructure takes time and resources and permanent year-round work.\u201d Carpenter said the hope is that in four years, with continued work and engagement, the results of North Carolina\u2019s elections will be radically different. And in Georgia, organizers told me that time \u2014 coupled with consistent work \u2014 was the secret to their success. Deborah Scott, the executive director of Georgia Stand-Up told Vox\u2019s Anna North that turning Georgia blue was a 15-year effort.  As Lewanna Heard-Tucker, chair of Georgia\u2019s Fulton County Democrats, told me, \u201cAt the end of the day, this has been a long time coming for Georgia. It didn\u2019t just happen overnight.\u201d While there are certainly opportunities Democrats and organizers can continue to pursue, their efforts were also complicated by factors outside of their control. Chief among these was the coronavirus pandemic, which forced organizers and party officials to scrap their plans for registration and motivation and to hastily come up with new strategies.  \u201cRight when we started [outreach efforts] Covid hit, which threw a wrench in some of our plans, particularly because our initial plan had been really focused on door-knocking as the way that you can really meet people where they\u2019re at and build relationships,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cAnd so right from jump, we had to really switch to primarily phone-banking and text-banking and from in-person events to virtual.\u201d For Durham for All, those efforts were more effective than they might have hoped. And Bass noted that while the pandemic made organizing difficult, it allowed Advance Carolina to engage in ways it might not otherwise have been able to. \u201cTaking us out of physical spaces,\u201d said Bass, \u201chelped build a broader base, in some cases, where groups that typically would just be meeting in private spaces now are online.\u201d But for other organizations, the transition was more difficult. Zimmer said Down Home North Carolina moved to a \u201crelational turnout model\u201d where about 800 leaders were given access to an app to help support them in outreach to friends, family, and others they had personal relationships with. The organization also moved an outreach strategy based around conversations on race and class it had planned to use in person to the phones.  \u201cI think that was to our disadvantage, frankly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think that those tactics are powerful and strong, but that doors is a really important part of our electoral process. And so I wish we could have a do-over and could be on doors.\u201d And Dawkins noted that many other organizations struggled as they \u201cdrastically moved off of a tried-and-true and proven method of door contact and phone-banking and switched over to more mobile mobilization work, which I don\u2019t think paid off.\u201d Much of that mobile mobilization work consisted of \u201cwhat we call souls to the polls,\u201d Dawkins said \u2014 meaning organizations worked with pastors and other community leaders to put together marches to polling places. \u201cThat drastically hurt,\u201d Dawkins told me, \u201cbecause what you found was the people that were showing up and taking part in these marches to the polls and souls to the polls were people that were already gonna vote.\u201d Because of pandemic- and funding-related challenges, Action NC was ultimately not able to match its normal level of voter engagement. \u201cNormally we shoot to register between 15,000 and 20,000 people a year. This year, we reregistered 6,500. So that was a big hit,\u201d Dawkins said. Still, statewide, registration was up, buoyed in part by the state\u2019s nearly 400,000 new residents since 2016. Turnout increased dramatically as well. In the rural communities Down Home North Carolina serves, Zimmer said, \u201cin a lot of cases [there was] an over 100 percent increase versus \u201916.\u201d Overall, Carpenter said, \u201cWe brought 100,000 more folks into the races than the right wing did, which meant that when it comes to statewide races, we were able to really narrow the gap \u2014 but still not close it.\u201d Closing that gap was complicated in part by the past. While Democrats won resoundingly in 2008, they lost badly in 2010, when Republicans took control of the North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly. These lawmakers oversaw redistricting after the 2010 census, redrawing maps to benefit the GOP \u2014 first along racial lines and then along partisan lines after their initial effort was invalidated by the US Supreme Court for diluting the voting power of Black North Carolinians. In 2012, a Republican governor won, giving the GOP complete control of the state. New voting constraints, including a voter ID law, followed in 2013. These were struck down in 2016 by the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals for targeting \u201cAfrican Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d A modified version of the voter ID law was then instated via ballot measure in 2018. It\u2019s currently being fought in court \u2014 and as a result, was not in effect for the 2020 election. Nevertheless, this reality made it feel as though Democrats and organizers for progressive causes were playing against a stacked deck, their voting power diluted and many citizens unsure of whether they had the documents needed to vote. Carpenter said it \u201cfor sure\u201d hurt Democrats in the most recent election.  Many organizers, like Carpenter, see the 2020 election as the catalyst for greater change in the state and the start of years of organizing work and court battles in order to make North Carolina more competitive for Democrats. Legal challenges to the state\u2019s voter ID law are set to continue in state and federal court \u2014 and advocates hope to lobby for greater access to voter registration. For example, online voter registration was made available this cycle for North Carolinians with driver\u2019s licenses, a policy change Carpenter called \u201can improvement that still didn\u2019t fully address the structural barriers that prevent particularly people of color, poor working-class people, and young people from registering and voting.\u201d Expanding that access would make registering new voters easier ahead of the 2022 races. Carpenter also spoke of working to expand Democrats\u2019 voter base. Biden was clearly able to grow his base of support in historically Democratic counties but struggled more to flip back Obama-voting counties Trump won in 2016. In many of those, Trump built upon his 2016 vote totals; for example, in Robeson County, which Trump swung by 21 percentage points in 2016, he beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 percentage points. In 2020, he defeated Biden there by 18.6 percentage points. \u201cIf I have a takeaway from this election, it\u2019s that we need to continue to do work to persuade people who might be voting for Trump that actually, our politics offers them a better path towards a more hopeful and prosperous and happier future,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think we need to have the audacity to believe that our vision can be more powerful and more compelling than the siren call of white supremacy.\u201d Perhaps the most immediately pressing issue for organizers and Democrats will be the fact that the GOP will retain control of the General Assembly.  When the new districts are drawn following the release of the 2020 census results, Republican lawmakers are likely to attempt to neutralize Democratic power in places where Biden significantly increased his vote share over Clinton, like Wake County, and to minimize the role new Democratic state residents have on elections. Dawkins said he and other activists expect to \u201cgo back to court and fight over that.\u201d  That means in the short term, organizers and local Democratic officials need to play where they can win, Carpenter said, adding that the key question is, \u201cHow can we actually be mobilizing for real change in the places where we do have decisive governing power as we\u2019re continuing to build that grassroots infrastructure at the local level?\u201d And in the long term, Zimmer said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations happening in some of the spaces I\u2019m in right now about 10-year strategies because there\u2019s a sense that North Carolina will change but that we have to organize and build strategically in order to get there.\u201d For many I spoke to, that strategic building will involve outreach, education, pooling resources with like-minded organizations, and the careful recruitment of candidates that reflect the communities they are running in and that have a nuanced grasp of policy.  The ultimate goal, Carpenter said, is to be in a position \u201cfour years from now, eight years from now, where we\u2019re continuing to grow the movement, grow the leaders, grow the infrastructure that can not just win one election, but actually continue to win real change for North Carolina.\u201d ",

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he would not vote to confirm Becerra, and pro-life\u00a0group Susan B. Anthony List urged other Republican senators to \"stop this unacceptable nomination from going forward.\" BIDEN PICKS HEALTH TEAM, INCLUDING BECERRA FOR HHS SECRETARY, FAUCI AS TOP CORONAVIRUS ADVISER \"Xavier Becerra spent his career attacking pro-life Americans and tried to force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise abortions,\" Cotton wrote on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0\"He's been a disaster in California and he is unqualified to lead HHS.

Anthony List wrote on Twitter, adding that the former California congressman\u00a0has voted against banning partial-birth abortions. Alliance Defending Freedom's Kristen Waggoner echoed Susan B. Anthony List's \"extremist\" label. \"ADF had to go all the way to the Supreme Court to stop Becerra from forcing religious pro-life pregnancy centers to advertise for abortions. He is an extremist who has no regard for conscience or protecting life. There\u2019s nothing moderate about this pick. Nothing,\" Waggoner wrote on Twitter. Choosing Becerra shows that a Biden administration will be anything but \"moderate,\"\u00a0Southern Baptist Theological Seminary president Al Mohler concurred. \"Biden\u2019s choice of Xavier Becerra as HHS Secretary shows the abject lie of the 'moderate'\u00a0Biden and sets up a fight the Republicans in the Senate had better not lose. Conservatives in Georgia\u2014are you paying attention? All eyes are on you. Voter registration ends Monday!\" Mohler wrote on Twitter. The balance of power in the Senate hangs on the Georgia runoff elections, so it remains to be seen whether Republicans will be able to block Becerra's confirmation. To be HHS secretray, Becerra would have to cut short\u00a0his term as\u00a0state\u00a0attorney general, which lasts\u00a0until January 2023.

Tanden, a Hillary Clinton loyalist and CEO of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, has drawn ire from conservative Republicans\u00a0and progressive Democrats alike. Her confirmation may hang\u00a0on the outcome of Georgia's Senate runoff elections in January, which will determine which party gets control of the upper chamber. TULSI GABBARD URGES SENATE TO VOTE 'NO' ON THIS BIDEN CABINET PICK \"Like me, [Tanden] was raised by a single mother and knows firsthand the importance of having an economy that treats all people with dignity and respect,\"\u00a0Harris tweeted Friday.\u00a0\"I know with her at the helm of the Office of Management and Budget, our budget will fully reflect our values.\" Her tweet came in response to a video Tanden posted to Twitter in which she told how she was raised by a single mother, and how her family depended on welfare to succeed.

Our government must invest in people to put an end to this worry, and revive our economy.\" Biden also defended Tanden in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Freidman published Wednesday, suggesting that Republican criticism of his pick -- because of her \"trail of nasty tweets\" -- is hypocritical.

Zients will be tasked with overseeing the rollout of the vaccine and mobilizing economic aid, among other priorities.\u00a0 Under President Obama, Zients served as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0 Democratic consulting firm Saguaro Strategies scrubbed the page over the summer and fall as Zients\u2019 profile rose after he joined the Biden transition team. The firm made the changes using the name \u201cSaguarostrat,\u201d with the intent to clean up anything that could be politically damaging. A Saguaro Strategies staffer confirmed to Politico that the Wikipedia account was linked to the firm. After Politico reached out, the username was changed to Cactus78910. BIDEN URGES TAKING CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, WEARING MASKS BUT SAYS THEY SHOULDN'T BE MANDATORY One chief executive on former President Obama\u2019s jobs council remarked that he thought Zients, then a top Obama aide, was a Republican, his Wiki page used to read. The section has been deleted.\u00a0 Politico reports that one section -- where Zients spoke highly of the management consulting firm Bain -- was removed\u00a0but as of this writing it has returned. Zients reportedly \"fell in love with Bain's culture, teamwork \u2026 and analytical rigor,\u201d the section reads.\u00a0 TULSI GABBARD URGES SENATE TO VOTE 'NO' ON THIS CABINET PICK The firm also added that Zients left Facebook over \u00a0\u201cover differences with company leadership over governance and its policies around political discourse.\u201d\u00a0Zients has never said that publicly. At the top of the section about Zients\u2019 role advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has seen left-wing opposition, the firm added Zients\u2019 argument that it was \u201cthe most progressive trade agreement there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u00a0 As of this writing, that section has been removed. Zients\u2019 promotion of the TPP quotes him as saying: \u00a0\"[t]hink of TPP as tax cuts \u2026 it cuts tariffs and sweeps away barriers to trade.\u201d A sudden scrubbing of someone\u2019s Wikipedia page is not uncommon for individuals angling for a high-profile post. In June, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019 Wikipedia page was scrubbed more than any other vice presidential contender and the majority of edits were made by a single person, The Intercept reported.\u00a0 WestExec Advisors\u00a0removed mention of its China-related work from its website just before Biden became the nominee.\u00a0 Several of Biden\u2019s cabinet picks have worked for the firm, including its co-founder, Anthony Blinken, who is the nominee for secretary of state, and a former WestExec principal, Avril Haines, who is the nominee for director of national intelligence. Web archives\u00a0show that as recently as late July, the firm was touting its success in helping U.S. research universities accept donations from China, expand foreign research collaboration, and welcome foreign students in key STEM programs while remaining a \u201ctrusted partner for (Department of Defense) -sponsored research grants.\u201d In early August, the firm said it had helped a leading American pharmaceutical company and a multibillion-dollar American technology company gain market access to China.

Period. End of story,'\" Tapper began the exchange. \"Will your brothers, will your son take leave from any business interests, not just foreign but any business interests, that might create any even an appearance of impropriety?\" \"My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict with an appropriate distance from the\u00a0presidency and government,\" Biden responded.\u00a0 Tapper quickly moved on to another topic without any follow-up questions.\u00a0 However, CNN's most prominent anchor was quick to reject the explosive reporting from The New York Post that shed\u00a0light on Hunter Biden's\u00a0questionable foreign business dealings before and after his father was in office as vice president.\u00a0 \"The rightwing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about Biden and his family. Too disgusting to even repeat here,\" Tapper said during a panel discussion on Oct 22.\u00a0\"I mean, some of the ones I've seen from the president's son and some of\u00a0the president's supporters are just wildly unhinged.\"\u00a0 But now, weeks after the presidential election\u00a0as Biden prepares to become the 46th president, the subject of the Biden family's business ties appears to be fair game to Tapper.\u00a0 CNN'S JAKE TAPPER, DON LEMON GUSH OVER BIDEN INTERVIEW: HE SAID 'A LOT OF THE RIGHT ANSWERS' Even Tapper's colleague Don Lemon appeared surprised that the subject was mentioned following the interview.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Project Veritas released recordings of CNN company conference calls that confirmed suspicions of the network's concerted efforts to suppress the Hunter Biden story that was damaging to the Biden campaign after critics\u00a0observed a complete blackout of any coverage of the bombshell reporting.\u00a0 \"Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,\" CNN Political Director David Chalian\u00a0is heard saying during\u00a0a conference call on Oct. 14, the same day the Post released its first reports on Hunter Biden's emails.\u00a0Chalian later insisted the report\u00a0was \"giving its marching orders\"\u00a0to the \"rightwing echo chamber about what to talk about today.\" CNN BOSS RIPS 'USEFUL IDIOT' RUDY GIULIANI FOR PUSHING HUNTER BIDEN 'DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN,' AUDIOTAPE SHOWS Chalian, who also serves as a vice president, continued, \"Obviously, Hunter Biden's lawyer is quoted in the New York Post piece\u00a0and we'll just continue to report out this is the very stuff that the president was impeached over, this is the stuff that Senate Committees looked at and found nothing wrong in\u00a0Joe Biden's interactions with Ukrainians and now having an email that perhaps there was a meeting with someone from Burisma it seems. Rudy Giuliani's sort of 'dream-o-vision' of how to throw stuff at the wall in these closing days of the campaign.\"\u00a0 On the Oct. 23 call, the day after the final presidential debate where\u00a0President Trump\u00a0hammered Biden over the recent revelations involving his son, CNN President Jeff Zucker referred to the story as a \"rabbit hole\" that \"I don't think anybody outside of that [rightwing media] world understood last night\" and later suggested\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's reporting definitively\u00a0proves Biden had \"no role\" in his son's business dealings with China as a reason for CNN not to\u00a0pursue the story itself.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Zucker appeared to allude to the Hunter Biden email scandal in an Oct. 16 conference call released by Project Veritas on Tuesday. \u00a0 \"The Trump media, you know, moves immediately from -- OK, well, never mind -- the unmasking was, you know, found to be completely nonsensical, to the latest alleged scandal and expects everybody to just follow suit,\" Zucker told his staff. \"So, I don't think that we should be repeating unsubstantiated smears just because the right-wing media suggests that we should.\" \"The unmasking\" referenced by Zucker referred to the controversy involving top Obama administration officials, including now-President-elect Biden, requesting to know the identity of then-Trump national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn during the transition period following the 2016 election Zucker's message\u00a0appeared to have resonated with his star anchor, who the following week said the Hunter Biden allegations were \"too disgusting\" to repeat on-air.\u00a0 CNN did not respond to Fox News' multiple requests for comment.\u00a0",

    "article_text": "Biden urges taking coronavirus vaccine, wearing masks but says they shouldn\u2019t be mandatory President-elect Joe Biden said\u00a0he\u2019ll do \u201ceverything in my power\u201d to convince Americans to take the coronavirus vaccines and to wear masks to prevent the spread of the pandemic and save lives.  But as he answered questions from reporters on Friday, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t make vaccines and masks mandatory. BIDEN TO CALL DURING INAUGURATION FOR 100 DAYS OF WEARING MASKS And the president-elect, who spoke\u00a0in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., called Friday\u2019s unemployment report \u201cgrim.\u201d He urged Congress and President Trump to immediately pass a COVID-19 relief measure and warned that \u201cthe future will be very bleak\u201d without such a deal. Biden was asked if taking the vaccine should be mandated for Americans. \u201cI don't think it should be mandatory, I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power -- it's like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide,\u201d Biden replied. And he vowed that he\u2019d \u201cdo everything in my power as president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That\u2019s why I said in my inaugural speech I\u2019m going to ask people to commit to 100 days to wear a mask.\u201d WHERE THE CDC SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD WEAR A MASK The president-elect predicted that \u201cif people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will still be a raging crisis, and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they\u2019re going to see deaths drop off the edge. They\u2019re going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick. And my hope is they\u2019ll then be inclined to say \u2018it\u2019s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people.\u2019\u201d Biden emphasized that when it comes to distributing the vaccines across the country, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more that has to be done.\u201d He said that Trump administration officials have \u201cclued us in our their plan on how they plan to distribute the actual vaccine to the various states but there is no detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen anywhere as to how do you get the vaccine out of a container and into an injection syringe into somebody\u2019s arm. And it\u2019s going to be very difficult for that to be done and it\u2019s a very expensive proposition.\u201d Biden noted that he agrees with the priorities \u201claid out so far\u201d by the Trump administration that those who would receive the vaccines first would be \u201cfirst responders and those in nursing homes and in-home care, the first people on the list.\u201d But he added that \u201cthere has to be some equity in how this is distributed\u201d as he stressed that officials have to figure out how to get the vaccine to minority communities hard hit by the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Biden added. And the president-elect touted that \u201cI think that my taking the vaccine and people seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence.\u201d Taking aim at President Trump, Biden argued that \u201cit\u2019s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it\u2019s been so diminished in this administration thus far.\u201d More than 276,000 deaths throughout\u00a0the country have been tied to the coronavirus since the pandemic swept the nation in February and March, with more than 14.2 million COVID-19 cases in total. There has been a surge in cases throughout much of the nation during the past month. NEW JOBS REPORT SUGGESTS CORONAVIRUS SURGE THREATENING ECONOMIC RECOVERY Speaking hours after the Labor Department reported that jobs increased by 245,000 in November, down from 610,000 in October, Biden described the report as \u201cdire\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d  \u00a0\u201cIt shows an economy that\u2019s stalling,\u201d he said. But he said that if the government reacts now, \u201cwe can regain begin to regain momentum.\u201d But Biden warned that \u201cthere\u2019s no time to lose. Millions of people have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed. They\u2019ve lost their health insurance or are in danger of losing their health insurance. One in every six renters is behind in rent. One in four small businesses can\u2019t keep their doors open.\u201d Biden called on Congress and the president \u201cto act and act now\u201d and warned that \u201cif Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits they rely on. Merry Christmas.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the future will be very bleak. Americans need help and they need it now. And they need more to come early next year,\u201d he added. The president-elect said he was encouraged by a proposed $908 billion bipartisan framework in the Senate and said it showed that both parties can work together.  Biden said that coronavirus stimulus checks for. families \u201cmay be still in play.\u201d He added that \u201cI think it would be better if they had the $1,200\" payments to families. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top two Democrats in Congress, have backed the deal heading into talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden twice dodged questions on whether he's talked yet with McConnell, the top Republican on Capitol Hill. Then-Vice President Biden and McConnell had a history of striking deals to avert fiscal catastrophes during the Obama administration. \u201cMcConnell knows me,\u201d Biden noted. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m straight as an arrow.\u201d Biden also characterized the bipartisan proposal as \u201cjust a down payment\u201d and once again promised to push for more coronavirus relief aid when his administration takes over next month. The president-elect was also asked about pressure from Democrats to name a more diverse cabinet and administration. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see significant diversity,\u201d Biden said. And he emphasized that he\u2019ll name the \u201csingle most diverse cabinet\u2026ever.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

    "article_text": "Biden to call for 100 days of masks after inauguration President-elect Joe Biden said during an interview Thursday that he plans to ask the American public to wear masks for 100 days, starting the day he is inaugurated, in order to drive down the number of coronavirus cases. Biden,\u00a0during an interview with CNN, said he will ask Americans to mask up, but only for a limited period. \"The first day I'm inaugurated I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,\" Biden said. \"Just 100, not forever --\u00a0100 days.\" \"I think we'll see a significant reduction that occurs with vaccinations and masking\u00a0to drive down the numbers considerably.\" Biden's comments come a day after the U.S. recorded a new high in coronavirus-related fatalities on Wednesday at 2,804, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS BY STATE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The nation \u2013\u00a0which has logged\u00a0more\u00a0than 14 million cases and more than 275,000 deaths since the pandemic began\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also recorded 200,070 new daily COVID-19 illnesses, though it did not surpass\u00a0a previous daily case record set Nov. 27 of 205,557. The record daily death toll coincides with news of a record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients, topping 100,000 on Tuesday. The grim milestone comes as health officials warned of surges tied to holiday travel and lockdown fatigue. Biden's comments also come as he urges lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get behind a bipartisan COVID-19 relief effort after a monthslong logjam to deliver much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Wednesday came out in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the basis\u00a0for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall. The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular \u201cpaycheck protection\u201d subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cIn the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan \u201cproblem solvers\u201d coalition. The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. It\u2019s another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn\u2019t as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.

    "article_text": "Ratcliffe urges Biden to let Durham probe run its course, says more docs 'should be' declassified EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Thursday urged President-elect Joe Biden to allow Special Counsel\u00a0John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe to run its course, while saying he hopes there will be \"folks held accountable that should be.\" Ratcliffe, during an interview with Fox News, also indicated that there are\u00a0\u201ca significant number of documents\u201d not within the intelligence community, but that \u201crelate to the counterintelligence investigation at the FBI and at the Justice Department\u201d that have not yet been declassified. \u201cI think it is possible that some of those would be, and should be,\u201d Ratcliffe said. Attorney General William Barr\u00a0made public Tuesday that U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, was appointed in October as special counsel to continue his probe in the next administration. BARR APPOINTS JOHN DURHAM SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE \u201cMy hope is that John Durham, with all of the documents that I have provided in connection with his investigation from the intelligence community, will provide the full accounting and for there to be folks held accountable that should be,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News. He added: \u201cI certainly hope that whoever is running the Justice Department in 2021 will allow these answers to be fully accounted for before the American people.\u201d Ratcliffe said the questions have \u201calready been answered.\u201d \u201cWas there an abuse of power? Legal authorities violated at the FISA court? Did crimes occur? An FBI lawyer has pled guilty in connection with all of that \u2014 so the answer is, it happened,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\u201cThe question now\u00a0is how far, and how deep, is it?\u201d Ratcliffe said. Ratcliffe, during his tenure as director of National Intelligence, has declassified a slew of documents, which allies of President Trump have cast as significant, citing their content as proof that the investigation into the president and his 2016 campaign was baseless. EXCLUSIVE: DNI RATCLIFFE URGES BIDEN TO 'BE HONEST' ABOUT CHINA, NOT TO POLITICIZE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE \u201cThe documents I have declassified reveal that there are folks in the Biden \u2014 or, the Obama-Biden administration, senior national security folks that were aware of the fact that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign \u2014 no intelligence that supported that,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News. \"Remember, we were told, the idea, when I first\u00a0raised the issue of abuse at the FISA\u00a0court, officials said ideas of FISA abuse is a bunch of nonsense, but now very clearly that's proven to be the case \u2014 those violations did occur,\" Ratcliffe said. \"And all of those\u00a0national security\u00a0officials in the Obama-Biden administration,\u00a0like [former FBI Director James] Comey and [Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew]\u00a0McCabe and [Former Deputy Attorney General Sally]\u00a0Yates and others are now running the opposite direction saying oh, had we only known.\"\u00a0 In May, prior to Ratcliffe\u2019s Senate confirmation, acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell cleared for release more than 6,000 pages of transcripts of interviews from the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s long-running Russia investigation. Fox News first reported that top Obama officials, like former DNI James Clapper, testified that he \u201cnever saw any direct empirical evidence\u201d of collusion or a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. HOUSE INTEL TRANSCRIPTS SHOW TOP OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD 'NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE' OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ratcliffe, pointed to other intelligence to \u201creflect that the Trump-Russia collusion was a narrative created by Democrats \u2014 specifically the Clinton campaign.\u201d Ratcliffe was referring to declassified handwritten notes\u00a0belonging to former CIA Director John Brennan, which appeared to show Hillary Clinton\u2019s purported \u201cplan\u201d to tie then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia as \u201ca means of distracting the public form her use of a private email server\u201d ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Ratcliffe also declassified a CIA memo sent to then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to the bureau for potential investigative action. Ratcliffe noted that most of the intelligence community documents that could be declassified \u201chave been, either by myself or Ric Grenell.\u201d DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCUMENTS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW \u201cThere are other documents that I\u2019ve provided to the special counsel that can\u2019t be declassified because they might prejudice his investigation, and those documents that still have sources and methods that can\u2019t be declassified at any point in time,\u201d he explained. Ratcliffe, in October, said that he provided more than 1,000 pages of material to the Justice Department to support Durham\u2019s investigation. Barr notified the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, in a letter dated Dec. 1 obtained by Fox News, that Durham would be special counsel this week. \u201cOn May 13, 2019, I directed John Durham, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, to investigate certain intelligence and law-enforcement activities surrounding the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cAlthough I had expected Mr. Durham to complete his work by the summer of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as additional information he uncovered, prevented him from doing so. \u201cIn advance of the presidential election, I decided to appoint Mr. Durham as a Special Counsel to provide him and his team with the assurance that they could complete their work, without regard to the outcome of the election,\u201d Barr wrote, adding that he appointed Durham with \u201cthe powers and authority of a Special Counsel\u201d on Oct. 19. In a scope order, obtained by Fox News, Barr stated that Durham\u00a0as special counsel \u201cis authorized to investigate whether any federal official, employee, or any other person or entity violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence, or law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, individuals associated with those campaigns, and individuals associated with the administration of President Donald J. Trump, including but not limited to Crossfire Hurricane and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.\u201d DURHAM MOVING 'FULL SPEED AHEAD' Under U.S. code, the special counsel would produce a \u201cconfidential report\u201d and is ordered to \u201csubmit to the Attorney General a final report, and such interim reports as he deems appropriate in a form that will permit public dissemination.\u201d Fox News reported last week that Durham was moving \"full speed ahead\" with his investigation after Election Day.\u00a0 Another source told Fox News that his investigation \u201cis definitely still happening,\u201d despite radio silence coming from the U.S. attorney from Connecticut. Durham\u2019s investigation has produced one criminal charge so far, against former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who was accused of altering an email related to the surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. That prosecution, though, did not allege a broader conspiracy within the FBI, and the conduct it involved had largely been laid out in a Justice Department inspector general report from last December. After the Clinesmith charge, Durham\u2019s team went silent. Two sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News over the summer that Durham was not finished with several lines of investigation, which he believed were \u201ccritical.\u201d One source told Fox News Durham had been \u201cfeeling more pressure to get this done and wrapped up\u201d over the summer, but said that Durham \u201cdoes not want this to be viewed political,\u201d and would likely \u201cpunt it to after the election,\u201d which he ultimately did. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Durham was appointed by Barr last year to investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe, shortly after special counsel Robert Mueller completed his yearlong investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election. Mueller\u2019s investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.",

    "article_text": "Trump says if he's right about election fraud, 'Biden can't be president' President Trump is once again charging that last month\u2019s presidential election was rigged and rampant with fraud. In an address posted on his Twitter and Facebook pages that the president described as possibly \u201cthe most important speech, I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Trump charged that \u201clots of bad things happened\u201d during the election. WHISTLEBLOWERS SHARE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF ALLEGED ELECTION IRREGULARITIES And he argued that\u00a0\"if we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can't be president. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. We're talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before.\" Taking aim again at the surge in absentee balloting and early voting due to health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, the president emphasized that \u201cwe used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days, weeks and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time.\u201d \"The mail and voting scam is the latest part of their four-year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

The president has refused to concede to Biden, more than three and a half weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news organizations projected that the former vice president would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect.  Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battleground states, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. And recounts requested by Trump in Georgia and Wisconsin, two of the six key battleground states that Biden narrowly edged Trump and which the president has contested, have to date failed to alter Biden's victories. On Sunday, in his first interview since the election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS FROM FOX NEWS \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team. In his speech on Wednesday, the president said that \u201cwe are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted.\u201d And he emphasized that his efforts are \u201cabout ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Hyperpartisan CNN heaps praise on Biden team's transparency: 'No B.S.' about injury Liberal networks MSNBC and CNN took different approaches to news that President-elect Joe Biden sustained a hairline fracture in his right foot, as the latter\u00a0avoided criticism of the incoming administration stalling to inform reporters and managed to attack President Trump instead. MSNBC anchor\u00a0Andrea Mitchell scolded the Biden team Monday for its\u00a0lack of transparency about\u00a0the\u00a0president-elect's foot injury, which occurred\u00a0Saturday. The veteran MSNBC host complained it \"wasn't until Sunday\" that the White House press pool found out\u00a0Biden was \"going somewhere,\" which ended up being a visit to the doctor. She suggested it should not have taken so long for the public to find out. CNN USES BIDEN\u2019S FOOT INJURY TO FAWN OVER TRANSPARENCY OF INCOMING ADMINISTRATION \"They weren\u2019t as forthcoming as you would hope they would be with the press pool that\u2019s supposed to cover him,\" Mitchell said. PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, who was a panelist on Mitchell\u2019s program, agreed, saying there has already been some \u201ctension\u201d between Biden and the press because the president-elect often goes out in public after calling a \u201clid,\u201d which indicates he\u2019s done making appearances for the day. \u201cThe transition wasn\u2019t giving reporters the heads-up they would need,\u201d Alcindor said. While journalists from MSNBC and PBS were truthful about the situation, hyperpartisan CNN took a much different approach and used the foot injury as an opportunity to praise Biden and his team. MSNBC'S ANDREA MITCHELL HITS BIDEN TEAM FOR NOT BEING 'FORTHCOMING' ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT'S FOOT INJURY CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza wrote a glowing piece headlined, \u201cWhy Joe Biden's broken foot reveals how different his White House will be from Donald Trump's.\u201d The CNN pundit noted that Trump was famously secretive about an unscheduled 2019 visit to Walter Reed Medical Center but Biden\u2019s staffers \u201cquickly\u201d updated reporters on his injury. \u201cNotice the difference?

Andrew Cuomo, continued the lavish praise of Biden on Monday night. \u201cWe just got the straight truth about [the foot injury]. No lie, no deny\u2026 there was no B.S. There was no blocking us from the reason that Trump was rushed to a hospital, no fugazi\u00a0doctors with absurd, lauding statements about Biden being superhuman, strongest pinky toe in history. Just the truth,\u201d Cuomo said without acknowledging the nearly 24-hour delay that even MSNBC complained about. Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson isn\u2019t surprised that CNN would ignore Biden-related issues and stick with its anti-Trump agenda. CNN REPORTER DRAWS RIDICULE FOR CONGRATULATING HERSELF, COLLEAGUES ON TRUMP ANSWERING QUESTIONS \"Whenever there was even a hint of illness for Donald Trump, the mainstream media put a negative political spin on it, portraying Trump as reckless or secretive,\u00a0or both. Now that Joe Biden has a mild injury, CNN still is putting a\u00a0negative political spin on it -- against Trump. Some habits are hard to break,\" Jacobson told Fox News. While Mitchell and Alcindor at least acknowledged the Biden team\u2019s delay in transparency, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders doesn\u2019t think the mainstream media will hold the president-elect accountable anytime soon. \u201cMy guess is they\u2019ll give him a free pass like they\u2019ve done on everything else in the campaign over the last year and a half. They don\u2019t push for questions, we saw them celebrating, a group of journalists in the press pool celebrating they got Donald Trump to answer a question,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d referring to a picture tweeted by CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins last week.

It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.\"\u00a0 Reporters covering the president-elect were not afforded the opportunity to see Biden enter the doctor's office, despite multiple requests.

    "article_text": "Arizona certifies Biden as election winner, with Wisconsin following hours later President Trump suffered another setback in his push to overturn his defeat in the presidential election,\u00a0as Arizona\u00a0on Monday certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The results of the election were certified by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's a Democrat, with GOP Gov. Doug Ducey,\u00a0Republican state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Brutinel in attendance. TRUMP PRESSES 'HAPLESS' REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA TO OVERULE SECRETARY OF STATE Hours after the certifying of the vote in Arizona, Wisconsin finalized their results, becoming the last of the remaining contested battleground states to do so. Biden was projected the winner in Arizona on Election Night by Fox News and The Associated Press. The other major news networks projected Biden as the winner in the state a week later. Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. The former vice president became the first Democrat since President Bill Clinton in 1996 to carry Arizona, and only the third since President Harry Truman in 1948. In Wisconsin, state Elections Commission chair Ann Jacobs signed \"the official state determination of the results of the Nov. 3, 2020 election.\" The move, which confirmed Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, came a day after the completion of a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign. The recount slightly altered the results in Biden\u2019s favor. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers certified the election results later in the day. That kicked off a five-day window for the president to file a lawsuit in Wisconsin. On Saturday, Trump said he would bring a lawsuit in the state by Tuesday. The actions by both states are the latest setback for the president, who refuses to concede to Biden, more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect. Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battlegrounds, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden's victories. Trump's defeat in Arizona -- since the margin was greater than a tenth of 1 percent -- doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. A lawsuit by the state GOP to force a hand recount of some ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest, was dismissed on Nov. 19, due to no evidence of voter fraud. TRUMP BLASTS LEGAL SETBACKS TO HIS PUSH TO OVERTURN HIS ELECTION DEFEAT The top two attorneys steering Trump's legal efforts -- Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- appeared Monday in Phoenix with a group of GOP state lawmakers, for a \"fact-finding\" meeting to discuss potential fraud in the election. The two lawyers took part in a similar meeting last week in Pennsylvania, another state where Biden narrowly defeated the president. Pennsylvania, as well as the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada\u00a0and Georgia, have also certified their election results over the past week and a half. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.

What is na\u00efve is to think it is remotely possible to govern this country unless we can. That is what is na\u00efve.\u201d The week prior to this event, Clinton was asked to name which enemy she has made in her career that she was most proud of and responded with a list. \u201cWell, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians; probably the Republicans,\u201d she said. JUDGE HALTS 3 ATLANTA-AREA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA Biden considered running against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination around this time. He named her in his speech at the gala, saying she was \u201cgreat\u201d in her post as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, but couldn\u2019t carry the same weight speaking to foreign leaders that he could. The day after Tanden\u2019s email was sent, Biden announced he would not be running against Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president.

If confirmed by the Senate, Tanden will be the first Indian-American and first woman of color to serve as the director of the OMB.",

President-elect Joe Biden plans to name Tanden, the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, according to a person familiar with the transition process granted anonymity to speak freely about internal deliberations.\u00a0Kristol, who has gone from prominent conservative to anti-Trump pundit, took to Twitter to endorse the selection. \u201cSerious conservatives, responsible moderates, and hard-headed liberals should want a tough-minded OMB head. OMB is where Cabinet secretaries' ill-considered projects go to die, where programs are evaluated, where trade-offs are made. Neera Tanden is the right person for the job,\u201d Kristol tweeted. BIDEN CHOOSES AN ALL-FEMALE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRESS TEAM Kristol was once a highly influential conservative but he has drifted to the left in recent years and is an outspoken critic of President Trump. \u00a0 \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain, who serves as the show\u2019s token conservative, blasted Kristol for the suggestion. \u201cPlease don't insult me and say as a serious conservative I should be supporting the head of the hard-left advocacy group Center for American Progress. Intellectually dishonest and craven on your part Bill,\u201d McCain responded. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote, \u201cIf someone in 2014 told you this tweet would exist six years later, try to process your reaction.\u201d MCENANY DISMISSES REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS DURING BRIEFING: 'I DON'T CALL ON ACTIVISTS' Journalist Glenn Greenwald responded, \u201cPut this tweet up in the American History Museum under the title \u2018Democrats in the Trump Era\u2019 and you'll be all done with that part of history.\u201d Many others blasted Kristol\u2019s tweet, too: CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Linda Brickman testified before Arizona state legislators on Monday, stating that she witnessed votes being entered into the Dominion system automatically changed to reflect a vote for Biden. She said she was threatened and barred from the counting room after telling her supervisor what she saw. Despite multiple witnesses coming forward with similar stories, counters were reportedly never told whether any action had been taken to correct the miscount.  Maricopa County is among the largest in the nation with more than 2 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cI read her a Trump Republican ballot and as soon as she entered it into the system, the ballot defaulted on the screen to a Biden Democratic ballot,\u201d explained the GOP vice chairwoman. Brickman said her purpose of appearing at the hearing was to speak the truth and protect the integrity of the election.",
