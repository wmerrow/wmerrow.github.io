    "article_text": "Three Years After Family Separation, Her Son Is Back. But Her Life Is Not. When Leticia Peren bid her 15-year-old son, Yovany, good night in a Texas Border Patrol station three years ago, he was still small enough that she, standing less than five feet tall, reached down a little when she placed her hand on his shoulder and urged him to rest. Earlier that night, the two of them had concluded their long journey from Guatemala by walking for hours in the whistling desert wind, losing sight of their own feet in mud that felt like quicksand. The Border Patrol agents who apprehended them outside of Presidio, Texas, placed them in separate cells. Exhausted, Ms. Peren fell into a deep sleep, but woke up to a new nightmare. Yovany was gone, sent to a shelter in Arizona. Ms. Peren had no money and no lawyer. When she next saw him, more than two years had passed. At the time of their reunification, Yovany was the last remaining child in custody who the federal government considered eligible to be released. The bonds broken during their 26 months apart \u2014 when Ms. Peren was a voice on the phone more than 1,500 miles away, as Yovany made new friends, went to a new school, learned to live without her \u2014 have been slow to regrow. By the time they were reunited, her son had matured into a young man, taller than her and with a deepening voice, one he could use to hold a conversation in English. Ms. Peren, frantic during the time it took to get him back, had lost some of her hair and developed a condition that, when triggered by stress, caused her face to sag on one side. Years after the mass separations of migrant families spurred a national outcry because of the trauma they caused, much of the public outrage over the policy eased as thousands of parents and children were eventually reunited. But for families like Ms. Peren\u2019s, swept up by the Trump administration\u2019s most widely debated attempt to deter immigration, the story did not end when the policy did. To some degree, Ms. Peren and her son are lucky. They are being sponsored by an affluent family who took them into their spacious house in a well-heeled Brooklyn neighborhood. Volunteer groups have acted as informal social workers, tracking down doctors to provide free medical care and answering crisis phone calls at any hour. But such groups are running short of resources now. \u201cEverybody\u2019s tapped out emotionally, financially, caseload wise,\u201d said Julie Schwietert Collazo, the director of one such group, Immigrant Families Together. \u201cThe need is kind of endless. There are cases where I\u2019ve called so many people and nobody will help me.\u201d And it is sometimes confounding to Ms. Peren that she could feel so troubled in the home where she and Yovany are living, with its fancy appliances and art from around the world. Her childhood home in Guatemala had a dirt floor surrounded in part by chicken wire rather than exterior walls. When she was 8, her mother sent her away to do domestic work in the homes of wealthier Guatemalan families who could afford to feed her. At 16, Ms. Peren fell in love with a boy her age whose home she worked in. But the boy\u2019s family rejected her because she was poor, uneducated and Indigenous. After Yovany was born, she continued working with her baby strapped to her back as she dusted, swept and mopped until on the verge of collapse. \u201cI would say to him, I\u2019m your dad, I\u2019m your mom, I\u2019m your brother, I\u2019m your sister, I\u2019m your friend,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been together, the two of us.\u201d But by the end of 2015, the lawlessness in her city was starting to intensify. Gang members were urging Yovany, then in middle school, to join their ranks. At one point, she said, a man held a gun to her head and threatened to kill Yovany if she did not come up with several thousand quetzales a month, which she did not have. She decided to move north rather than risk what might happen next. Word of the family separations at the American border, which had only just begun, had not made its way to most of Central America. After Yovany was taken from a Border Patrol station cell overnight, Ms. Peren spent seven months trying to figure out how to get him back. Finally, seeing no other option, she agreed to her own deportation, believing she could fight more effectively if she were free. After her release, she and Yovany kept in touch regularly through WhatsApp messages. Ms. Peren did not want her son to know how much she was suffering. Yovany did not want to tell her that his life was improving. After spending about nine months in a children\u2019s shelter in Arizona that he called the saddest place he had ever been, Yovany had been released to a foster family in Texas that welcomed him warmly. The parents gave him a tablet computer, which he used to film music videos with the other Central American boys living in the home. Yovany bonded with the couple\u2019s 3-year-old son and helped to take care of him. A couple of times, the family floated the idea of adopting him, but Ms. Peren shut it down immediately. In March 2019, lawyers who were soliciting support for separated families made a presentation in a Hindu ashram in Queens, which Sunita Viswanath, an Indian-born human rights activist, occasionally attended. She and her husband, Stephan Shaw, figured that their large home, where they often housed multicultural artists and other activists passing through New York, could easily accommodate a mother and child. They agreed to take full financial responsibility for Ms. Peren if she were allowed back into the United States to be reunited with Yovany. The night before Ms. Peren arrived in New York, more than two years after her first journey to the United States, Mr. Shaw spent hours on Duolingo practicing his halting Spanish. He was the only one in his family with any knowledge of the language. Sitting in their living room with a reporter, Mr. Shaw and Ms. Viswanath, along with her parents and two of the couple\u2019s sons, greeted Ms. Peren with big smiles. She looked at them nervously as her lawyers translated the family\u2019s questions: How was your flight? Are you tired? Hungry? They sat down to a meal of Indian food, which Ms. Peren had never seen before. She pushed the food around on her plate. Ms. Viswanath asked if she would be taking a citizenship test soon. Ms. Peren\u2019s lawyers explained that such a possibility was years away. Her asylum case, a first step, had not even begun. Ms. Peren said good night and settled into her room: the first in her life that she had not had to share. But she felt so lonely and unable to communicate that she cried herself to sleep. Without a job, Ms. Peren fell into a familiar role as a house cleaner while she waited for the government to approve her son\u2019s release. The family discouraged her, but she insisted that the scrubbing and dusting was calming, and that she had nothing else to do. After nearly a month of waiting for Yovany, she met his flight at La Guardia Airport, but their relationship did not immediately fall back into place. Standing at the gate to greet him, Ms. Peren burst into tears and hugged him fiercely. But then they both recoiled a little. As they walked to baggage claim to retrieve Yovany\u2019s things, they did not make eye contact. In the car on the way home, he video-chatted with the friends he had left behind in Texas. Yovany\u2019s presence eased any tension in the home as he lapped up the affection of the host family. Ms. Viswanath began tutoring him in reading. Her parents grew enamored of him because he did chores without asking. Yovany beamed on the brink of tears one afternoon when, after he had announced that he wanted to become a filmmaker, Mr. Shaw gave him a hand-me-down Canon camera. Their 12-year-old son, Satya, started teaching him to play piano. Establishing relationships outside the home proved more difficult. Yovany tried to reconnect with some of the children he had met in detention, who had since moved to New York, but they lived in immigrant enclaves in Queens and the Bronx, and worked when they were not in high school. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the household quarantined together for a few months, after which Mr. Shaw, Ms. Viswanath and their son decamped to their second home in New Mexico. Ms. Viswanath\u2019s parents eventually joined them, but Ms. Peren and Yovany had to stay in New York as a condition of their pending immigration cases. But there was miscommunication with the advocacy organizations about who would take care of Ms. Peren\u2019s basic needs. Mr. Shaw thought Immigrant Families Together would be delivering groceries weekly, and he left only enough money for anything extra Ms. Peren might need. But food was only delivered a couple of times. When the money ran out, Ms. Peren did not want to ask for more. She was ashamed that she had been reliant on the family for so long. She stormed out of the house one afternoon and walked down the street at a frantic clip, asking anyone who appeared to speak Spanish if they knew where she could find a job. Most, she said, looked at her like she was crazy. A Peruvian woman told her about a Hasidic neighborhood where she could line up for work cleaning houses, but warned that she would have to compete against others who spoke English. The first several times, Ms. Peren went home empty-handed. Eventually, she began getting work at least one day a week. \u201cIt\u2019s something,\u201d she said one recent evening, \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel any closer to being able to be independent.\u201d In some ways, Ms. Peren said, her life is much better than before. She and Yovany have warmed to each other again. They laugh and stay up late at night talking. But even now, they keep the conversation light, not yet ready to share everything, or listen to an honest account of the more than two years they spent apart. Ms. Peren says she has come to understand that being reunited with her son did not restore the bonds they once shared. Instead, she said, they are different people in a new place, building a relationship that is, in some ways, just beginning.",

    "article_text": "Trump Administration Declines to Tighten Soot Rules, Despite Link to Covid Deaths WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday declined to tighten controls on industrial soot emissions, disregarding an emerging scientific link between dirty air and Covid-19 death rates. In one of the final policy moves of an administration that has spent the past four years weakening or rolling back more than 100 environmental regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency completed a regulation that keeps in place, rather than tightening, rules on tiny, lung-damaging industrial particles, known as PM 2.5, even though the agency\u2019s own scientists have warned of the links between the pollutants and respiratory illness. E.P.A. administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to announce the rule Monday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the matter. Public health experts say that the rule defies scientific research, including the work of the E.P.A.\u2019s own public health experts, which indicates that PM 2.5 pollution contributes to tens of thousands of premature deaths annually, and that even a slight tightening of controls on fine soot could save thousands of American lives. In April, researchers at Harvard released the first nationwide study linking long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and Covid-19 death rates. The study found that a person living for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate matter is 15 percent more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution. The new rule retains a standard enacted in 2012. That rule limited the pollution of industrial fine soot particles \u2014 each about 1/30th the width of a human hair, but associated with heart attacks, strokes and premature deaths \u2014 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. By law, the E.P.A. is required every five years to review the latest science and update that standard. When E.P.A. scientists conducted that mandatory review, many concluded that if the federal government tightened that standard to about nine micrograms per cubic meter, more than 10,000 American lives could be saved a year. In a draft 457-page scientific assessment of the risks associated with keeping or strengthening the fine soot pollution rule, career scientists at the E.P.A. estimated that the current standard is \u201cassociated with 45,000 deaths\u201d annually. The scientists wrote that if the rule were tightened to nine micrograms per cubic meter, annual deaths would fall by about 27 percent, which amounts to 12,150 people a year. After the publication of that report, numerous industries, including oil and coal companies, automakers and chemical manufacturers, urged the Trump administration to disregard the findings and not tighten the rule. In a November 2019 public comment submitted by 13 industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry representatives wrote, \u201csignificant uncertainty remains about the relationship between exposure to PM 2.5 and adverse effects on public health.\u201d The E.P.A.\u2019s leaders agreed with the industries\u2019 assessment. In December last year, a seven-member E.P.A. advisory panel, composed mostly of members appointed by Trump administration, told Mr. Wheeler the career scientists\u2019 findings were not conclusive enough to support tightening the rule. A final version of the scientists\u2019 report, published in January to preview the still-unpublished rule, does say the rule as it stands contributes to 45,000 deaths annually, but it also says only that tightening it would reduce \u201chealth risks,\u201d not deaths.",

    "article_text": "In Georgia Debate, Kelly Loeffler Won\u2019t Say Trump Lost ATLANTA \u2014 In a televised debate on Sunday night, Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Georgia Republican, declined to say that President Trump had lost the election, arguing instead that the president had \u201cevery legal recourse available\u201d to pursue his baseless assertion that the vote in Georgia was rigged against him. Ms. Loeffler, whose runoff race is one of two in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate on Jan. 5, has emerged as a staunch defender of Mr. Trump. She used the debate to label her Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, as a \u201cradical liberal\u201d more than a dozen times over the course of an hour. Mr. Warnock criticized Ms. Loeffler, one of the richest members of the Senate, for making a large number of stock trades after she attended a briefing on the coronavirus in January. Ms. Loeffler did not answer directly when asked whether members of Congress should be barred from trading stocks. \u201cLook, what\u2019s at stake here in this election is the American dream,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, calling the question of her stock trades \u201ca left-wing media lie.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is an attack on every single Georgian who gets up every day to work hard to provide a better life for their family.\u201d Ms. Loeffler\u2019s trades and those of two other senators were investigated by the Justice Department, but the department announced in May that it would not pursue insider trading charges against them. A Senate Ethics Committee investigation also found no evidence of violations. The debate came one day after Mr. Trump held a rally in Georgia in which he falsely claimed that he had won the state \u2014 and after he made a phone call to Gov. Brian Kemp, asking him to call a special session of the Republican-controlled legislature so that lawmakers could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, both Republicans, said that a special session would not be called in Georgia, reiterating a position they had taken previously. \u201cDoing this in order to select a separate slate of presidential electors is not an option that is allowed under state or federal law,\u201d they said. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Duncan added that state law allows the legislature only to \u201cdirect an alternative method for choosing presidential electors if the election was not able to be held on the date set by federal law.\u201d Ms. Loeffler and Georgia\u2019s other Republican senator, David Perdue, have both stuck by the president, attending the rally with him in Valdosta, Ga., on Saturday. But prominent Republicans are worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s airing of his grievances about his loss in the state might convince his supporters that Georgia\u2019s voting system is indeed rigged and that they should sit out the crucially important runoff elections. Losses by both Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue would hand control of the Senate to the Democrats. At the debate, Ms. Loeffler hammered repeatedly on her theme that Mr. Warnock \u2014 the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached \u2014 was dangerously out of step with Georgia values. She said that he had criticized the police from the pulpit and advocated \u201csocialism\u201d and abortion rights. Mr. Warnock also portrayed Ms. Loeffler as being out of touch, bringing up her stock trades and criticizing her initial opposition to Congress\u2019s relief package for people and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. (Ms. Loeffler eventually voted for the $2 trillion package in March.) Mr. Warnock also sought to make the case, late in the debate, that Ms. Loeffler was a radical in her own right, noting that she \u201cwelcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist,\u201d a likely reference to Representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has espoused the movement\u2019s pro-Trump conspiracy theories in the past. The debate came at the end of a day made particularly tense by Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion, at his Saturday night rally, that the presidential election had been \u201crigged\u201d in Georgia, a state that two recounts have shown he lost. The latest tally has Joseph R. Biden Jr. winning by about 12,000 votes. Georgia has already seen remarkable Republican infighting over Mr. Trump\u2019s push to reverse the results of the race. Violent threats against elections workers have grown so problematic that a top state elections official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, last week asked the president to check his inflammatory language. On Sunday morning, high-ranking Georgia officials from Mr. Trump\u2019s own party pushed back, yet again, against the president\u2019s bogus assertions of widespread electoral fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has become one of the chief targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath in recent days, went on the ABC program \u201cThis Week\u201d and addressed the president\u2019s phone call to Mr. Kemp. Mr. Raffensperger, who, like Mr. Kemp, supported Mr. Trump in the election, said that holding a special session would amount to \u201cnullifying the will of the people.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, the voice of the people were spoken,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed as a conservative Republican also.\u201d The other runoff race in Georgia pits Mr. Perdue, a former corporate executive, against Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker. Mr. Perdue declined to attend a debate with Mr. Ossoff on Sunday, which resulted in a strange 30-minute session in which Mr. Ossoff faced off against an empty lectern. Mr. Ossoff called Mr. Perdue a \u201ccoward\u201d for not debating and criticized what he described as the senator\u2019s early understatement of the threat posed by the coronavirus. \u201cThe reason that we are losing thousands of people per day to this virus is because of the arrogance of politicians like David Perdue,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. \u201cSo arrogant that he disregarded public health expertise, and so arrogant that he\u2019s not with us here today to answer questions.\u201d He added, \u201cHe believes the Senate seat belongs to him.\u201d Standing alone on the debate stage, Mr. Ossoff took aim, as he has in the past, at Mr. Perdue\u2019s own controversial stock trades, which prompted Mr. Ossoff in a previous debate to call Mr. Perdue a \u201ccrook.\u201d The New York Times has reported that the Justice Department investigated but declined to charge Mr. Perdue for possible insider trading over his sale of more than $1 million worth of stock in a financial-analysis firm. The Times and other outlets have also documented numerous instances in which Mr. Perdue traded stocks in companies that stood to benefit from policies before committees and subcommittees on which he serves. \u201cHis blatant abuse of his power and privilege to enrich himself is disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. Mr. Perdue has previously said he has done nothing wrong. At one point in Ms. Loeffler\u2019s debate with Mr. Warnock, she asked him about his arrest in 2002 for obstructing law enforcement officials who were conducting a child abuse investigation at a summer camp in Maryland that was affiliated with Mr. Warnock\u2019s church at the time. Mr. Warnock responded that he was \u201cworking at trying to make sure that young people, who were being questioned by law enforcement, had the benefit of counsel, a lawyer or a parent.\u201d He added, \u201cThe law enforcement officers actually later thanked me for my cooperation and for helping them.\u201d The website PolitiFact and others have noted that the charges were dismissed by a judge after a prosecutor said there had been a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with Mr. Warnock, who had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d with the investigation. Mr. Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia was a remarkable upset for Democrats in a state that has been reliably Republican for years. The result sent a shock wave through the state\u2019s conservative establishment. Last week, a group of prominent Georgia Republicans, including former Gov. Nathan Deal, released an open letter arguing that Republicans need to heal their divisions, unify their party and focus on the runoffs if they are to maintain control of the Senate. Mr. Trump\u2019s war with Georgia\u2019s Republican leadership over the state\u2019s election results continues to put Republicans who oversaw the election in the position of defending the integrity of the voting system. \u201cThe president\u2019s statements are false,\u201d Mr. Sterling, the elections official, said in an appearance on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThey are misinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters \u2014 and hell, I voted for him.\u201d Mr. Trump has raised a flurry of claims to try to undermine the results, railing against vote-counting machines and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots are rife with fraud. Mr. Sterling gained widespread attention last week for directly calling out Mr. Trump at an emotional news conference, during which he condemned the spread of spurious claims surrounding the election and the silence of Republicans who were refusing to challenge it. On Sunday, Mr. Sterling reiterated his outrage and his disappointment, particularly in Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, who for the most part have stood by Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. \u201cWe need to hold on to the Senate, so I\u2019m still going to vote for them. But I\u2019m not happy with how they\u2019ve conducted themselves in this particular situation.\u201d Richard Fausset reported from Atlanta, and Rick Rojas from Nashville.",

    "article_text": "Barr Is Said to Be Weighing Whether to Leave Before Trump\u2019s Term Ends WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr is considering stepping down before President Trump\u2019s term ends next month, according to three people familiar with his thinking. One said Mr. Barr could announce his departure before the end of the year. It was not clear whether the attorney general\u2019s deliberations were influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to concede his election loss or his fury over Mr. Barr\u2019s acknowledgment last week that the Justice Department uncovered no widespread voting fraud. In the ensuing days, the president refused to say whether he still had confidence in his attorney general. One of the people insisted that Mr. Barr had been weighing his departure since before last week and that Mr. Trump had not affected the attorney general\u2019s thinking. Another said Mr. Barr had concluded that he had completed the work that he set out to accomplish at the Justice Department. But the president\u2019s public complaints about the election, including a baseless allegation earlier last week that federal law enforcement had rigged the election against him, are certain to cast a cloud over any early departure by Mr. Barr. By leaving early, Mr. Barr could avoid a confrontation with the president over his refusal to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite the election results. Mr. Barr\u2019s departure would also deprive the president of a cabinet officer who has wielded the power of the Justice Department more deeply in service of a president\u2019s political agenda than any attorney general in a half-century. Conversely, it would please some Trump allies, who have called for Mr. Barr to step down over his refusal to wade further into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election outcome. Mr. Barr has not made a final decision, and the prospect of him staying on through Jan. 20 remains a possibility, the people familiar with his thinking cautioned. Should Mr. Barr step down before the end of the Trump administration, the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, would be expected to lead the Justice Department until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is sworn in. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The White House had no comment. Mr. Barr, 70, is the strongest proponent of presidential power to hold the office of attorney general since Watergate. Soon after he was confirmed in February 2019, he gained Mr. Trump\u2019s trust and his ear. He managed to heal fissures between the White House and the Justice Department that broke open when the president learned that his campaign was under investigation related to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Barr believed that the F.B.I. had abused its power in investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. An independent inspector general has found that the bureau had sufficient reason to open the inquiry and that senior officials there acted without political bias in doing so. But weeks after taking office, Mr. Barr released a summary of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that a judge later called distorted and misleading. He presented it in the best possible light for Mr. Trump before the public could read it. Mr. Barr soon asked John H. Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to open an investigation into the Russia inquiry itself to seek out any wrongdoing under the Obama administration. While that investigation has not yet produced the kind of results that Mr. Trump has explicitly said he would like to see \u2014 including criminal charges against former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden, as well as the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey \u2014 Mr. Barr has ensured that Mr. Durham\u2019s work will continue into the next administration. In October, he secretly appointed Mr. Durham a special counsel assigned to seek out any wrongdoing in the course of the Russia investigation. Mr. Barr revealed that appointment last week at the same time that he said he had not seen evidence that voter fraud had affected the results of the election. Pairing the Durham announcement with that revelation was widely seen as an effort to placate Mr. Trump, who was said to be enraged that Mr. Barr had publicly contradicted him. Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Barr was among the loudest voices warning that mail-in ballots would result in mass election fraud. He routinely claimed in speeches and interviews that the potential for widespread voter fraud was high and posed a grave danger. Mr. Barr\u2019s claims were sometimes false or exaggerated and were widely refuted. \u201cI don\u2019t have empirical evidence other than the fact that we\u2019ve always had voting fraud. And there always will be people who attempt to do that,\u201d Mr. Barr said in September. He called his conclusions \u201ccommon sense.\u201d And after the election, Mr. Barr opened the door to politically charged election fraud investigations, authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate \u201cspecific allegations\u201d of voter fraud before results were certified. Typically, the Justice Department waits until after vote totals are certified to investigate such suspicions in order to avoid shaking public confidence in elections. At the same time, Mr. Barr\u2019s public appearances dwindled, and he did not comment on the results or Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the outcome. But as the president\u2019s legal challenges hit a dead end, the pressure on Mr. Barr to speak out increased when Mr. Trump suggested in an interview on Nov. 29 that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. might have been \u201cinvolved\u201d in some sort of election fraud. \u201cThis is total fraud. And how the F.B.I. and Department of Justice \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re involved \u2014 but how people are allowed to get away with this stuff is unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. Mr. Barr broke his silence a few days later, telling The Associated Press that he had not seen evidence of election fraud on a scale that would have changed the fact that Mr. Biden won. \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,\u201d he said. With Mr. Barr\u2019s departure, Mr. Trump would lose the cabinet official who has carried out his agenda on policing, racial unrest, affirmative action and immigration. Unlike officials who have privately denigrated Mr. Trump, department officials and friends say that Mr. Barr agrees with most, if not all, of the president\u2019s positions, as well as his view that he was wronged by the Obama administration. Mr. Barr himself has taken umbrage at the notion that his actions that helped Mr. Trump\u2019s allies \u2014 reducing a sentencing recommendation for the president\u2019s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. on seven felony convictions and seeking to withdraw the prosecution of Michael T. Flynn on a charge of lying to investigators \u2014 were done at the president\u2019s behest. He has publicly and privately insisted that he would have made those moves no matter what because he felt they were right. When Mr. Barr left the Justice Department in 1993 after serving as attorney general under President George Bush, he became the general counsel of the telecommunications company GTE Corp., which eventually became Verizon. That stint at the company ended with a $10.4 million payout and made him a millionaire many times over, making it unlikely that he will take another full-time job after he leaves the department.",

    "article_text": "Giuliani has tested positive for the coronavirus, Trump says. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and President Trump\u2019s personal and campaign lawyer, has tested positive for the coronavirus, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter on Sunday. Mr. Giuliani has been admitted to Georgetown University Medical Center, according to a person who was aware of his condition but not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Giuliani, at age 76, is in the high-risk category for the virus. Later Sunday, he wrote on Twitter: \u201cThank you to all my friends and followers for all the prayers and kind wishes. I\u2019m getting great care and feeling good. Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything.\u201d His son, Andrew H. Giuliani, a White House adviser, said on Nov. 20 he had tested positive for the virus. He had appeared at a news conference with his father the day before. Mr. Giuliani has been acting as the lead lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overthrow the results of the election. He has repeatedly claimed he has evidence of widespread fraud, but he has declined to submit that evidence in legal cases he has filed. \u201c@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus. Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear why Mr. Trump was the one announcing it. Mr. Giuliani recently traveled to three battleground states that Mr. Biden won to make his case. On Thursday he attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol, where he didn\u2019t wear a mask. He also went maskless on Wednesday at a legislative session in Michigan, where he lobbied Republicans to overturn the results of the election there and appoint a slate of electors for Trump. \u201cMayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia,\u201d the Trump campaign said. \u201cThe Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return.\u201d However, a person in contact with the former mayor said he began feeling ill late this past week. Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly been exposed to the virus through contact with infected people, including during Mr. Trump\u2019s preparation for his first debate against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. in September, just before the president tested positive. His infection is the latest in a string of outbreaks among those in the president\u2019s orbit. Boris Epshteyn, a member of the Trump campaign legal team, tested positive late last month. The same day, Mr. Giuliani attended a meeting of Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania about allegations of voting irregularities. One of the lawmakers at that meeting was notified shortly after, while at the White House, that he had tested positive. Mark Meadows, the president\u2019s chief of staff, and at least eight others in the White House and Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, tested positive in the days before and after Election Day. Mr. Trump was hospitalized on Oct. 2 after contracting the coronavirus. Kayleigh McEnany, the president\u2019s press secretary, Corey Lewandowski, a campaign adviser, and Ben Carson, the housing secretary, are among those in the president\u2019s circle who have tested positive this fall. Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News earlier on Sunday. Speaking with the host Maria Bartiromo via satellite, Mr. Giuliani repeated baseless claims about fraud in Georgia and Wisconsin on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d When asked if he believed Mr. Trump still had a path to victory, he said, \u201cWe do.\u201d Melina Delkic and Bryan Pietsch contributed reporting.  After a small White House outbreak in September and a wave of cases in early October, the coronavirus has returned to the top of the Trump administration.",

    "article_text": "Why Do So Many Americans Think the Election Was Stolen? There have been few surprises this past month in how Donald Trump has dealt with the reality of his electoral defeat. Anyone familiar with his career could have predicted that he would claim to have been cheated out of victory. Anyone watching how he wielded power (or, more often, didn\u2019t) as president could have predicted that his efforts to challenge the election results would be embarrassing, ridiculous and dismissed with prejudice in court. And anyone watching how the Republican Party dealt with his ascent could have predicted that its leaders would mostly avoid directly rebuking him, relying instead on the inertial forces of American democracy, the conscientiousness of judges and local officialdom, and Trump\u2019s own incompetence to turn back his final power grab. So far, so predictable. But speaking as a cynical observer of the Trump era, one feature of November did crack my jaded shell a bit: not his behavior or the system\u2019s response, but the sheer scale of the belief among conservatives that the election was really stolen, measured not just in polling data but in conversations and arguments, online and in person, with people I would not have expected to embrace it. The potency of this belief has already scrambled some of the conventional explanations for conspiratorial beliefs, particularly the conceit that the key problem is misinformation spreading downward from partisan news outlets and social-media fraudsters to the easily deceived. As I watch the way certain fraud theories spread online, or watch conservatives abandon Fox News for Newsmax in search of validating narratives, it\u2019s clear that this is about demand as much as supply. A strong belief spurs people to go out in search of evidence, a lot of so-called disinformation is collected and circulated sincerely rather than cynically, and the power of various authorities \u2014 Tucker Carlson\u2019s show or Facebook\u2019s algorithm \u2014 to change beliefs is relatively limited. But what has struck me, especially, is how the belief in a stolen election has spread among people I wouldn\u2019t have thought of as particularly Trumpy or super-partisan, who aren\u2019t cable news junkies or intensely online, who didn\u2019t even seem that invested in the election before it happened. Others have taken note of the same phenomenon: At National Review, Michael Brendan Dougherty writes that \u201cfriends who I did not know were political are sending me little snippets of allegations of voter fraud and manipulation.\u201d At The American Mind, the pseudonymous Californian Peachy Keenan describes watching a passel of lukewarm Trump-supporter moms in her Catholic parish suddenly \u201cget MAGAfied\u201d by election conspiracy theories. (As a fraud believer herself, she thinks that\u2019s a good thing.) Drawn from my conversations in the past few weeks, here\u2019s an attempt at a taxonomy of these unlikely seeming fraud believers. I say \u201cnormie\u201d to reflect the reality that being open to the possibility of conspiracies is itself extremely normal and commonplace. There is nothing unusual, statistically speaking, about believing that a Cold War-era deep state assassinated John F. Kennedy or that the government is concealing evidence of U.F.O.s. Conspiracy theories are common among Democrats as well as Republicans: Witness the polling on Russia\u2019s supposed tampering with vote totals in 2016 or George W. Bush\u2019s supposed foreknowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks; recall the voting-machine theory spun to explain John Kerry\u2019s narrow defeat in 2004. This means you don\u2019t need a complex story about Facebook or Fox News to understand why a person who isn\u2019t intensely political might nonetheless be open to the idea that an election settled by tens of thousands of votes in a few key states was actually fixed for the winner. That kind of openness is just human nature \u2014 and not the worst part of human nature, either, given that conspiracies and cover-ups exist (the military really has been hiding weird evidence of U.F.O.s!) and even wrongheaded theories often partake of a reasonable skepticism about elite malfeasance, from the Gulf of Tonkin era to the Jeffrey Epstein case. What\u2019s happened in the past month with our open-minded normie, though, is that this openness has been validated by the president of the United States and his retainers in a way that other forms of conspiracy curiosity are not. There is a longstanding pattern in both political parties of gently encouraging conspiracizing. (The Diebold-stole-Ohio theories in 2004 were given oxygen by prominent congressional Democrats; MSNBC\u2019s Russiagate coverage was not exactly cautious in the theories that it entertained.) But Trump is obviously different \u2014 higher-profile and more radical. He\u2019s a president, not a cable-TV host or a congressman, and he\u2019s shouting allegations, any allegations, with no pussyfooting, hedging or deniability involved. If you are biased against conspiracy theories, this shouting is ridiculous. If you\u2019re somewhat open toward them, though, and somewhat right-of-center, it provides encouragement. It\u2019s not that the curious normie listens to Trump and thinks that everything he says is true. It\u2019s that Trump is providing validation for the belief that something might be true, that where there are so many claims of fraud a few might be accurate, that where there\u2019s so much smoke there might be a blaze or two as well. Of course there are also lots of pure Trump loyalists who trust his claims absolutely, and a certain number of QAnon-type fantasists who embrace any theory no matter how baroque. But the voter-fraud narrative is pervasive on the right because you don\u2019t have to be a loyalist or a fantasist to take something from Trump\u2019s rants \u2014 not belief itself, but the permission to believe. The next category of believer consists of extremely smart people whose self-identification is bound up in constantly questioning and doubting official forms of knowledge. Conservatism has always had plenty of this sort in its ranks, but the consolidated progressive orthodoxy in elite institutions means that more and more people come to conservative ideas because they seem like a secret knowledge, an account of the world that\u2019s compelling and yet excluded from official discourse. This, in turn, instills a perpetual suspicion about anything that seems to have too much of a liberal consensus defending it, especially any idea that gets mocked and laughed at more than it gets rebutted. And it creates a strong epistemological bias toward what you can only find out for yourself, as opposed to what Yale\u2019s experts or Twitter\u2019s warning labels or The New York Times might tell you. In many cases the outsider-intellectual\u2019s approach generates real insight. (Anonymous right-wing Twitter was way out ahead of the coronavirus threat, for instance, at a time when official liberalism was still fretting more about xenophobia than the virus itself.) But it also tends to recapitulate the closed-circle problems of the official knowledge it rejects. Thus the outsider-intellectual type looks at the no-voter-fraud consensus and immediately goes out in search of cracks in the pillar of official truth, anomalies that official certainty elides. A lot of the supposed evidence of fraud that circulates online comes from these efforts \u2014 not from grifts or lies (though grifters and liars do pick them up) but from sincere analyses of election data, which inevitably turn up anomalies here and there, which confirm the searchers\u2019 assumptions, which closes the circle and convinces them that the official narrative is false and voter fraud is real. This final camp includes many of the people reading and circulating the outsider-intellectual analyses \u2014 people on the right whose perceptions of what liberal institutions and actors are capable of doing have been altered by the coronavirus era. Many liberals have spent the Trump years worried about a kind of Reichstag Fire moment, a crisis that Trump might use as an excuse to consolidate authoritarianism. But a lot of conservatives experienced May and June of the Covid era as a mirror image of those anti-Trump fears \u2014 as a crisis that seemed to be deliberately exploited for revolutionary purposes by politicians and activists of the left. Their story of the spring and early summer starts with our country\u2019s leaders and experts calling for unprecedented sacrifice, with lockdowns and closures that disproportionately affected small businesses, churches and families with children \u2014 all conservative-coded groups and institutions \u2014 while liberal professionals on Zoom were in better shape and the great powers of Silicon Valley expanded their influence and wealth. Then, based on a single activist-amplified case of police brutality, the same experts and politicians suddenly abandoned restrictions for the sake of left-wing protests \u2026 which the official media pretended were peaceful even when they cut a violent swathe through American cities \u2026 which included a wave of iconoclasm against key symbols of American history \u2026 even as a new ideological vocabulary seemed to suddenly take over elite institutions \u2026 and dissenting figures were purged \u2026 and in the background the world\u2019s elites loudly announced that they were seeking a \u201cGreat Reset,\u201d a post-coronavirus new world order. For the radicalized, all this felt stage-managed, prearranged \u2014 both as a further escalation in the establishment\u2019s battle against Trump, a successor to the Mueller investigation and the impeachment push, and as an attempt to use the weirdness of the Covid situation to consolidate radical power within elite institutions. Experiencing and interpreting the summer of 2020 this way primed people to expect further escalation in the fall: After all, if liberals exploited a pandemic to stage-manage an ideological revolution, why wouldn\u2019t they exploit all the weird features of pandemic voting to stage-manage the election outcome? No doubt some of my liberal readers will find this question too ridiculous to even merit an answer. You can\u2019t argue someone out of a conspiracy theory, a common axiom goes, which means the only appropriate response to these ideas is condemnation and a kind of quarantine \u2014 to be achieved, presumably, through better Facebook algorithms, the comprehensive political defeat of the Republican Party and some sort of \u201chave you no sense of decency, sir\u201d courage from news anchors and political leaders whenever right-wing paranoia re-emerges. I don\u2019t see any way that these efforts will work. (Certainly on the evidence of 2020, the Republican Party isn\u2019t going anywhere, let alone about to be \u201cburned to the ground\u201d as some anti-Trumpers hoped.) Of course the alternative \u2014 actually trying to argue with people in the camps I\u2019ve just described \u2014 may not work either, especially given the curated virtual realities that the internet increasingly enables us all to inhabit. But I\u2019ve been argued in and out of a few outr\u00e9 theories in my life. (Only the best outr\u00e9 theories, I assure you.) And if you accept that there\u2019s more reasoning involved in conspiracy theorizing than official wisdom suggests, then once such theories achieve a certain prominence, there\u2019s an obligation to actually make the case against them rather than just laugh them away. My own attempts at argument have run as follows: To the conspiracy-curious Republican whose curiosity is validated by Trump\u2019s allegations of fraud, I\u2019ve suggested that the place to look for fire amid the smoke is in claims that the president\u2019s lawyers are actually willing to advance in court, as opposed to in news conferences, semiofficial hearings and on Twitter. Those lawyers \u2014 especially now that it\u2019s mostly just the Rudy Giuliani show \u2014 have every incentive to blow a fraud case wide open. If their legal claims don\u2019t actually allege fraud or they fall apart under scrutiny, then so should your assumption that the president\u2019s blustering must have some real-world correlative. To the outsider-intellectuals fascinated by anomalies in ballot counts or ballot return patterns, I\u2019ve argued that anomalies indicating fraud would have to show up in the final vote totals \u2014 meaning some pattern of results in key swing-state cities that differ starkly from the results in cities in less-contested states, or some turnout pattern in a swing state\u2019s suburbs that looks weird relative to the suburbs in a deep- blue or deep-red state. But where claims for those kinds of anomalies have been offered, they\u2019ve turned out to be false. So until a compelling example can be cited, anomalies in the counting process should be presumed to be error or randomness, not fraud. Finally to the radicalized, I\u2019ve tried to convey, based on my own knowledge of how liberal institutions work, that what looked stage-managed to outsiders in the May and June disturbances actually reflected organic upheaval and division, sincere antiracism and disorganized Trump-phobia, a crisis in the mind of liberalism, a dose of religious revival, plus a chaotic revolt by city-dwellers against a lockdown experience that fell heavily on them. Hypocrisy and radicalism alike there was in plenty, but literally nobody was in charge, except sometimes for activists in the younger generation who sensed a professional opportunity, and any supposed \u201cplan\u201d or \u201creset\u201d was just a hapless attempt by elder statesmen to get woke. Put more succinctly: The liberal establishment that I watched stagger through May and June could not plan a sweeping voter-fraud conspiracy to save its life. Have I persuaded anyone with these arguments? Maybe not, and as a columnist for a noted establishment organ, I\u2019m probably not the best person to make them anyway. That distinction belongs to people more enmeshed in the conservative universe, scribes for National Review and talk-radio hosts and conservative media critics, all of whom are the more important arguers for an intra-Republican debate. But I am certain that these issues are connected to a larger and more important question for the future of the right. At the moment, the voter-fraud narrative is being deployed, often by people more cynical than the groups I\u2019ve just described, to help an outgoing president \u2014 one who twice lost the popular vote and displayed gross incompetence in the face of his administration\u2019s greatest challenge \u2014 stake a permanent claim to the leadership of his party and establish himself as the presumptive Republican nominee in 2024. And it\u2019s being used to push aside the more compelling narrative that the Republican Party could take away from 2020, which is that Trump\u2019s presidency demonstrated that populism can provide a foundation for conservatism, but to build on it the right needs a very different leader than the man Joe Biden just defeated. That\u2019s the most important argument for the next four years \u2014 and one I\u2019ll be making firmly, passionately, right up until the Republican Party nominates Trump again in 2024.

    "article_text": "\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 Parodies Rudy Giuliani and Melissa Carone\u2019s Disastrous Hearing The emergence of a new public figure in the political sphere is a precious moment for fans of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d one that often sets off a guessing game of which cast member (or, lately, which celebrity guest star) will be playing that person by the weekend. Who would make the best Brett Kavanaugh? The perfect Robert Mueller? The ideal Dr. Anthony Fauci? So last week at a Michigan House hearing, after Rudy Giuliani helped introduce audiences to Melissa Carone, a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems with an assertive confidence in her unverified claims of voter fraud that a Wayne County judge had already described as \u201csimply not credible,\u201d viewers of \u201cS.N.L.\u201d went into action. In particular, the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d faithful couldn\u2019t help but draw comparisons between Carone\u2019s distinctive cadence and the speech patterns of the Girl You Wish You Hadn\u2019t Started a Conversation With at a Party, the recurring character played by Cecily Strong. And sure enough, Strong took center stage in this weekend\u2019s opening sketch, playing Carone in a parody of the Michigan hearing. The sketch also featured Kate McKinnon as an audibly flatulent Giuliani, who told the legislators that he and President Trump planned to keep contesting election results: \u201cFirst in Michigan, then in Georgylvania, and then Pennsachusetts and then North Dacanada,\u201d she said. McKinnon added that she would introduce \u201ca dozen highly intelligent, barely intoxicated individuals who are all eyewitnesses.\u201d That parade began with Strong, as Carone, who emphatically told the House members: \u201cExcuse me, maybe try losing the attitude first. Just like you lost all those Trump ballots.\u201d More witnesses testified, including Heidi Gardner as a woman who said she ate ballots; Beck Bennett as the My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell; Alex Moffat as the victim of an alien abduction; and Chloe Fineman, playing Nicole Kidman\u2019s character from HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Undoing.\u201d But time and again, the proceedings were interrupted by Strong, who continued to spin conspiracy theories (\u201cI voted for Trump, yet Biden won? Hmmm. Maybe a little too random\u201d) and confused Dominion with Domino\u2019s Pizza. (\u201cWell, for starters they cheated me out of my cheesy bread,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cEither way my vote took longer than 30 minutes so it\u2019s supposed to be free.\u201d) Before wrapping up the hearing (and the sketch), McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani vowed: \u201cI would say the defense rests, but we will never rest. Not until this election is overturned. Or I get a full pardon and $10 million in cash.\u201d It took a moment for the premise of this filmed segment to become clear: Santa Claus (played by Jason Bateman, the evening\u2019s host) and his elves (Bennett, Fineman and Kyle Mooney) read through letters from children before they come across a disturbing request from an especially dedicated Santa fan. That fan is Stu (Pete Davidson), who raps his Christmas wish as an homage to Eminem\u2019s \u201cStan\u201d: I won\u2019t be greedy or needy or ask you for too much.Just want one thing and hope you still got that magic touch.\u2018Cause getting this present is the only thing keeping me alive.Dear Santa Claus: Please bring me a PS5. The sketch also features McKinnon in the role of Dido, Eminem\u2019s collaborator on the original song; Bowen Yang as Elton John, who famously sang a duet of \u201cStan\u201d with Eminem at the 2001 Grammys; and stick around till the very end for one last surprise cameo. At the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che riffed on President Trump\u2019s failed efforts to overturn his election loss and on the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. Jost began: Yesterday, Trump\u2019s lawyers opened another door on their advent calendar of losing as they had election lawsuits tossed in six different states. Proving once again that this administration will never stop fighting \u2014 except the coronavirus. In a psychotic OnlyFans video this week, Trump said that this was a rigged election at the highest level. Dude, you\u2019re the highest level. You were in charge when the election happened. And hey, look, I will believe any conspiracy theory you want, as long as in 44 days, you leave. I will believe there were suitcases of hidden ballots. I\u2019ll believe that the votes were counted illegally in Spain. Or \u2014 this is a real theory \u2014 that North Koreans in ships dropped off ballots in Maine. Because, you know, it\u2019s easier for North Koreans to get to the East Coast. Whatever you want us to believe, sir, I am in. OK? I see you, you is smart. You is kind. You is important. But you is need to go. Che continued: The C.D.C. has recommended that the first people in the U.S. to receive Covid vaccines should be health care workers and residents of nursing homes, while the first people to actually receive it will be guests of Colin and Scarlett\u2019s holiday yacht party. I got mixed feelings on this vaccine. On one hand, I\u2019m Black, so naturally, I don\u2019t really trust it. But on the other hand, I\u2019m on a white TV show so I might actually get the real one. Speaking from the Weekend Update desk, Davidson, a well-known native of Staten Island, riffed on a recent protest at Mac\u2019s Public House, a tavern there whose owner declared the bar an \u201cautonomous zone\u201d in a rebellion against pandemic restrictions. \u201cPeople were outside the bar, shouting about freedom, taunting the cops, chanting that they should arrest the governor,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s Staten Island, so I assume that it was just a typical last call.\u201d Davidson added that a protester had \u201ccompared not being able to drink indoors to being Jewish during the Holocaust, which must have been awkward for the people there who had to suddenly pretend they believed in the Holocaust.\u201d Davidson also wondered why so many Twitter users were decrying a charity table-reading of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d in which he will read James Stewart\u2019s role of George Bailey. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-timey film about a guy who\u2019s suicidal,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cI\u2019m famously depressed and have the complexion of someone in a black-and-white movie.\u201d The country musician Morgan Wallen was previously scheduled to appear on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d in October, but he lost that booking after several videos posted to social media showed him celebrating a University of Alabama football victory in ways that violated the show\u2019s coronavirus protocols. Two months later, Wallen was back to perform on the program and he also appeared in this sketch, in which he poked fun at his shortsighted actions. Wallen played himself, carousing at an Alabama bar, where his future self (Bateman) appeared in a puff of smoke and advised him that his actions would cost him his \u201cS.N.L.\u201d spot.

    "article_text": "At Rally for Georgia Senators, Trump Focuses on His Own Grievances VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 One month before a pair of Georgia runoffs that will determine the Senate majority, President Trump used a rally for the Republican senators on Saturday to complain about his own loss last month, insisting he would still prevail and, with notably less ardor, encouraging voters here to re-elect the two lawmakers. Taking the stage for his first rally as a lame duck president, Mr. Trump immediately, and falsely, claimed victory in the presidential race. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump lost this state by just under 12,000 votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the White House with 306 electoral votes. But the president has persisted in his baseless claims that the final outcome remains in doubt. \u201cThey cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we\u2019ll still win,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence but nonetheless prompting about 10,000 supporters gathered on the tarmac at a regional airport to chant, \u201cStop the Steal!\u201d Speaking for an hour and 40 minutes, the president did read a series of scripted lines about the two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and repeatedly urged his supporters in Georgia to vote next month, even mentioning the deadlines for the mail-in ballots he has so often scorned. Yet he embedded those dutiful remarks of support in a deep thicket of conspiracy-mongering about his defeat and even aired a lengthy montage of video of clips from the conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network, which also depicted a sinister plot of electoral theft. Before he arrived in Valdosta, the president made no attempt to disguise his central priority as it relates to Georgia: overturning his loss in the state. He began the day with a telephone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, ostensibly to offer his condolences to the governor about the death in a car accident of a young man who was close to Mr. Kemp\u2019s family. But in truth, Mr. Trump used the call to urge Mr. Kemp, a Republican, to call the state legislature into session so the G.O.P. majorities could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. He has also called on Mr. Kemp to order an audit of signatures on ballots. At the rally, Mr. Trump amplified the critique he had been making of Mr. Kemp much of the day on Twitter, all but demanding that the governor overturn the will of the voters for him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cStop it very easily.\u201d The crowd booed when he invoked Mr. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the two Georgia Republicans Mr. Trump has been demanding abet his effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. And they cheered when he turned to Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican and Trump loyalist, and suggested he challenge Mr. Kemp in a gubernatorial primary in 2022. The president called the January races \u201cthe most important congressional runoff probably in American history\u201d and lashed the Democratic nominees, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as \u201cfar-left liberals.\u201d But he didn\u2019t unspool the most biting attacks on them until about an hour into his remarks, and it was later still that he brought Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to the stage for brief remarks. Mr. Perdue was nearly drowned out by the audience, which showered him with a \u201cFight for Trump\u201d chant that only grew louder when the two candidates handed the microphone back to the president. The president\u2019s supporters will not tolerate anything less than total fealty toward him. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent lament about what he described as the \u201crigged\u201d election illustrated the quandary for Republicans. With Mr. Trump sowing distrust in Georgia\u2019s voting system, railing against the vote-counting machines the state used and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud, he\u2019s giving Republicans in the state reason to question both voting by mail and in-person voting. If that prompts even a modest number of Republicans to sit out the Senate runoffs, especially in rural areas where Mr. Trump\u2019s support is strongest, it could be enough to alter the electoral math in the evenly divided state and tip the races to the Democrats. The president repeatedly sought to encourage Georgians to participate in the runoffs in the same breaths in which he railed against his own loss, offering a jarring, two-speeches-in-one presentation. \u201cYou got to get out and vote,\u201d he said just moments after venting that Republicans were purportedly \u201cnot nearly as vicious\u201d as Democrats when it came to stealing elections. In Valdosta, 250 miles south of Atlanta, supporters of the president began arriving by noon for the evening rally. Many of them had crossed the nearby state line from Florida and thus could not vote in the Senate races. The music, the red-white-and-blue stagecraft and Mr. Trump\u2019s heavily anticipated arrival were all familiar. But he showed little joy, and much of his speech was dedicated to nursing his grievances and was often reminiscent of the rambling, misinformation-filled, 45-minute video he delivered from the White House earlier in the week. \u201cI got more votes than any sitting president in history,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president\u2019s willingness to campaign Saturday night in heavily conservative South Georgia \u2014 far from the Atlanta-area voters who rejected him last month \u2014 heartened Republican officials, who have been lobbying him to intervene in the runoffs in support of Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue. But aides worried, presciently, in the days leading to the appearance that he would go off script and attack Mr. Kemp, who has become the primary target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter vitriol. Hoping to pacify Mr. Trump after Saturday\u2019s phone call, Mr. Kemp noted on Twitter that he had already called for an audit of the signatures on mail ballots \u201cto restore confidence in our election process.\u201d But Mr. Kemp\u2019s office has also said the governor does not have the power to unilaterally order a signature audit. Mr. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night because of the death of the family friend. Before Mr. Trump landed in Valdosta, Republicans took pains to emphasize the task at hand: the January runoffs. A mammoth video screen directed attendees to \u201cRequest Your Absentee Ballot Right Now!\u201d and directed them to the website to do so. And Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue both addressed the audience well before Air Force One touched down on a mild late autumn night. During a speech by Ms. Loeffler, who addressed the crowd nearly two hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the \u201cStop the steal\u201d chant broke out in the audience \u2014 in the cadence of the familiar \u201cLock her up\u201d chants that were popular during Mr. Trump\u2019s first run. Ms. Loeffler sought to redirect the crowd\u2019s energy to the runoff elections and away from the president\u2019s attempts to subvert the election results. \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you vote, we will win. If you don\u2019t, we will lose America and what it\u2019s founded on.\u201d But as Elton John\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u201d blared in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, it was far from clear whom the crowd was more intent on directing its hostility toward \u2014 Democrats or the Georgia Republicans the president is scapegoating for his loss in the state. And outside the event, there were few indicators that the purpose of the rally was to elect Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators. Trump signs were ubiquitous, and the merchandisers outside were selling only Trump gear. The challenge for Republicans was evident in remarks from Mr. Perdue, who veered between encouraging the thousands in attendance to vote in the upcoming runoff and defending Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to advance his claims of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for this president until he gets every ballot counted correctly and every illegal ballot thrown out,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. At the same time, he framed January\u2019s runoffs as a final chance for Republicans to issue a check against a Democratic administration. \u201cIf we win Georgia, we save America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks to you, we\u2019ll make sure the road to socialism never goes through the state of Georgia.\u201d Many in the audience had not accepted that Mr. Biden would be the next president. Jason Kresckey, who attended the rally with his wife, said he wanted to show support for the president. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that whole movement that he created was a movement that inspired a certain population of people. I just don\u2019t think that feeling is going anywhere soon.\u201d Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s Final Days of Rage and Denial WASHINGTON \u2014 Over the past week, President Trump posted or reposted about 145 messages on Twitter lashing out at the results of an election he lost. He mentioned the coronavirus pandemic now reaching its darkest hours four times \u2014 and even then just to assert that he was right about the outbreak and the experts were wrong. Moody and by accounts of his advisers sometimes depressed, the president barely shows up to work, ignoring the health and economic crises afflicting the nation and largely clearing his public schedule of meetings unrelated to his desperate bid to rewrite the election results. He has fixated on rewarding friends, purging the disloyal and punishing a growing list of perceived enemies that now includes Republican governors, his own attorney general and even Fox News. The final days of the Trump presidency have taken on the stormy elements of a drama more common to history or literature than a modern White House. His rage and detached-from-reality refusal to concede defeat evoke images of a besieged overlord in some distant land defiantly clinging to power rather than going into exile or an erratic English monarch imposing his version of reality on his cowed court. And while he will leave office in 46 days, the last few weeks may only foreshadow what he will be like after he departs. Mr. Trump will almost certainly try to shape the national conversation from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and his relentless campaign to discredit the election could undercut his successor, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Although many Republicans would like to move on, he appears intent on forcing them to remain in thrall to his need for vindication and vilification even after his term expires. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump took his unreality show to Georgia for his first major public appearance since the Nov. 3 election. A rally to support two Republican senators in a runoff next month offered a high-profile opportunity to vent his grievances and promote his false claims that he was somehow cheated of a second term by a vast conspiracy. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he told supporters in a state that he lost by 12,000 votes, adding that he actually won other states where in fact he lost too. \u201cThey cheated and they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it,\u201d he declared as he pressured Republican state officials to overturn the results. \u201cWe just need somebody with courage to do what they have to do.\u201d At times, Mr. Trump\u2019s railing-against-his-fate outbursts seem like a story straight out of William Shakespeare, part tragedy, part farce, full of sound and fury. Is Mr. Trump a modern-day Julius Caesar, forsaken by even some of his closest courtiers? (Et tu, Bill Barr?) Or a King Richard III who wars with the nobility until being toppled by Henry VII? Or King Lear, railing against those who do not love and appreciate him sufficiently? How sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth it is to have a thankless electorate. \u201cThis is classic Act V behavior,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Wilson, a Shakespearean scholar at Harvard who published the book \u201cShakespeare and Trump\u201d this year. \u201cThe forces are being picked off and the tyrant is holed up in his castle and he\u2019s growing increasingly anxious and he feels insecure and he starts blustering about his legitimate sovereignty and he starts accusing the opposition of treason.\u201d Others hear echoes from the East, recalling autocrats in the far reaches of the former Soviet Union barricading themselves in presidential palaces while furiously spinning out enemies-of-the-people propaganda to justify holding onto power after popular uprisings. Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis and a Russia scholar, said Mr. Trump reminded her of President Vladimir V. Putin, who has largely withdrawn from view recently amid public discontent in the late stages of an aging regime. \u201cBoth also seem to be living in alternate realities surrounded only by those who confirm those realities,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whereas one brooder will weather a slow and long decline, the other is increasingly facing a rapid decline and scrambling to do what he can to save his family and loyalists \u2014 and of course himself.\u201d Students of the American presidency, on the other hand, could think of no recent parallel. \u201cAs we move toward Inauguration Day, I have thought almost daily of a remark attributed to Henry Adams: \u2018I expected the worst, and it was worse than I expected,\u2019\u201d said Patricia O\u2019Toole, a biographer of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as well as Adams. Unlike any of his modern predecessors, Mr. Trump has not called his victorious opponent, much less invited him to the White House for the traditional postelection visit. Mr. Trump has indicated that he may not attend Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, which would make him the first sitting president since 1869 to refuse to participate in the most important ritual of the peaceful transfer of power. He has been enabled by Republican leaders unwilling to stand up to him, even if many privately wish he would go away sooner rather than later. After being called \u201cprofiles in cowardice\u201d by an ally of the president, 75 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania on Friday disavowed their own election and called on Congress to reject the state\u2019s electors for Mr. Biden. Only 27 of 249 Republican members of Congress surveyed by The Washington Post publicly acknowledged Mr. Biden\u2019s victory. Mr. Trump condemned them on Saturday as \u201cRINOS,\u201d meaning Republicans in name only. \u201cHe really has paid attention to the base,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, a friend of the president\u2019s and chief executive of Newsmax, part of the conservative news media megaphone that has amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations. \u201cThey got him elected and in his mind got him elected the second time. And they\u2019re strongly in favor of this recount effort and they want him to continue this. In his mind, he\u2019s not just doing this for himself he\u2019s doing it for his supporters and for the country. He\u2019s on a mission and he\u2019s not going to be easily swayed.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a fire hose of denial. \u201cNO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION,\u201d he wrote at one point in recent days. \u201cWe won Michigan by a lot!\u201d he wrote at another of a state he lost by more than 154,000 votes. He reposted a message seeking to delegitimize Mr. Biden: \u201cIf he is inaugurated under these circumstances, he cannot be considered \u2018president\u2019 but instead referred to as the #presidentialoccupant.\u201d And he has turned on his own party, angry that Republican leaders have refused to accept his baseless claims and overturn the will of the voters. Shortly before arriving in Georgia on Saturday, Mr. Trump called Gov. Brian Kemp to press him to convene a special legislative session to supplant the results there, then lashed out at the governor at the rally for rebuffing him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He also tweeted that Mr. Kemp and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, another Republican stalwart, \u201cfight harder against us than do the Radical Left Dems.\u201d He has been riled that his invented claims have been widely refuted. \u201cMany people in the media \u2014 and even judges \u2014 so far have refused to accept it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a rambling 46-minute videotaped rant from the White House this past week. \u201cThey know it\u2019s true. They know it\u2019s there. They know who won the election, but they refuse to say you\u2019re right. Our country needs somebody to say, \u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 \u201d But even as the president desperately demands that somebody, anybody, tell him that he is right, no one in a position of authority has done so other than blood relatives, paid lawyers and partisan soul mates. The election has been certified and accepted not just by Democrats but also by key Republican governors, secretaries of state, election officials, city clerks, judges and even Trump administration officials. After his own cybersecurity czar endorsed the integrity of the election, Mr. Trump fired him. Now that Attorney General William P. Barr has said he saw no fraud that would overturn the results, he may be next. Mr. Trump\u2019s video was so out of touch with the facts that both Facebook and Twitter appended warning notices lest viewers actually believe what the president of the United States was telling them. Which explains why the only topic other than the election to draw Mr. Trump\u2019s interest over the last week was the annual defense bill that he vowed to veto because Congress did not strip legal protection for big technology companies as he has demanded. By contrast, he expressed little interest in the coronavirus now ravaging the country or the resulting economic devastation. Rather than \u201crounding the corner,\u201d as Mr. Trump insisted once again on Saturday night, the pandemic this past week began killing a record high of nearly 3,000 people in the United States every day, almost the equivalent of another Sept. 11, 2001, attack every 24 hours. Mr. Trump made no comment on that in his Twitter rants nor about the latest jobs report documenting the economic toll. His only four tweets mentioning the virus were about defending his own handling of it, including reposted messages asserting that \u201cThe president was RIGHT.\u201d As the circle around Mr. Trump shrinks and even allies like Mr. Barr distance themselves, the president resists any suggestion that he stand down. \u201cI\u2019m never, ever going to concede,\u201d he told one ally who urged him to prepare to do so. And if he is not listening to advisers, many are no longer listening to him. At one point, Mr. Trump appeared to telephone Mr. Ducey even as he was certifying Arizona\u2019s results on live television and the governor refused to take the president\u2019s call, which was announced by a \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d ring tone. Top Republican lawyers have dropped off his election lawsuits, which have been dismissed by the dozens and even in one case declared \u201cbizarre\u201d by a judge appointed by Mr. Trump. Five courts in five battleground states rejected his latest legal challenges to the election in a little more than three hours on Friday, with a Wisconsin judge warning that \u201cthis is a dangerous path we are being asked to tread.\u201d Sliding further from the mainstream, the president has aligned himself more with fringe news outlets like One America News Network and the conspiracy theorists of QAnon, who believe the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles plotting against Mr. Trump. In a meeting with Republican senators, according to an official confirming a report in The Post, Mr. Trump said QAnon followers \u201cbasically believe in good government,\u201d a comment that left the room silent until his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, volunteered that he had never heard them described that way. With six weeks until he leaves office, Mr. Trump remains as unpredictable and erratic as ever. He may fire Mr. Barr or others, issue a raft of pardons to protect himself and his allies or incite a confrontation overseas. Like King Lear, he may fly into further rages and find new targets for his wrath. \u201cIf there are these analogies between classic literature and society as it\u2019s operating right now, then that should give us some big cause for concern this December,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, the Shakespearean scholar. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching the end of the play here and that\u2019s where catastrophe always comes.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Judge Orders Government to Fully Reinstate DACA Program A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore an Obama-era program designed to shield young, undocumented immigrants from deportation, dealing what could be a final blow to President Trump\u2019s long-fought effort to end the protections. The program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was created by President Barack Obama in 2012. Over the years, it has protected more than 800,000 individuals, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d who met a series of strict requirements for eligibility. But those protections have been under legal and political siege from Republicans for years, leaving the immigrants who were enrolled in DACA uncertain whether the threat of deportation from the United States could quickly return with a single court order or presidential memorandum. Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn directed the administration on Friday to allow newly eligible immigrants to file new applications for protection under the program, reversing a memorandum issued in the summer by Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, which restricted the program to people who were already enrolled. As many as 300,000 new applicants could now be eligible, according to the lawyers who pushed for the reinstatement. The memo from the Department of Homeland Security also limited benefits under the program, including permits to work, to one year, but the judge ordered the government to restore them to a full two years. Judge Garaufis, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, also said the government must find a way to contact all immigrants who are eligible for the program to inform them of the change. The judge said the government must announce the changes to the program on its website by Monday. Lawyers who had challenged the Trump administration in the case celebrated the decision, saying that amid a pandemic and global economic recession, it granted some stability to a vulnerable group. \u201cThis is a really big day for DACA recipients and immigrant young people,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, director of the Justice Action Center, who litigated the class-action case. \u201cIt\u2019s a day that many of them have been waiting for for over three years.\u201d She said it could open the door for hundreds of thousands of immigrant youths \u201cwho have been unfairly denied their chance\u201d under the DACA program. The program still faces other challenges, including a case in federal court in Texas, where Republican attorneys general have asked a judge to declare it unlawful. And Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could appeal the ruling by Judge Garaufis in the days ahead. Immigration advocates said they hoped the administration would not continue its legal fight to end the program given the arrival of a new, Democratic administration in less than two months. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vowed to restore the DACA program when he takes office, but a legislative solution that would permanently allow the dreamers to live and work legally in the United States remains elusive, leaving their fates to the shifting political winds in Washington. If the judge\u2019s order still stands by the time Mr. Biden takes office in January, the new president would need to do nothing to make good on his promise. But Mr. Biden is certain to face intense pressure from immigrant groups to fight for a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws that would take care of the dreamers and millions of other undocumented immigrants. Comprehensive legislation, including one that would provide a path to citizenship for some immigrants, would be less vulnerable to legal challenges than DACA, which Mr. Obama created using the executive powers of his office after Congress repeatedly refused to act. But securing passage of a bill that includes citizenship for undocumented immigrants could be difficult for Mr. Biden, especially if Republicans still control the Senate after two runoff elections in Georgia early in January. Americans have historically considered DACA beneficiaries to be among the most sympathetic categories of immigrants. Having violated immigration laws through no fault of their own by being brought to the United States as minors, they are required to have a high school diploma or G.E.D., unless they have served in the military, and they must maintain a clean criminal record to hold on to their status. In a Pew survey conducted in June, about three-quarters of respondents, including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, favored extending a pathway to permanent legal status to dreamers. The program has had generational impact. Researchers estimate that 250,000 U.S.-born children have at least one parent who is enrolled in DACA, and that about 1.5 million people in the United States live with a beneficiary of the program. The judge\u2019s ruling on Friday is a significant legal setback to Mr. Trump\u2019s yearslong attempt to terminate the program. As a candidate, Mr. Trump insisted that DACA was unconstitutional, and as president he moved to end it in September 2017. That effort was put on hold by federal judges while the merits of the president\u2019s actions were evaluated. The legal battle culminated in a Supreme Court ruling this summer in which the justices said the president had not followed proper procedures to end the program. In the wake of that ruling, Mr. Wolf only partially reinstated the program, refusing to allow new immigrants to apply and slashing the length of renewals to one year, instead of the two years previously allowed. In November, Judge Garaufis determined that the partial reinstatement was invalid because it had been issued in the form of a memo by Mr. Wolf, who Judge Garaufis found had been unlawfully appointed to his position. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday night. But the administration has disputed the judge\u2019s determination that Mr. Wolf was not properly appointed and has signaled in the past that it intends to fight challenges to the president\u2019s efforts to end or scale back the program.

    "article_text": "Trump Orders All American Troops Out of Somalia WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, pressing his end-of-term troop withdrawals from conflicts around the world, will pull American forces out of Somalia, where they have been trying to push back advances by Islamist insurgents in the Horn of Africa. The Pentagon announced on Friday that virtually all of the approximately 700 troops in Somalia \u2014 most Special Operations forces who have been conducting training and counterterrorism missions \u2014 will be leaving by Jan. 15, five days before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to be inaugurated. The withdrawal from Somalia followed Mr. Trump\u2019s orders to reduce the American presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, and reflected the president\u2019s longstanding desire to end long-running military engagements against Islamist insurgencies in failed and fragile countries in Africa and the Middle East, a grinding mission that has spread since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The debate over the value of counterterrorism and training missions like the one in Somalia, the site of the bloody \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d debacle in 1993, is growing \u2014 among the public, in Congress and even in the Pentagon. Among the points of contention is whether the United States should expend life and treasure for shadowy security operations in remote parts of the world. But Mr. Trump\u2019s push to leave Somalia before he leaves office comes at a delicate time for the East African nation: It is preparing for parliamentary elections next month and a presidential election scheduled for early February. The removal of American troops could complicate any ability to keep election rallies and voting safe from Shabab bombers. It also comes at a time of political turmoil in neighboring Ethiopia, whose army has also battled the Shabab. Supporters of the mission say it is important for the United States to continue strikes on militants and to help train government forces to prevent their territory from becoming a haven for planning terrorist strikes, much like how Al Qaeda plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from a home base in Afghanistan. Even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican allies in Congress have warned against troop cuts in Somalia. \u201cThis strategy has worked, and our continued presence there has prevented Al Shabab from expanding its foothold in the region,\u201d Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement this fall when hints of Mr. Trump\u2019s likely actions surfaced. Many of the American troops will be \u201crepositioned\u201d to nearby Kenya, a Defense Department official said Friday. That means airstrikes by drones on militants in Somalia could continue, but efforts to effectively train local security forces on the ground would end. It was not immediately clear whether other parts of the American presence in Somalia \u2014 such as C.I.A. officers, the ambassador and other State Department diplomats who are based at a heavily fortified bunker at the airport in Mogadishu, the Somali capital \u2014 will also withdraw. The Pentagon pledged that efforts to safeguard American interests would continue. \u201cThe U.S. is not withdrawing or disengaging from Africa,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to our African partners and enduring support through a whole-of-government approach.\u201d The United States will retain the ability to conduct counterterrorism operations in Somalia, especially drone strikes, and to collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the United States and allies from militant forces in the country. \u201cAs a result of this decision, some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cthe remaining forces will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia.\u201d The mission in Somalia has been in the spotlight in recent days, after it was reported that a veteran C.I.A. officer was killed in combat in Somalia, according to current and former American officials. The death has already rekindled debate over American intelligence\u2019s counterterrorism operations in Africa. The officer was a member of the C.I.A.\u2019s paramilitary division, the Special Activities Center, and a former member of the Navy\u2019s elite SEAL Team 6. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump ordered the military to withdraw forces from Afghanistan, halving the number there to just over 2,000. Reductions in the American troop presence in Iraq also are underway. Also this week, the Pentagon policy official overseeing the military\u2019s efforts to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was fired after a White House appointee told him that the United States had won that war and that his office had been disbanded. The ouster of the official, Christopher P. Maier, the chief of the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cDefeat ISIS\u201d task force since March 2017, came just three weeks after Mr. Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and three other Pentagon officials and replaced them with loyalists. The acting defense secretary, Christopher C. Miller, who has been carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s purge at the Pentagon since he took over from Mr. Esper last month, characterized the moves as a reflection of the success of the American-led effort to crush the terrorist state that the Islamic State created in large sections of Iraq and Syria. Defense Department officials familiar with internal deliberations said the Somalia pullout would not apply to American forces stationed in nearby Kenya and Djibouti, where American drones that carry out airstrikes in Somalia are based. Keeping those air bases would mean retaining the military\u2019s ability to use drones to attack militants with the Shabab, a Qaeda-linked terrorist group \u2014 at least those deemed to pose a threat to American interests. Since Mr. Trump ran for office in 2016, exiting foreign conflicts has been a central component of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. That appeal has particularly animated his base of populist voters, many of them veterans who have grown weary of their roles in longstanding wars. The president views his record on the issue as important to any political future he might pursue. Most American troops in Somalia are Special Operations forces stationed at a small number of bases across the country. Their missions include training and advising Somali Army and counterterrorism troops and conducting kill-or-capture raids targeting Shabab militants. The Pentagon has long argued that the United States can safely leave areas contested by militants when the local governments can safeguard their own territory. Mr. Trump\u2019s order means direct training efforts with Somalia security forces would end. For years, Somalia has faced civil war, droughts and violence from Islamist extremists. The United States intervened in the country as peacekeepers, but abandoned it not long after the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d battle in 1993, which killed 18 Americans and hundreds of militia fighters. The Shabab, whose name means \u201cthe youth,\u201d emerged around 2007 and have violently vied for control of Somalia with occasional attacks outside its borders, including a shooting in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, that killed more than five dozen civilians and a deadly assault in January on an American air base at Manda Bay, Kenya. Shabab leaders pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012. In 2016, shortly before leaving office, Obama administration officials deemed them part of the congressionally authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks. Under the Trump administration, the military sharply increased airstrikes targeting Shabab militants.",

Vice President Mike Pence appeared at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday and said the nation was facing a \u201cchallenging time\u201d but also \u201ca season of hope,\u201d with the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine coming as soon as next week. \u201cThank you to the men and women of C.D.C. who have literally poured their lives over the last 10 months into saving lives across America,\u201d said Mr. Pence, who wore a mask during the visit. But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus. The agency also called for increased access to testing and quarantine for those who are exposed. Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers. Two days later, a committee of outside experts will convene to make recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration about whether to grant emergency approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that he would implore Americans to wear masks for a little more than three months toward the beginning of his term. \u201cJust 100 days to mask,\u201d Mr. Biden told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a significant reduction.\u201d  But until he is sworn in on Jan. 20, Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to take direct action is limited.",

    "article_text": "Pelosi voices optimism on stimulus after McConnell agrees to compromise on a year-end spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi flashed fresh optimism on Friday that the House and Senate could soon reach a bipartisan deal on an elusive pandemic stimulus plan after she and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed to try to find an agreement that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package. \u201cThat would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said at a news conference in the Capitol Friday morning, a day after her conversation with Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. The phone call marked their first conversation since the election. Though Ms. Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be \u201csufficient time\u201d to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported on Friday as an added accelerant. \u201cThere is momentum. There is momentum,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed similar resolve on Thursday, although he stopped short of endorsing the $908 billion outline proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates that Ms. Pelosi has said should be the starting point for talks, instead pressing for a far smaller bill. Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like liability protections for businesses, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11, though most involved in the process say that a resolution is feasible before the end of the year. After months of insisting they would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Democrats now appear poised to accept less than one third of the spending they initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs, leaving other priorities unaddressed until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office Jan. 20. The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks, and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine. While a bipartisan group of senators is expected to continue working on finalizing legislative text through the weekend, there remain a number of significant hurdles. The policy divides that have helped derail attempts to reach agreement earlier this year persist even as lawmakers circulate a tentative outline. Pressed on her reversal, Ms. Pelosi was defensive on Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that the Senate called nonstarters were important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Mr. Biden\u2019s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to \u201ca total game-changer.\u201d \u201cPresident-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it, as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to saves lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The President and Pre-Emptive Pardons The power to pardon criminals or commute their sentences is one of the most sacred and absolute a president has, and President Trump has already used it to rescue political allies and answer the pleas of celebrities. So what might he do in the closing days of his administration, when presidents have often made freest use of this power? Mr. Trump has discussed granting three of his children, his son-in-law and his personal lawyer pardons protecting them from charges that have not yet been filed. Such pre-emptive pardons have been a rarity in American history, granted with the stated intention of sparing the nation from dangerous divisions.  We look ahead to a potential wave of pardons and commutations \u2014 and explore who could benefit.  Michael S. Schmidt, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times.  Speculation about pardon activity at the White House is churning furiously, underscoring how much the Trump administration has been dominated by investigations and criminal prosecutions of people in the president\u2019s orbit. The president\u2019s pardoning of Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser, signals the prospect of a wave of pardons and commutations in his final weeks in office.

Even in defeat, President Trump continued to raise money at some of the fastest rates of the year, pulling in $207.5 million in the month since Election Day with the Republican National Committee as he has stoked unfounded fears of election fraud and made baseless claims to undermine the legitimacy of the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus has continued to aggressively solicit donations under the guise of supporting his various legal challenges to the election of Joseph R.

His campaign did not release a breakdown of how the $207.5 million was divided, with funds split between the new PAC, paying off his campaign debts, the R.N.C. and two committees operated jointly by the party and the campaign. \u201cThese tremendous fund-raising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party,\u201d Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who has not formally conceded the 2020 race but has begun talking about running again in 2024, has repeatedly challenged the results in court with virtually no success. In his statement, Mr. Stepien added that the money \u201calso positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022.\u201d The Thursday announcement came on a final filing deadline of the 2020 race with the Federal Election Commission, which covers the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. During that period, the R.N.C., Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and their shared committees raised a combined $495 million, campaign officials announced. As of early evening, only the R.N.C. had filed its report, which showed it ended the period with $58.8 million cash on hand. As Mr. Trump has contested the results in multiple venues, the party had spent more than $6 million on legal bills, with $1.4 million going to the Jones Day law firm, $1.3 million to King and Spalding and more than $920,000 to Consovoy McCarthy.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fed Pick Squeaks Through Senate Confirmation WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Waller, nominated by President Trump to the Federal Reserve\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors, was confirmed by a narrow margin on Thursday as Republican senators scramble to fill open slots before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. assumes office. Mr. Waller, a regional Fed research official, had been up for Senate confirmation alongside Judy Shelton, whose long-held preference for some type of gold standard and apparent skepticism of Fed independence hurt her chances of confirmation. Mr. Waller made it through, but just barely, with a nearly party line vote of 48 to 47. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, joined Democrats in voting against Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller\u2019s selection means that Mr. Biden will take office with a Fed stocked with picks from Mr. Trump, who has now chosen five of the central bank\u2019s six sitting officials, including appointing Jerome H. Powell as its chair. The board will have one remaining open slot if Ms. Shelton is not confirmed. While the sitting governors have varying time left in their 14-year terms, Mr. Waller was appointed to an unexpired slot that stretches through early 2030. The White House announced that it would tap Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton in mid-2019, but their nominations \u2014 long treated as a pair \u2014 faced a roller-coaster confirmation process as senators grappled with misgivings over Ms. Shelton. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a Republican of Kentucky, tried but failed to bring her nomination to a vote in November. Her path to confirmation became even less likely given the changing makeup of the Senate. Senator Mark Kelly, the newly elected Democrat from Arizona, was sworn in this week, and his likely no vote could kill Ms. Shelton\u2019s razor-thin chance of passing, because she already faced opposition from several Republicans. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told reporters that Ms. Shelton\u2019s confirmation is \u201cunlikely\u201d after the changeover.

Jerome Powell was appointed as a governor by President Obama and subsequently appointed as chair by President Trump. Randal K. Quarles served as an acting governor for several months in 2018 pending his renomination. By Eleanor Lutz Though he was a conventional pick for the job, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation passed by the narrowest margin of any governor going back to at least 1980 and probably ever, based on data collected by a George Washington University professor, Sarah Binder. The partisan rancor shows how the process of appointing Fed governors \u2014 once drama free \u2014 has changed over the past decade. Both Mr. Trump and former President Barack Obama struggled to get nominees on the Fed board as political fights have erupted over who should fill seats on the powerful body, which plays a central role in setting interest rates and in shaping financial regulation. It also underlines the unusual path Mr. McConnell took in trying to push Fed officials through confirmation so late in the game. Mr. Waller is the first nominee ever confirmed during a lame-duck session, the period after an election but before a new administration enters the White House, according to the Fed historian Peter Conti-Brown. \u201cEverything has become hyper-politicized, and the Fed is no exception,\u201d said Mark Spindel, who with Ms. Binder wrote a book on politics at and around the Fed. \u201cFilling those spots with Trump appointees just limits what Biden can do.\u201d The Fed\u2019s Washington-based board members hold constant votes on monetary policy, while most of the 12 regional bank presidents rotate in and out of four voting seats. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the exception, holding a permanent vote. The board members, called governors, also vote on the regulations that govern the nation\u2019s largest banks. Interest-rate setting is usually not a partisan exercise, and policy preferences do not split cleanly along ideological lines. But bank oversight tends to be more political, with Republicans favoring lighter oversight and Democrats pushing for more stringent rules. Despite the drama, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation was received as good news by many in the central banking community. He is a seasoned economist who has worked in academia and, most recently, as research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Mr. Waller\u2019s research has covered topics including central bank independence \u2014 \u201cthe key tool to ensure a government will not misuse monetary policy\u201d \u2014 and he has laid out a rationale for keeping borrowing costs cheap when prices are increasing slowly, as they have been in recent years. The Fed raises or lowers interest rates to slow or speed up the economy, hoping to keep inflation slow and stable while maximizing employment. Before joining the Fed in 2009, Mr. Waller was a professor in the economics department at Notre Dame. He has a doctorate from Washington State University. It is not clear whether he will be installed at the Fed in time for the central bank\u2019s Dec. 15-16 meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s been an excellent research director,\u201d Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said of Mr. Waller, calling him an \u201cexcellent economist\u201d with a \u201ckeen mind.\u201d",

    "article_text": "President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.: They Dare Not Speak His Name WASHINGTON \u2014 Funny what passes for a jolting revelation at the Capitol these days. Senator Mitch McConnell had just uttered a sentence that in more normal times would be received \u2014 and quickly forgotten \u2014 as just the kind of drab boilerplate that the Senate majority leader, a Kentucky Republican, is known for. \u201cI think we all know that after the first of the year, there\u2019s likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday as he discussed prospects for a coronavirus relief bill. At which point he delivered his bombshell: \u201cDepending on what the new administration wants to pursue.\u201d Aha! He said \u201cnew administration.\u201d Implying there would be an outgoing president. If President Trump had won re-election, as he keeps insisting \u2014 and which few Republican senators will publicly disabuse him of \u2014 there would be no \u201cnew administration\u201d to speak of. In other words, Mr. McConnell, in his own circuitous and perhaps unintentional way, was acknowledging that Mr. Trump had lost. Maybe he did not mean to be so forthcoming. It is, after all, a delicate verbal dance that Mr. McConnell and many of his fellow Republican senators are engaged in. They do not wish to alienate the apparently significant portion of the party\u2019s base that still believes that Mr. Trump won, or antagonize the president to the point that he torments them with future grudges, tweets and primary challengers from what will become the next de facto Republican home office, Mar-a-Lago. As such, when Mr. McConnell was asked directly about Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims, he reverted to his bland, inscrutable form. \u201cThe future will take care of itself,\u201d he said. This would seem beyond dispute. Privately, pretty much all Republican senators acknowledge that yes, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20. This includes even Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who admitted as much to Mark Becker, a former Republican official in the state. Mr. Becker recounted a conversation he had had with Mr. Johnson on Wednesday in The Bulwark, a website with a heavy bent toward \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatism. When Mr. Becker asked Mr. Johnson why he had never acknowledged this election result in public, Mr. Johnson explained that to do so would be \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d (It appears likely that Mr. Johnson believed this conversation was private.) In recent weeks, the unwillingness of most Senate and House Republicans to acknowledge an obvious election result has reached new levels of absurd. Whenever another prominent Republican official admits that Mr. Biden in fact won, the media updates the scoreboard like it\u2019s breaking news \u2014 as if a new state had been called on election night. Senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins declared this early, as did former President George W. Bush, his brother Jeb Bush, and a bunch of Republican governors and members of Congress. To reiterate what should now be indisputable: Mr. Biden won the election. Every serious news outlet in the United States has declared it. Nearly every lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has filed disputing results in multiple states has failed \u2014 laughably in many cases. and Attorney General William P. Barr announced Tuesday that he had seen zero proof of fraud that would meaningfully affect the outcome. (Mr. Trump is reportedly furious at Mr. Barr for saying this.) Mr. Biden has received nearly seven million more votes than Mr. Trump, and he has amassed an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, with virtually all ballots counted. It appeared last Sunday that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, had joined the ranks of the sky-is-blue caucus when he referred to the \u201cBiden administration\u201d in an interview with CNN. This was of added significance because Mr. Blunt is the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees inaugural activities. \u201cWe are working with the Biden administration,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cLikely administration,\u201d he corrected himself. Ms. Bash pressed Mr. Blunt on whether this meant Mr. Biden was in fact the \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Not so fast, he said. \u201cWell, the president-elect will be the president-elect when the electors vote for him,\u201d Mr. Blunt said, referring to the meeting of the Electoral College that is scheduled for Dec. 14. \u201cThere is no official job of president-elect,\u201d Mr. Blunt explained, though this had not stopped him from congratulating \u201cPresident-elect\u201d Donald J. Trump in a statement the day after Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. In lieu of explicitly saying that Mr. Biden won, most Republicans are at least willing to engage in public discourse predicated on that reality. They have, for instance, repeatedly said that the two Senate seats up for grabs in a Georgia runoff election next month would determine which party controlled the chamber. If both Republican incumbents, Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, lose, the Senate would be 50-50, and Democrats would win the majority \u2014 an assumption premised on Senator Kamala Harris becoming the vice president and presiding over the Senate and being tasked with breaking tied votes. Several have weighed in on Mr. Biden\u2019s cabinet nominees. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, deemed the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, \u201cradioactive.\u201d Mr. Cornyn also lamented that Mr. Biden\u2019s team had not sought \u201cconsultation\u201d from Republicans before making the choice (which would of course not be necessary if Mr. Biden had lost and was just spitballing). Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to suggest a few good candidates to be the next secretary of agriculture \u201cif Biden becomes pres.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence even made the trip to Capitol Hill to swear in the newly elected Democratic senator from Arizona, Mark Kelly, while Mr. Pence\u2019s boss continued to rail against the results in that state (which were formally certified Monday). When asked after Mr. Kelly\u2019s swearing-in whether this meant he accepted the election results, Mr. Pence did not respond to reporters. Things get trickier when Republicans are asked directly whether they accept the results of the election, as reporters have been pressing them to do pretty much daily since Nov. 3. In normal times (how long before we retire that qualifier?), this question would yield some variation on the same obvious and broadly accepted response: \u201cYes.\u201d Alas, these are not normal times. \u201cThis has not been a conventional presidency,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, summarized for reporters when he was asked why he and other Republicans have not raised concerns about the president\u2019s repeated and false claims that the election was \u201crigged\u201d or \u201cstolen.\u201d Since Mr. Trump was sworn in, Republicans have repeatedly sought verbal refuge in the \u201cunconventional\u201d nature of this presidency. This has been something of a blanket response to questions about his latest incendiary conduct. From Day 1, these statements have involved a willingness to indulge \u201calternative facts,\u201d as Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said in defense of the untrue assertion by Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period.\u201d In other words, an administration that began with a whopping assertion of \u201calternative facts\u201d is concluding with similarly outlandish claims about an alternative election result.

    "article_text": "New U.S. Citizenship Test Is Longer and More Difficult The Trump administration is rolling out sweeping changes to the test immigrants must take to become United States citizens, injecting hints of conservative philosophy and making the test harder for many learners of the English language. The new citizenship test that went into effect on Tuesday is longer than before, with applicants now required to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly instead of six out of 10. It is also more complex, eliminating simple geography and adding dozens of possible questions, some nuanced and involving complex phrasing, that could trip up applicants who do not consider them carefully. Of the 18 questions removed from the previous test, 11 were questions that had simple, sometimes one-word answers. The new test adds one more hurdle for immigrants who hope to become voting citizens, coming in the waning days of an administration that has imposed substantial new barriers to immigration and limits on the ability of those already in the country to aspire to legal residence and, eventually, naturalization. One test question that has drawn particular scrutiny provides a new answer to the question, \u201cWho does a U.S. Senator represent?\u201d Previously, the answer was \u201call people of the state\u201d; on the new test, it is \u201ccitizens\u201d in the state. Singled out for a new question is the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states all powers not specifically granted to the federal government, a part of the Bill of Rights that is a favorite among conservatives questioning federal authority. Another new question, \u201cWhy did the United States enter the Vietnam War?\u201d has one answer that is considered correct: \u201cto stop the spread of Communism.\u201d The test does not take on the issue of the vehement protests or the huge death toll stemming from the war. Immigration organizations, including some that have helped thousands of people complete their naturalization applications over the past decade, warn that the new test could make it harder for poor immigrants from non-English-speaking countries to become citizens and ultimately suppress the number of immigrants who vote. Critics also said the new test could create even more backlogs in a system already plagued with delays. \u201cIt\u2019s a last-ditch effort on their way out the door for the administration to keep people from realizing their dreams of becoming citizens,\u201d said Eric Cohen, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco, a nonprofit group that helps permanent residents apply for citizenship. \u201cThere is no legal reason, no regulatory reason to do this,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, noting that the citizenship test had remained unchanged since 2008. \u201cThey decided on their own that they have to change it for political reasons.\u201d Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the naturalization process, said in a statement that the test was revised \u201cto ensure that it remains an instrument that comprehensively assesses applicants\u2019 knowledge of American history, government and values and supports assimilation.\u201d President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has the option of reversing the changes, though that likely could not occur, if at all, until several months into the new year. The new test will be required of all applicants who apply for citizenship after Dec. 1, though there is often a lag of several months between when candidates apply and when they are scheduled for an interview with a U.S.C.I.S. officer, meaning that some candidates may still be taking the old test. The current pass rate for the citizenship test, according to U.S.C.I.S., is 91 percent. An analysis of the new test by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network suggested that 40 questions out of the original 100 remained unchanged from the previous version; the rest were reworded or newly introduced. Already, some immigrants were expressing nervousness about changes to the test. Nefi Reyes, an electrician from El Salvador who took the earlier test this year, passed with a perfect score. It had been 30 years since he had crossed the border into the United States to escape the civil war in El Salvador, and he voted in the United States for the first time in November. \u201cI feel lucky that I got it done,\u201d Mr. Reyes said of the changes to the test. He had had difficulty memorizing the names of the colonies, he said, and the new test requires applicants to name not three of the original 13 states, as he had managed to do, but five. Luz Gallegos, executive director of Todec, a nonprofit group that assists immigrants in Southern California, said her organization had seen a rush in immigrants applying to take the citizenship test, not only so they could vote in the November election, but because many hoped to avoid the new test. \u201cAs it is, it\u2019s difficult for them to memorize all the answers to the civics test,\u201d she said. Immigrants are not alone in finding the citizenship test, even in its previous form, challenging. About one in three Americans could pass a multiple-choice test consisting of items taken from that version, according to a 2018 national survey by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. Most of the respondents did not know how many justices serve on the Supreme Court or which countries the United States fought in World War II. Citizenship tests have gone through various incarnations since being introduced around a century ago, replacing an earlier system, broadly criticized at the time, in which naturalization judges evaluated immigrants\u2019 knowledge of civics and the English language as they saw fit. \u201cThere was absolutely inconsistency and unfairness in the way that prospective citizens were examined by naturalization judges,\u201d said Jack Schneider, an assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, noting that such hearings resulted in the rejection of large numbers of applicants. The test has changed considerably over time. Decades ago, the test asked how tall the Bunker Hill Monument is, missing, critics said, the more important issue of what it stands for. Another question, \u201cHow many stars are there on a quarter?\u201d was deleted after it was noted that the right answer depended on the quarter. The new citizenship test is one of a number of moves made under the Trump administration to not only halt unauthorized immigration but restrict legal immigration as well. The administration has made it harder for people to obtain asylum, increased the costs of applying for citizenship and, under the cloak of the coronavirus pandemic, suspended the issuance of green cards to immigrants seeking temporary work in the country. Taken together, these moves amount to a break from what historically had been bipartisan support for naturalization for immigrants who lived and worked in the United States and embraced the opportunity to become citizens. Applicants must already fill out a 20-page application, pass background checks, submit a bevy of documents and pass civics and English tests during an interview. The government moved this year to raise fees for naturalization from $725 to $1,170, or $1,160 if the application was filed online, but a federal judge in California blocked the increase in September. Organizations that offer citizenship classes to help immigrants study for the test are scrambling to revamp their lesson plans to respond to the new questions. Lynne Weintraub, who trains citizenship instructors and was involved in the design of the 2008 test, said the revisions were adopted without outside professional input that might have helped ensure that the test was a fair and valid measure of applicants\u2019 knowledge of civics. \u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine the turmoil that this has created,\u201d Ms. Weintraub said. The new test, she said, presents additional problems for many English language learners by clustering abstract concepts into one phrase in some questions, \u201cmaking them impossible for immigrants with low English proficiency and less education to follow.\u201d",

    "article_text": "El nuevo examen para la ciudadan\u00eda estadounidense es m\u00e1s largo y complicado El gobierno de Trump est\u00e1 implementando cambios radicales en el examen que los inmigrantes deben tomar para convertirse en ciudadanos de Estados Unidos, ahora se incluyen matices de filosof\u00eda conservadora que dificultan la prueba para las personas que est\u00e1n estudiando el idioma ingl\u00e9s. La nueva prueba de ciudadan\u00eda, que entr\u00f3 en vigor el martes, es m\u00e1s larga que antes y ahora se requiere que los solicitantes respondan correctamente 12 de 20 preguntas en vez de 6 de 10. Tambi\u00e9n es m\u00e1s compleja, elimina la geograf\u00eda simple y agrega docenas de posibles preguntas posibles, algunas con frases matizadas y complicadas que podr\u00edan hacer que los solicitantes se equivoquen si no las analizan detenidamente. De las 18 preguntas que se eliminaron de la prueba anterior, 11 ten\u00edan respuestas simples, a veces de una sola palabra. El nuevo examen agrega un obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s para los inmigrantes que buscan convertirse en ciudadanos con derecho al voto, en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de una gesti\u00f3n que ha impuesto nuevas barreras para la inmigraci\u00f3n y l\u00edmites para quienes ya est\u00e1n en el pa\u00eds y aspiran a la residencia legal para, eventualmente, naturalizarse. Un tema muy comentado es que se proporciona una nueva respuesta a la pregunta: \u201c\u00bfA qui\u00e9n representa un senador de Estados Unidos?\u201d. Antes la respuesta era \u201ca toda la gente del estado\u201d; en la nueva prueba, se especifica que representa a los \u201cciudadanos\u201d en el estado. Destaca una nueva pregunta sobre la D\u00e9cima Enmienda, que reserva a los estados todos los poderes que no se le otorgan espec\u00edficamente al gobierno federal, una de las secciones favoritas de la Carta de Derechos para los conservadores que cuestionan la autoridad federal. Otra pregunta nueva, \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Estados Unidos se involucr\u00f3 en la guerra de Vietnam?\u201d, tiene una \u00fanica respuesta correcta: \u201cDetener la propagaci\u00f3n del comunismo\u201d. La prueba no aborda las intensas protestas o el enorme n\u00famero de muertos derivados de la guerra. Las organizaciones de inmigraci\u00f3n, incluidas algunas que han ayudado a miles de personas a completar sus solicitudes de naturalizaci\u00f3n durante la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, advierten que la nueva prueba podr\u00eda dificultar que los inmigrantes pobres de pa\u00edses no angloparlantes se conviertan en ciudadanos y, en \u00faltima instancia, reducir\u00eda el n\u00famero de inmigrantes que votan. Los cr\u00edticos tambi\u00e9n dijeron que el nuevo examen podr\u00eda generar m\u00e1s demoras en un sistema que ya est\u00e1 plagado de retrasos. \u201cEs el \u00faltimo esfuerzo de un gobierno que busca evitar que las personas cumplan su sue\u00f1o de convertirse en ciudadanos\u201d, dijo Eric Cohen, director ejecutivo del Centro de Recursos Legales para Inmigrantes en San Francisco, un grupo sin fines de lucro que ayuda a los residentes que solicitan la ciudadan\u00eda. \u201cNo existe una raz\u00f3n legal, ni una raz\u00f3n regulatoria para hacer esto\u201d, dijo Cohen, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la prueba de ciudadan\u00eda no hab\u00eda cambiado desde 2008. \u201cEllos decidieron por su cuenta que ten\u00edan que cambiarla por razones pol\u00edticas\u201d. Dan Hetlage, portavoz del Servicio de Ciudadan\u00eda e Inmigraci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s), la agencia que supervisa el proceso de naturalizaci\u00f3n, dijo en un comunicado que la prueba fue revisada \u201cpara garantizar que siga siendo un instrumento que eval\u00fae de manera integral el conocimiento de los solicitantes sobre la historia, el gobierno y los valores estadounidenses y apoya la asimilaci\u00f3n\u201d. El presidente electo Joseph R. Biden Jr. tiene la opci\u00f3n de revertir los cambios, aunque es probable que eso no ocurra, si es que llega a suceder, hasta que hayan transcurrido varios meses del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. La nueva prueba ser\u00e1 requerida para todas las personas que soliciten la ciudadan\u00eda despu\u00e9s del 1 de diciembre, aunque suele existir un lapso de varios meses entre el momento en que los candidatos solicitan y la fecha en que se programa la entrevista con un oficial del USCIS, lo que significa que es posible que algunos candidatos todav\u00eda presenten la prueba anterior. La tasa de aprobaci\u00f3n del actual examen de ciudadan\u00eda, seg\u00fan el USCIS, es del 91 por ciento. La Red Cat\u00f3lica de Inmigraci\u00f3n Legal hizo un an\u00e1lisis de la nueva prueba que concluy\u00f3 que 40 preguntas de las 100 originales permanecieron sin cambios con respecto a la versi\u00f3n anterior; el resto se reformul\u00f3 o se incluy\u00f3 por primera vez. Algunos inmigrantes ya han expresado su nerviosismo por los cambios en el examen. Nefi Reyes, un electricista salvadore\u00f1o que present\u00f3 la prueba anterior este a\u00f1o, aprob\u00f3 con una puntuaci\u00f3n perfecta. Hab\u00edan pasado 30 a\u00f1os desde que cruz\u00f3 la frontera hacia Estados Unidos para escapar de la guerra civil en El Salvador, y vot\u00f3 en Estados Unidos por primera vez en noviembre. \u201cMe siento afortunado de haberla presentado\u201d, dijo Reyes sobre los cambios en la prueba. Dijo que tuvo dificultades para memorizar los nombres de las colonias y el nuevo examen requiere que los solicitantes nombren cinco de los 13 estados originales, en cambio en la prueba que \u00e9l present\u00f3 solo le pidieron mencionar tres. Luz Gallegos, directora ejecutiva de Todec, un grupo sin fines de lucro dedicada a asistir a inmigrantes en el sur de California, dijo que su organizaci\u00f3n hab\u00eda visto un aluvi\u00f3n de personas que solicitaban tomar el examen de ciudadan\u00eda, no solo para poder votar en las elecciones de noviembre, sino porque muchos esperaban evitar la nueva prueba. \u201cTal como est\u00e1, es dif\u00edcil para ellos memorizar todas las respuestas de la parte de teor\u00eda c\u00edvica de la prueba\u201d, dijo. Los inmigrantes no son los \u00fanicos a quienes les parece desafiante la prueba de ciudadan\u00eda, incluso en su formulaci\u00f3n previa. Aproximadamente solo uno de cada tres estadounidenses podr\u00eda aprobar una prueba de opci\u00f3n m\u00faltiple que consta de elementos tomados de esa versi\u00f3n, seg\u00fan una encuesta nacional de 2018 realizada por la Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. La mayor\u00eda de los encuestados no sab\u00eda cu\u00e1ntos jueces forman parte de la Corte Suprema o en qu\u00e9 pa\u00edses luch\u00f3 Estados Unidos en la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las pruebas de ciudadan\u00eda han pasado por varias versiones desde que se introdujeron hace aproximadamente un siglo, remplazando un sistema anterior que fue ampliamente criticado porque los jueces de naturalizaci\u00f3n evaluaban el conocimiento de los inmigrantes sobre la educaci\u00f3n c\u00edvica y el idioma ingl\u00e9s como lo consideraban conveniente. \u201cHubo una absoluta inconsistencia e injusticia en la forma en que los jueces de naturalizaci\u00f3n examinaban a los posibles ciudadanos\u201d, dijo Jack Schneider, profesor asistente de educaci\u00f3n en la Universidad de Massachusetts, Lowell, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que esas audiencias provocaron que un gran n\u00famero de solicitantes fuesen rechazados. La prueba ha cambiado considerablemente con el paso del tiempo. Hace d\u00e9cadas, el examen preguntaba la altura del Monumento Bunker Hill, sin mencionar qu\u00e9 es lo que representa, lo cual es, seg\u00fan algunos cr\u00edticos, el aspecto m\u00e1s importante. Tambi\u00e9n preguntaban \u201c\u00bfcu\u00e1ntas estrellas hay en una moneda de 25 centavos de d\u00f3lar?\u201d, pero se elimin\u00f3 cuando fue evidente que la respuesta correcta depend\u00eda de las diferentes presentaciones de la moneda. La nueva prueba de ciudadan\u00eda forma parte de una serie de medidas que fueron tomadas durante la gesti\u00f3n de Trump, no solo para detener la inmigraci\u00f3n no autorizada, sino tambi\u00e9n para restringir la inmigraci\u00f3n legal. El gobierno ha dificultado que las personas obtengan asilo, aument\u00f3 los costos de solicitar la ciudadan\u00eda y, bajo el manto de la pandemia del coronavirus, suspendi\u00f3 la emisi\u00f3n de tarjetas de residencia a los inmigrantes que buscan trabajo temporal en el pa\u00eds. Vistas en conjunto, estas medidas equivalen a una ruptura con lo que hist\u00f3ricamente ha sido el apoyo bipartidista a la naturalizaci\u00f3n para los inmigrantes que viven y trabajan en Estados Unidos y que aprovechan la oportunidad de convertirse en ciudadanos. Las personas deben completar una solicitud de 20 p\u00e1ginas, aprobar verificaciones de antecedentes, enviar una gran cantidad de documentos y aprobar ex\u00e1menes de educaci\u00f3n c\u00edvica e ingl\u00e9s durante una entrevista. El gobierno tom\u00f3 medidas este a\u00f1o para aumentar las tarifas de naturalizaci\u00f3n de 725 a 1170 d\u00f3lares, o 1160 si la solicitud se present\u00f3 en l\u00ednea, pero un juez federal de California bloque\u00f3 el aumento en septiembre. Las organizaciones que ofrecen clases de ciudadan\u00eda para ayudar a los inmigrantes a estudiar para el examen se esfuerzan por renovar sus contenidos con el fin de responder las nuevas preguntas. Lynne Weintraub, quien capacita a instructores de ciudadan\u00eda y particip\u00f3 en el dise\u00f1o de la prueba de 2008, dijo que los cambios se adoptaron sin aportes profesionales externos que podr\u00edan haber garantizado que el examen fuera una medida justa y v\u00e1lida del conocimiento c\u00edvico de los solicitantes. \u201cNi siquiera puedes imaginar la confusi\u00f3n que esto ha creado\u201d, dijo Weintraub. La nueva prueba, dijo, presenta problemas adicionales para muchos estudiantes del idioma ingl\u00e9s al agrupar conceptos abstractos en una sola frase \u201chaciendo que sea imposible de entender para los inmigrantes con bajo nivel educativo y poco dominio del ingl\u00e9s\u201d.

    "first_p": "President Trump will face a raft of potential legal challenges when he leaves office \u2014 from, among others, the Manhattan district attorney, the New York attorney general and perhaps the United States Justice Department.",
    "article_text": "Tenants Sue Trump Over Scheme That Drove Up Their Rents President Trump will face a raft of potential legal challenges when he leaves office \u2014 from, among others, the Manhattan district attorney, the New York attorney general and perhaps the United States Justice Department. Now add to that Leonie Green of the Westminster Apartments in Brooklyn. Ms. Green is among a group of tenants in rent-regulated apartments once owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s father who have filed a lawsuit against the president and his siblings, accusing the Trumps of a decade-long fraud to win artificially high rent increases through an invoice-padding scheme. The scheme, first revealed in a 2018 investigation by The New York Times, involved tacking at least 20 percent onto the cost of materials purchased for the apartments, with Mr. Trump, his siblings and a cousin splitting the extra proceeds. The maneuver generated millions of dollars for each sibling, with no work required. While the siblings were still liable for income taxes, the maneuver allowed them to evade far-higher gift and estate taxes on part of the fortune they received from their father. But the tenants paid a price. New York laws governing rent-regulated apartments allow owners to increase rents based on the costs of major capital improvements. The Trumps based their applications for rent hikes on the artificially increased invoices, so a boiler that actually cost $50,000 would generate a rent increase as if it had cost $60,000. The new lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, seeks the extra rent paid, plus interest and triple damages, for current and former tenants in more than 30 apartment complexes that belonged to the president\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump. The mostly austere red brick buildings \u2014 with names like Beach Haven, Shore Haven and Park Briar \u2014 are spread across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The invoice-padding scheme ran from 1992 until the Trumps sold their father\u2019s buildings in 2004, but the artificially increased rents remained in place. The lawsuit could pose a significant financial threat to Mr. Trump and his family. If the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers win approval of class-action status, any potential judgment would encompass every person who paid rent in more than 14,000 rent-regulated apartments since 1992. Ms. Green, 54, said she had moved into the Westminster Apartments, in the Ditmas Park neighborhood, 22 years ago. Paying the rent on her salary as an executive assistant has been a struggle, she said, and she has fought off several eviction actions after falling behind. She was shocked to learn that her difficulties might have been made worse by a rich family \u201cstealing from me.\u201d \u201cYou try so hard, and to hear something like this, it breaks my heart, because I believe they are just taking advantage of poor people,\u201d Ms. Green said. The lawsuit was filed just before midnight on Oct. 2, moments before the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations for any fraud discovered through The Times\u2019s 2018 investigation. An amended complaint was filed on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Trump family described the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely frivolous.\u201d \u201cNot only are the allegations completely unsupported by any evidence, but they relate to events which go back nearly 30 years \u2014 yet were never once raised by anyone at any time only to be conveniently filed just one month before the 2020 presidential election,\u201d the spokeswoman, Kimberly Benza, said in a statement. Mr. Trump is already facing two New York investigations into his business activities and related tax issues \u2014 a criminal inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., and a civil one by the state attorney general, Letitia James. At least two significant civil lawsuits also remain active. The writer E. Jean Carroll claims that Mr. Trump defamed her in denying that he had raped her. And a class-action lawsuit asserts Mr. Trump\u2019s promotion of a company that promised people they could get rich selling video conference phones led them to lose money peddling an obsolete product. Mr. Trump could also face charges in matters not fully resolved during his presidency, including whether he obstructed justice in the Russia investigation or violated campaign finance laws in directing his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to make hush-money payments to two women who threatened to go public with their claims of past affairs with Mr. Trump. Jerrold S. Parker, a founding partner of Parker Waichman, a national law firm based in Port Washington, N.Y., said his firm began considering a legal remedy for the tenants after the article in The Times. The firm sought tenants this year through television and internet advertisements. The amended complaint lists 20 plaintiffs. \u201cA massive fraud spanning 28 years, victimizing several hundred thousand tenants in Trump regulated apartments, needed to be addressed,\u201d Mr. Parker said. The tenants, he said, \u201cmust be made whole as a result of the money that was unlawfully and unknowingly taken from them by the Trump family for their own personal gain.\u201d In addition to the president, the defendants in the lawsuit are his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a former federal judge, the estate of their brother Robert, who died this year, and the estate of John Walter, a favorite nephew and longtime employee of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter died in 2018. The scheme began in 1992, after the Trumps realized that the family\u2019s aging patriarch was sitting on mountains of cash that could face a 55 percent estate tax. Part of the solution came with the creation of a business they named All County Building Supply & Maintenance, which had no offices or employees and listed its address at Mr. Walter\u2019s home on Long Island. Little changed in how goods were purchased for the buildings. Fred Trump, who died in 1999, or one of his executives continued to negotiate prices, but for each purchase, Mr. Walter would generate an invoice showing that All County had bought the items, and a second invoice marked up 20 to 50 percent showing what All County had billed to Fred Trump\u2019s properties. The siblings and Mr. Walter pocketed the difference. Former prosecutors told The Times that filing padded invoices with state rent regulators could have led to criminal charges at the time, but that the statute of limitations had long since expired. Mr. Trump\u2019s federal income tax records for some of those years, which were revealed in an investigation published by The Times this September, show that he received $1.38 million from All County during the four years ending in 2003. Thanks to losses on his own endeavors, he paid federal income taxes in only one of those years, a total of $39,117 in 2003. Ms. Barry filed a financial disclosure form for 1998 showing that she collected more than $1 million that year from All County. She retired last year as a federal appellate judge, ending an inquiry into complaints, spurred by The Times\u2019s investigation, that she had violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax maneuvers, including the invoice-padding scheme. The amended complaint filed this week notes that while Fred Trump\u2019s empire was sold nearly two decades ago, the Trumps only dissolved All County shortly after the Times article was published in 2018. One vendor from the All County years, Leon Eastmond, once told The Times that he was surprised when, after selling 60 boilers to Fred Trump, he opened his mail to find a $100,000 check from All County. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company,\u201d Mr. Eastmond said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201d",

    "article_text": "No, Barr was not part of a secret plot against President Trump. Not long after Attorney General William P. Barr said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election last month, the pro-Trump media world began circulating a falsehood about him. In this telling, Mr. Barr had been part of a plot by a secret cabal of elites against President Trump all along. The most prominent right-wing personality who spread the baseless narrative was the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs. In his nightly show monologue on Tuesday, Mr. Dobbs said that Mr. Barr must be \u201ceither a liar or a fool or both\u201d and suggested that he was \u201cperhaps compromised.\u201d Mr. Dobbs added that Mr. Barr \u201cappeared to join in with the radical Dems and the deep state and the resistance.\u201d Mr. Dobbs\u2019s unfounded accusation inspired dozens of Facebook posts and more than 14,000 likes and shares on the social network, as well as hundreds of posts on Twitter, over the past 24 hours, according to a New York Times analysis. Many of President Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters reacted virulently to Mr. Barr\u2019s comments on Tuesday because they dealt a blow to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the election. The comments were also jarring to some conservatives because Mr. Barr had been a longtime Trump loyalist. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. But one of Mr. Barr\u2019s former colleagues denied the attorney general was part of a secret plot against President Trump. George Terwilliger, who was Mr. Barr\u2019s deputy in the 1990s when Mr. Barr was attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Mr. Barr\u2019s intent in his Tuesday statement was \u201cjust to be responsible.\u201d When there are unfounded conspiracy theories about the Justice Department, Mr. Terwilliger said, \u201cit is responsible to say no, that did not happen.\u201d David Rohde, a New Yorker writer and former Times reporter who wrote the book \u201cIn Deep: The F.B.I., the C.I.A., and the Truth About America\u2019s Deep State,\u201d added that Mr. Barr could not be involved with a cabal of elites because \u201cin fact, there is no deep state plot.\u201d He said the term \u201cdeep state,\u201d which is shorthand for the conspiracy theory about Democratic elites secretly exercising political control over the public, has been co-opted and vulgarized by many in the pro-Trump universe. Mr. Dobbs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The far right\u2019s suspicions of Mr. Barr have been building for several days, partly because of comments made by President Trump. In a Fox News interview on Nov. 29, the president declared that the Justice Department was \u201cmissing in action\u201d in investigating allegations of widespread election fraud. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the F.B.I. or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhere are they? I\u2019ve not seen anything.\u201d \u201cThey just keep moving along and they go on to the next president,\u201d he added. That set the stage for mistrust in Mr. Barr. Even before Mr. Barr made his comments on Tuesday about not having found voter fraud, Emerald Robinson of Newsmax, the conservative cable network, tweeted that it was \u201cobvious now that Bill Barr came out of retirement to protect the DOJ/FBI from accountability for its role in Spygate.\u201d She was referring to the convoluted and unfounded conspiracy theory involving a Democratic plot to spy on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. After Mr. Barr publicly acknowledged the election results, Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, said on Twitter and Facebook that it was \u201cmisleading\u201d and that \u201cthe DOJ has been very passive.\u201d The Gateway Pundit, the Right Scoop and The Washington Times, which are far right websites, also piled on. In various articles, the sites said: \u201cBarr\u2019s masquerade as someone opposed to the criminality of the Deep State\u201d was \u201ca venal lie,\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that the \u201cDOJ is reluctant to investigate election fraud.\u201d The articles reached up to 886,000 people on Facebook, according to the analysis by The Times.

    "article_text": "Here Are the Threats Terrorizing Election Workers WASHINGTON \u2014 In his urgent demand on Monday that President Trump condemn his angry supporters who are threatening workers and officials overseeing the 2020 vote, a Georgia elections official focused on an animated image of a hanging noose that had been sent to a young voting-machine technician. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d the official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, said at a news conference. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to explain the level of anger I have over this.\u201d But the technician in Georgia is not alone. Far from it. Across the nation, election officials and their staff have been bombarded in recent weeks with emails, telephone calls and letters brimming with menace and threats of violence, the result of their service in a presidential election in which the defeated candidate\u2019s most ardent followers have refused to accept the results. The noose may be approaching meme status among the recipients of the abuse. Amber McReynolds, the head of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes voting by mail, said she had experienced a spike in online threats since Election Day, when Mr. Trump ratcheted up false claims that fraudulent mail votes had cost him the election. One serial harasser on Twitter, she said, has been especially venomous. \u201cHe sent me a picture of a noose and said, \u2018You\u2019re a traitor to the American people,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAll because I run a nonprofit that tries to make voting by mail easier and more secure.\u201d \u201cI personally have gotten 10 or 12 of those \u2014 emails with the nooses, images of people who have been hung,\u201d said the chief election official of one Western state, who refused to be named for fear of drawing even more threats. \u201cThey don\u2019t reference anything you\u2019re doing wrong. They\u2019re just, \u2018This election was stolen. We know you had something to do with it. We\u2019re going to come for you.\u2019\u201d That official, like some others, said the threats had been sent not just to high-ranking officials whose profiles have been raised by news media interviews, but to comparatively unknown members of their staffs. They are the poisonous fallout of an election in which Mr. Trump has stoked baseless claims of election fraud on a daily basis, his lawyers have peddled conspiracy theories and supporters have called for extralegal actions with the goal of keeping Mr. Trump in power. The president\u2019s own attorney general, William P. Barr, said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have overturned the results in an election that Mr. Trump lost in the Electoral College, 306 to 232, and by almost seven million votes. Officials in some states refused to confirm threats against their election workers, worrying that acknowledging them would only make the problem worse. But published reports of election-related threats and harassment have risen steadily in recent weeks. And in interviews, a number of state and local election officials have said that the volume of intimidating communications from outsiders \u2014 some of whom even identify themselves \u2014 was unprecedented. Among the targets, according to interviews and news reports, are officials in battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, as well as election officers in less-contested states like Virginia, Vermont and Kentucky. In Philadelphia, an aide to a Republican city commissioner was bombarded with abuse shortly after the Nov. 3 vote after a Trump supporter, the former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, singled him out at a broadcast news conference. In Vermont, a caller left threatening voice mail messages on election officials\u2019 phones on Tuesday, including a call for them to face a firing squad. Although the calls were the first to be reported to law-enforcement authorities, the secretary of state, Jim Condos, said in a statement that \u201cthey are merely the extension of a pattern of vitriolic, often obscene, calls that our staff have had to endure during this election year.\u201d Arizona\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, said last month that she and her family received \u201cutterly abhorrent\u201d death threats after Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state\u2019s electoral votes. And in Phoenix, Adrian Fontes, who supervises elections across Maricopa County, said he and his staff had been threatened in \u201cplenty of instances\u201d in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right,\u201d said Mr. Fontes, a Democrat. \u201cAnd frankly, it\u2019s un-American.\u201d Not all the threats came from supporters of the president. In Michigan, The Detroit Free Press reported, the Republican chairwoman of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers was pelted with emails containing photos of dead women and threats against her daughter after she initially refused to certify the results of the election last month. But Mr. Trump and his supporters have unleashed an attack on the election results and procedures with few if any parallels in recent history. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s recently pardoned former national security adviser, on Wednesday called on the president to declare martial law and order a new election overseen by the military. Joseph DiGenova, a former United States attorney who is a lawyer for the Trump campaign, was disavowed even by the White House after he said on Monday that Christopher Krebs, the federal cybersecurity official who deemed the November election the most secure in history, should be \u201ctaken out at dawn and shot.\u201d The language reflects the increasingly out-of-bounds rhetoric by some supporters of the president. Steve Bannon, the campaign strategist who briefly served as a Trump adviser, said last month that the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, perhaps the most trusted federal scientist on coronavirus issues, should be beheaded and their heads placed on pikes outside the White House. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Krebs hours after his assurance that the election had been secure. Mr. DiGenova later told The Washington Post that his comments were \u201chyperbole in political discourse.\u201d Mr. Krebs suggested on CNN that he would take legal action against Mr. DiGenova for the statement. The Trump campaign has responded to charges that it is fomenting violence with a muted denial. A campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, in response to Mr. Sterling\u2019s remarks, said on Tuesday that the campaign denounced violence and threats \u201cif that has happened.\u201d The campaign\u2019s primary focus, he said, was on documenting voter fraud. Mr. Trump has only doubled down on his fraud claims since Mr. Sterling, a voting systems manager in the office of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, warned that \u201csomeone\u2019s going to get killed\u201d if the incendiary rhetoric surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations did not abate. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump unleashed a 46-minute video full of wild accusations of fraud and tweeted: \u201cRigged Election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia.\u201d Excepting a handful of officials like Mr. Sterling and Mr. Raffensperger, prominent Republicans have said little or nothing about the violent threats that have terrorized election officers across the country. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has declined requests for comment on Mr. Sterling\u2019s statement. David J. Becker, the director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that seeks to improve election administration, said he knew of election officials and their families in a half-dozen states who had been forced to ask for police protection and even move out of their homes because of violent threats. \u201cThese threats are frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cThese threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism. More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.\u201d \u201cThese people are public servants,\u201d he added. \u201cDisturbing is not a word that comes close to what they are experiencing right now.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Sale of Arctic Refuge Oil and Gas Leases Is Set for Early January The Trump administration said Thursday that it would sell oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska in early January, further accelerating its last-ditch effort to allow drilling there. The Bureau of Land Management said the sale would take place on Jan. 6, following the publication next Monday of a notice of sale in the Federal Register. That notice requires a 30-day comment period before a sale can occur. The announcement of a sale date came just 16 days after the bureau released a \u201ccall for nominations,\u201d which allowed oil companies and others to detail which tracts of land in the refuge were of interest for drilling. Normally, a call for nominations allows at least 30 days for such responses, followed by weeks of analysis by the bureau to ultimately decide which tracts will be offered. That time frame would have pushed a sale to just a few days before, or beyond, the Jan. 20 inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has opposed drilling in the refuge. The announcement, which came from the bureau\u2019s Alaska offices, did not mention why the timetable had been accelerated. But the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to sell drilling rights in the refuge before leaving office. Environmental groups denounced the last-minute push. \u201cThis is a shameful attempt by Donald Trump to give one last handout to the fossil fuel industry on his way out the door, at the expense of our public lands and our climate,\u201d Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. Once the sale is held, the bureau has to review and approve the leases, a process that typically takes months. But holding the sale on Jan. 6 potentially gives the bureau opportunity to finalize the leases before Inauguration Day. That would make it more difficult for the Biden administration to undo them. Environmental groups said they expected Mr. Biden to do just that. \u201cPresident Biden ran on, and was elected on, the most aggressive pro-climate platform of any successful candidate in history and he made protecting the Arctic refuge a day one priority,\u201d Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement. \u201cWe will need him to use all the tools at his disposal to stop the industrialization of this iconic national treasure.\" The plan to sell leases is also the subject of four lawsuits filed by environmental organizations, some Alaska Native groups and, in one case, a coalition of 15 states. The lawsuits contend that the Trump administration took shortcuts in the leasing process and that an environmental review was deeply flawed. The Arctic refuge is a vast expanse of virtually pristine wilderness, almost untouched by people and home to migrating caribou, polar bears and other wildlife. Of the refuge\u2019s 19 million acres, the lease sales would involve up to 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain of northeast Alaska. The environmental review, which was finalized earlier this year, recommended that almost all of the 1.5 million acres be offered for sale The refuge has long been protected by environmentalists and Congressional Democrats. But in 2017, with Republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress, the plan to sell oil and gas leases in the coastal plain was approved as part of tax legislation. President Trump has said that opening part of the refuge to oil development was among the most significant of his efforts to expand domestic fossil fuel production. The coastal plain is believed to overlie one of the last remaining significant petroleum reserves in the United States, and could potentially yield billions of barrels of oil. But that assessment is decades old and relies largely on studies that used now-outdated technology to detect petroleum deposits underground. One exploratory well was drilled in the refuge in the 1980s, and a New York Times investigation found that the results were disappointing. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has praised the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to open the refuge to drilling, saying it would provide jobs and add to Alaska\u2019s revenue, which has been suffering as oil production on the North Slope has declined over the years. More recently, oil prices have sharply declined during the pandemic. Most of the state\u2019s political leaders support drilling in the refuge as well. Yet it is not clear how much interest the sale will attract from oil companies. Drilling in the Arctic is costly, making it harder to achieve a good return on investment, especially compared with drilling in places in the Lower 48 states, like Texas, which have less onerous conditions. Moreover, purchasing the leases would be only the beginning of the process. Most experts say it would be at least a decade or longer before any oil or gas was extracted from the refuge. By then, the drive to reduce worldwide fossil fuel use may mean there is little or no market for the oil. Companies may also decide that pursuing oil in such a pristine area, one that is prized by environmentalists around the country and by some Alaska Native groups, is not worth the potential effect on their reputations. Many major banks have said they will not lend money to companies for drilling in the refuge. In the 2017 legislation, the lease sale plan was billed as a means for raising revenue for the federal treasury. The Trump administration originally estimated a $1.8 billion windfall for the government over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office later offered a lower estimate of $1.1 billion. But independent analyses, including one by The New York Times, found that even that revised amount was likely overly optimistic. Based on similar sales in Alaska over the past several decades, the analyses found potential revenue over the next decade would likely be in the range of tens of millions of dollars",

    "article_text": "Trump Hints at Another Act in Four Years, Just Like Grover Cleveland WASHINGTON \u2014 On the day that President Grover Cleveland left the White House after losing his bid for re-election, his wife, Frances, told the staff to take care of the mansion. \u201cI want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are coming back just four years from today.\u201d And they did. Nearly 128 years after the Clevelands\u2019 triumphal comeback, President Trump is signaling that he may try to become only the second president in American history to win another term after being defeated. Even as he insists that he did not lose the 2020 election, Mr. Trump has been laying plans to run again in 2024 with a kickoff as early as this month or possibly on his successor\u2019s Inauguration Day. How serious he is remains to be seen. Many allies believe his talk of another run in 2024, when he will be 78 years old, is more about maintaining his relevance, enabling him to raise funds, soothing his wounded pride and trying to shed the label of loser. But even if it is only for show, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of a 2024 race has already frozen the Republican field and could delay the emergence of a new generation of leaders while keeping the party tethered to the politically polarizing Mr. Trump for months or years to come. The outgoing president hinted at his ambitions to a crowd of Republican supporters at a White House Christmas party on Tuesday evening in his most overt semipublic comments since losing the Nov. 3 election that he refuses to concede. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing four years,\u201d he told guests in remarks posted online by a member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d If so, it would be only the latest effort by Mr. Trump to defy history and do what few if any have done before. At least a half-dozen former presidents have sought to come back in the past, but none other than Cleveland succeeded, in some cases tarnishing their reputations in the losing effort. Typically, once voters reject a sitting president, they lose interest and move on to candidates perceived to have a greater chance of success. But Mr. Trump does not appear ready to voluntarily surrender the power and attention of the White House simply to retire to Mar-a-Lago to plan his presidential library. He has already raised $170 million since Election Day, much of it for a new political organization that can be used to pay for his political activities going forward. He has talked about creating a news media platform that could take on Fox News on the right and keep him part of the national conversation. And he will retain his Twitter bullhorn with 88.7 million followers allowing him to insert himself into any debate any time he likes, a powerful tool that no other defeated president has ever had. The president\u2019s flirtation with attempting a comeback has already complicated the plans for other Republicans who would like to step up, especially those who feel they owe some loyalty to him, like Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Trump retains fervent support among many Republicans despite his loss. A poll by Politico and Morning Consult last week found that 53 percent said they would vote for him in a Republican primary in 2024, with Mr. Pence at a distant 12 percent and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, at 8 percent. Ms. Haley and others drew 4 percent or less. \u201cHe will be the prohibitive front-runner, especially if he can maintain media attention from Mar-a-Lago,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican political consultant. \u201cNobody is going to want to be the first candidate to announce they\u2019re running against him. Can you imagine the tweet storm that he\u2019ll launch against his first competitor? Any candidate that visits an early state next year will be overwhelmed with questions about their loyalty to Trump.\u201d But that could fade with time. With Mr. Trump not yet out of the Oval Office and loudly making false claims that the election was somehow stolen from him, he still commands the stage. But some Republicans argue that ultimately he cannot sustain the loyalty he now enjoys within the party given the stigma that comes with having lost the presidency and the exhaustion often expressed by many Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a politician to dominate a party for each of the four years after he\u2019s president,\u201d said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina who wrote about Cleveland and other one-term commanders in chief in \u201cThe Forgotten Presidents\u201d and testified last year before the House in favor of Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times, but it\u2019s rare.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump faces potentially serious challenges after leaving office that may make another run implausible even aside from advancing age. Among other things, he has to find a way to repay or restructure $421 million in debt and he may have legal troubles stemming from multiple investigations at the federal, state and local levels. He has privately been discussing pre-emptively pardoning members of his family before leaving office, not usually a selling point for a future political campaign. The White House declined to discuss the president\u2019s thinking about 2024, citing his efforts to contest the 2020 results, which have been certified by all of the key battleground states and are on track to being settled by the Electoral College in less than two weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any discussions of that,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked about a 2024 campaign on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the reporting, but the president\u2019s campaign is currently pursuing active litigation, and that is the focus, at least at the moment.\u201d Other presidents have sought to return to the White House without success. Martin Van Buren, who lost his bid for re-election in 1840, unsuccessfully sought his party\u2019s nomination in 1844 and then mounted a new campaign as a Free Soil candidate in 1848, but garnered only about 10 percent of the vote and won no states. Millard Fillmore, another 19th-century one-term president rejected by his own party, likewise tried the third-party route in staging a comeback campaign in 1856 as the nominee of the Know Nothings, winning 22 percent and just one state. A couple of presidents who left office voluntarily after two terms nonetheless changed their minds and sought to come back four years later without success. Ulysses S. Grant allowed his supporters to promote him for the Republican nomination in 1880, only to see the bid fizzle at the convention, while Theodore Roosevelt bolted his party and ran as head of the new Progressive or Bull Moose Party in 1912, succeeding only in taking down his handpicked Republican successor, William Howard Taft, and turning the White House over to the Democrats. Herbert Hoover, after being turned out in 1932, held out hope that the Republicans would anoint him as their nominee again in 1936 and 1940 only to be spurned. More recent defeated one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George Bush entertained no such fantasies, although Gerald R. Ford did briefly consider becoming a vice-presidential candidate four years after losing the White House. Cleveland is the only defeated president who ever moved back into the White House. A fiscally conservative Democrat, he won his first term in 1884 despite being accused of fathering a child out of wedlock, making him the nation\u2019s 22nd president. He became the only bachelor president to marry while in the White House when he wed Frances Folsom, who at 21 was 27 years younger than him. Even though he won the popular vote four years later, he lost the Electoral College to Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, over his support for lowering tariffs on foreign goods. Known for \u201can inherited strain of stubbornness that gleamed in his clear blue eyes before he was five years old,\u201d as Allan Nevins put it in his Pulitzer-winning biography, Cleveland refused to fade away and beat Harrison in 1892, fulfilling Frances\u2019s prediction and becoming the 24th president. One important difference between Cleveland and Mr. Trump is that Cleveland won the popular vote in all three presidential elections he ran in, while Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cGrover had the advantage of popular support that Trump lacks,\u201d said Matthew Algeo, the author of \u201cThe President Is a Sick Man\u201d about secret surgery Cleveland had while in office. There is little reason to think that Mr. Trump knows much about this history or even cares. Holed up in the White House, he is bruised by his election defeat, lashing out against those he blames, advancing fantasy conspiracy theories to explain it away and looking for a way to keep attention focused on himself. The prospect of running again is one way to do it, whether he goes through with it or not. And when he unhappily and involuntarily strides out of the White House for the last time in the next seven weeks, he can tell the staff to keep everything as it is now because he plans to be back.",

    "article_text": "How Is Trump\u2019s Lawyer Jenna Ellis \u2018Elite Strike Force\u2019 Material? Jenna Ellis broke into the legal profession in 2012 as a deputy district attorney in Weld County, Colo., a largely rural area that would soon make headlines for a failed attempt to secede from the rest of the state because some residents resented the growing dominance of more liberal communities to the south like Denver. Ms. Ellis prosecuted crimes like theft and assault, felonies of a different magnitude from the claims of sweeping fraud and criminal conspiracy she makes today as a top lawyer to President Trump. It wasn\u2019t long before she parlayed her law degree and experience as a prosecutor into jobs that thrust her beyond her corner of the state: She took a position with James Dobson, the evangelical heavyweight, joined the faculty at Colorado Christian University and started appearing on Denver radio as a legal commentator. By late 2018, regular viewers of cable news would come to know Ms. Ellis as a \u201cconstitutional law attorney\u201d \u2014 her preferred title \u2014 who aggressively came to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense as he faced investigation and impeachment. But a review of her professional history, as well as interviews with more than a half-dozen lawyers who have worked with her, show that Ms. Ellis, 36, is not the seasoned constitutional law expert she plays on TV. In many ways, that makes her ideal for the role she has now fashioned for herself: She is a star player in the president\u2019s theater of grievance and denial whose lack of relevant experience with the legal questions at hand has had no apparent bearing on her ability to present herself as someone of great authority. Since she graduated law school in 2011, nothing in her record in the courtroom \u2014 limited mostly to appearances in state court as a prosecutor or as counsel for clients charged with assault, prostitution, theft and domestic abuse \u2014 shows any time spent litigating election law cases. She holds herself out as an expert on the Constitution based on her self-published book and her teaching of pre-law classes to undergraduates. She has never appeared in federal district or circuit court, where most constitutional matters are considered, according to national databases of federal cases, and does not appear to have played a major role in any cases beyond her criminal and civil work in Colorado. On paper, the Trump campaign calls her a senior legal adviser. She has recently appeared alongside Rudolph W. Giuliani and other Trump lawyers \u2014 a group Ms. Ellis described as an \u201celite strike force team\u201d \u2014 at public hearings where she amplified the president\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud. Ms. Ellis\u2019s work appears to largely be in a public relations capacity. The Trump campaign and its supporters have so far filed about 50 election-related lawsuits. She has not signed her name or appeared in court to argue a single one. In a written statement responding to questions about her record, Ms. Ellis described herself as \u201ca highly experienced and highly qualified attorney and expert in my field.\u201d Any assertions to the contrary \u201ccast me in a false light,\u201d she said. The Trump campaign provided the name of one federal case in which it said Ms. Ellis had participated, in 2012, when she was a year out of law school. But her name is not among the lawyers listed in the decision, and the case was not heard in a regular federal court, but rather in an administrative tribunal. It has been a month since Election Day. In the weeks since, as Mr. Trump has refused to bow to the reality of his defeat, his fruitless attempts to persuade federal judges and state officials to undo the results have introduced the nation to a once-obscure cast of lawyers, legislators and local elections commissioners. Ms. Ellis is a natural in her newly prominent role. She has been front and center at several public sessions with Mr. Giuliani over the past week. Convened by pro-Trump Republican lawmakers, they serve no legal purpose and are essentially scaled-down political rallies for the president to vent his frustrations. At one last week in Pennsylvania and another on Monday in Arizona, the president called Ms. Ellis\u2019s cellphone and she held it near a microphone so the crowd could hear him speak. \u201cI find it astonishing that she\u2019s gotten to this point,\u201d said Stephanie Stout, a lawyer in private practice in Greeley, Colo., who worked with Ms. Ellis a few years ago defending a man who was accused of attempted murder. The partnership was short-lived, Ms. Stout said, because their client fired Ms. Ellis, deeming her not up to the job. \u201cShe just didn\u2019t have the legal chops,\u201d added Ms. Stout, who ultimately won the case on her own. \u201cAfter that, Jenna decided that I had stolen the case from her.\u201d The president\u2019s legal efforts to overturn the election have slowly petered out. Mr. Trump and his Republican supporters have already lost or withdrawn from nearly 40 lawsuits, leaving only a handful of cases still alive in courts across the country \u2014 and, of course, the very unlikely scenario that the Supreme Court will step in to save him. Lawyers who worked with Ms. Ellis said that she was not the kind of attorney they believed would be particularly helpful to this or any president in these endeavors, given her background. Craig Silverman, a lawyer in Denver who used to host a radio show on legal matters and current events that Ms. Ellis occasionally appeared on, described her as \u201can attorney of scant accomplishment.\u201d The cases she discussed with him, he recalled, were bread-and-butter criminal defense work. And he said he had always expected her to pursue a career in teaching and media \u2014 not the law. Then Mr. Silverman read the news last year that Mr. Trump had made her a senior legal adviser to his campaign. \u201cWhen I saw \u2018senior legal adviser,\u2019 it was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a title like that,\u201d he added, \u201cnobody knew her to be that type of lawyer.\u201d Though Mr. Silverman once considered himself friendly with Ms. Ellis, he said her insistence of widespread voter fraud had so unnerved him that he believed she might have violated Colorado\u2019s rules of professional conduct for lawyers, which prohibit making false statements. Ms. Ellis went to work for at least three private law firms in Northern Colorado after leaving the district attorney\u2019s office in 2013. Her professional biographies at the time cited her experience in landlord-tenant disputes and cases involving immigrants who accepted plea deals without being advised of the consequences. Some colleagues came away impressed. \u201cNo matter what anyone thinks of her, my experience was that she was a brilliant lawyer,\u201d said the founder of one of the firms, Brandon Marinoff. Mr. Marinoff said Ms. Ellis was with his firm for less than a year before moving on to a higher-paying job. In 2015 she joined Colorado Christian University as an affiliate faculty member and published her book, \u201cThe Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution: A Guide for Christians to Understand America\u2019s Constitutional Crisis,\u201d in which she lamented how the country had lost its way.  In other writings, she has reserved a particular disdain for the gay and transgender communities. In 2016, for instance, she referred to gay people on Facebook as \u201csinners\u201d whose \u201cconduct is vile and abominable.\u201d Colorado Christian does not have a law school or a program in constitutional law. Ms. Ellis taught pre-law and political science to undergraduates and was part of the team that developed and advised a moot court program, according to a university spokesman. Eventually she was made an assistant professor of legal studies \u2014 but never a \u201cprofessor of constitutional law,\u201d which is how she identified herself in pieces for The Washington Examiner that she started writing in 2017. She left teaching in 2018 to become the director of the Dobson Policy Institute, a small outfit in the evangelical empire of Mr. Dobson, who founded the socially conservative, Colorado Springs-based group Focus on the Family.  Her affiliations with The Examiner and the Dobson name helped her branch out from local radio to Fox News, where she appears to have first caught the eye of the president. A graduate of the University of Richmond law school, Ms. Ellis did not have the Ivy League, white-shoe credentials that typically impress Mr. Trump. But she did have an attribute that can carry just as much weight in his eyes: the ability to go on television and deliver scathing attacks on his critics. Ms. Ellis beat the drum for the president on cable and wherever else she had a platform. She issued statements from the Dobson Policy Institute praising the administration\u2019s \u201cdedication to the rule of law\u201d as Mr. Trump fanned fears about a migrant caravan moving through Mexico.  Mr. Trump liked what he saw. In August 2018, he posted to his Twitter account a claim Ms. Ellis had made on Fox News about bias in the F.B.I. He formally brought her on board as a campaign adviser in November 2019. As part of a presidential campaign with such a diffuse power structure, Ms. Ellis did not have much responsibility beyond her media appearances. But aides said that she did reinforce some of Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts, such as when she urged him to use the National Guard more aggressively against demonstrators over the summer. She has also gone to battle for him on Twitter. She was widely condemned after she reacted to the news that Senator Kamala Harris of California would become Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s running mate by saying that Ms. Harris\u2019s voice \u201csounds like Marge Simpson.\u201d She even drew a response from the creators of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who made a short video in which Marge scolds Ms. Ellis, saying, \u201cI teach my children not to name call, Jenna.\u201d But those who know Ms. Ellis said they imagined that her willingness to say almost anything in the president\u2019s defense was what he found appealing about her. Mr. Silverman, the Denver lawyer who knew her from his radio show, said that as a former prosecutor himself, he found what Ms. Ellis had done with her law career outrageous, but that he could see her utility to a president who does not let facts get in his way.  \u201cShe will go all in,\u201d Mr. Silverman said, \u201cas she\u2019s proved.\u201d Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.",

Stephen Colbert Invites You to Guess Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night\u2019s highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We\u2019re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. President Trump is reported to have discussed the possibility of granting pre-emptive pardons to three of his children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. On \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert made a \u201cfun criminal activity page\u201d out of it, inviting viewers to match the person in Trump\u2019s circle to his or her alleged malfeasance.  \u201cOn the left, you see all of the potential pardon-getters, and on the right, there\u2019s a list of crimes, like money laundering, tax evasion and snorting coke off the last living black rhino. You have to match the person to their crime, and there are no wrong answers.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not just Rudy and the kids. Several of the president\u2019s allies have begun a campaign to petition the West Wing in hopes of securing pardons. One White House source says, \u2018You won\u2019t believe the amount of calls, some insane, we\u2019ve gotten.\u2019 Oh, I believe you\u2019re getting a lot of calls. What I don\u2019t believe is that only some of them are insane.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cBut it does lead to one obvious question: What are they guilty of? For some of them, it\u2019s pretty easy. Jared Kushner has long been suspected of shady financial dealings. Plus he\u2019s obviously Slender Man.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cI don\u2019t believe Eric has violated any laws, but he\u2019s still grateful to get a pardon. [imitating Eric] \u2018This is the best Christmas gift that my dad has ever given me. Also, the only Christmas gift.\u2019\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cAw, guys, that is adorable. Trump is pardoning his kids and his house pets.\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cAnd he\u2019s not even pardoning them for anything specific. Trump is just handing out pardons like they\u2019re gift cards: [as Trump] \u2018I figured I\u2019d let you pick your own crime, so enjoy. Do something crazy, you know? Live a little.\u2019\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cOf course the big question now is, can Trump legally pardon himself? Because you see, no one knows for sure. But I actually want Trump to try it, just because it will be fun to see how he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll probably be in the mirror like, [as Trump] \u2018I hereby pardon you. No, I pardon, stop pointing at me. I\u2019m trying to pardon you. You\u2019re pardoned. You\u2019re so good-looking, but you\u2019re pardoned.\u2019\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cIt\u2019s not a great look for your presidency when your biggest accomplishment is \u2018most family members pardoned.\u2019\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, the last person who needed pardons for their whole family was Charles Manson.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cAccording to legal experts, Trump\u2019s children may need pardons due to potential conflicts of interest arising between their business dealings and conversations with their father. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner needs a pardon for the time he killed a drifter just so he could feel something.\u201d \u2014 JAMES CORDEN \u201cUsually presidents grant pardons after they\u2019ve been vetted very carefully by the Justice Department. Trump is shooting them out of a T-shirt cannon right now.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY KIMMEL \u201cSome families get each other sweaters for Christmas, the Trumps get pardons.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cPre-emptive pardons for his family \u2014 although to be fair, Don Jr. says he doesn\u2019t need a pardon unless cocaine is illegal.\u201d \u2014 JAMES CORDEN \u201cYep, Trump said he wants to focus on taking care of his loved ones, those closest to him, and Eric.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cMeanwhile, Mike Pence is also asking for a pardon, for the time he accidentally glanced at a picture of Kate Upton.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON Jamie Dornan played a game of \u201cLike, Follow, Block\u201d with Jimmy Fallon.

    "article_text": "U.S. Tightens Visa Rules for Chinese Communist Party Members The Trump administration on Wednesday issued new rules to curtail travel to the United States by members of the Chinese Communist Party and their immediate families, a move certain to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries. The new policy, which took immediate effect, limits the maximum duration of travel visas for party members and their families to one month, according to a State Department spokesman.  That means the Chinese recipient must use the visa to enter the United States within one month of it being issued. Based on standard procedure, U.S. border officials would determine at the point of entry how long the visitor can stay. The officials could still permit a multi-month visit.  A visa also does not guarantee entry into the United States; it only allows for consideration of entry by U.S. border officials. Previously, party members, like other Chinese citizens, could obtain visitor visas for the United States that were valid for up to 10 years. Travel visas for party members will also be limited to a single entry rather than multiple entries as was possible before, according to two people familiar with the changes. The new measures do not affect party members\u2019 eligibility for other kinds of visas, such as immigration or employment. The State Department spokesman added that no current visas would be revoked as a result of the policy changes. The spokesman made his comments after The New York Times reported on the new limits. The new visa rules add to the conflict, now years long, between the two countries on trade, technology and much else. Coming in the twilight of the Trump administration and aimed squarely at China\u2019s ruling elite, the visa restrictions and the likely Chinese response will be yet another challenge to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is inheriting a U.S.-China relationship that is in its worst state since the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1979. While some might hope for a reset of relations from Mr. Biden, his views on China have hardened since he was vice president under President Barack Obama. Mr. Biden appears to be committed to leaving in place many of the tough measures taken by the Trump administration, including tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.  In a Tuesday interview, Mr. Biden said he would first consult with allies to craft a more comprehensive response to Chinese trade tactics. He has also said he would forcefully address China\u2019s human rights violations, including mass detentions in the western region of Xinjiang. Chinese officials have worried that Mr. Biden will be more effective than President Trump at leading a broad global pushback against China. In principle, the new visa policy could affect the travel of roughly 270 million people, according to U.S. government estimates based on a Communist Party membership of 92 million. In practice, it might be difficult to determine who, apart from high-level officials, belongs to the party. That could grant Mr. Biden flexibility in enforcing the new rules, though it would be hard to ignore travel to the United States by top Chinese officials and their family members. According to the people familiar with the new rules for travel visas, American officials can make a determination about someone\u2019s Communist Party status based on their visa application and interview, as well as officials\u2019 local understanding of party membership. That could mean that the policy disproportionately hits China\u2019s top government and business leaders rather than the millions of lower-level members who join the party to get a leg up in areas as varied as business and the arts. China\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, has reasserted the primacy of the party in many aspects of daily life.  The State Department spokesman called the move part of \u201congoing policy, regulatory, and law-enforcement action across the U.S. government to protect our nation from the C.C.P.\u2019s malign influence.\u201d \u201cFor decades we allowed the C.C.P. free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,\u201d he added. The policy change is likely to prompt retaliation from Beijing, though travel between China and the United States has already been hugely limited by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2018, almost three million Chinese citizens traveled to the United States. A spokeswoman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, condemned the new rules during a news conference on Thursday. \u201cWe hope people in the United States will adopt a common rational view toward China and give up their hatred and abnormal mind-set toward the Communist Party,\u201d Ms. Hua said, according to Bloomberg News. The new rules could prove to be a first step in attempting to systematically track lower-level party members who visit the United States. People who attempt to conceal their party membership while applying for a visa could be exposing themselves to charges of visa fraud if later discovered.  Even so, the restrictions are more moderate than an outright ban on travel to the United States by party members, which Trump administration officials had discussed this summer. The Trump administration has sought to push back against what it says are interference operations by the party in the United States. This year the Justice Department charged eight people with carrying out a harassment campaign on Beijing\u2019s behalf aimed at Chinese political dissidents and fugitives. It also charged Chinese researchers studying in the United States with visa fraud, saying they misled the American government about their status as officers in China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army. Under Mr. Trump, the State Department has announced other visa restrictions on various categories of Chinese citizens. These include officials responsible for the mass internment and surveillance of Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region, people working in the United States for state-controlled Chinese news organizations and officials deemed to be responsible for the political crackdown in Hong Kong. In May, American officials said the government was canceling the visas of graduate- or higher-level students in the United States who had ties to certain Chinese military institutions. Chinese students make up the largest group of international students in the country. The United States and China agreed in 2014 to increase the longest duration of tourist and business visas issued to each other\u2019s citizens to 10 years from one year. The arrangement was reached during a visit to Beijing by Mr. Obama, in an era of warmer relations between the two nations. In announcing the new visa policy at the time, the White House touted the benefits to the American tourism industry and to trade and other commercial ties with China.

    "article_text": "Congress Will Press Ahead on Military Bill, Defying Trump\u2019s Veto Threat WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress said on Wednesday that they would press ahead in advancing an annual military policy bill without adding a repeal demanded by President Trump of a legal shield for social media companies, defying his threat to veto the legislation over the unrelated issue. Republicans\u2019 determination to advance the measure over Mr. Trump\u2019s objections amounted to a rare refusal by his allies on Capitol Hill to accommodate the president\u2019s hard-line stance, which has threatened to imperil the bill that authorizes pay raises for American troops. And it raised the prospect of a possible veto showdown in the final weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 on a popular measure that has not failed to pass in 60 years. \u201cI don\u2019t want it on this bill, because we can\u2019t have a bill if that language is on it,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, describing what he told the president about the legal liability provision. \u201cWe just had an honest disagreement, very friendly.\u201d Mr. Trump threatened in July to veto the legislation over a provision requiring the removal of Confederate leaders\u2019 names from military bases, a measure that drew broad bipartisan support and was included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill. But with his time in office winding down, the president has become increasingly fixated on the idea of using the popular, must-pass legislation to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which protects platforms like Facebook and YouTube from being sued over much of the content posted by their users, and how they choose to take that content down. The provision has attracted increasing criticism from both parties, but especially from Mr. Trump and his allies, who say tech companies have hid behind it while suppressing conservative views. The White House had quietly floated the idea that Mr. Trump might drop his objection to renaming military bases if lawmakers would go along on Section 230. The notion met with swift opposition from members of both parties. On Tuesday night, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to warn that he would veto the bill if it did not include the repeal. Lawmakers and aides had worked for days to resolve the dispute, with Democrats refusing to accept any change to Section 230 and Republicans quietly discussing potential compromises even as many privately conceded such a provision did not belong on the defense measure. By late Tuesday night, Republicans had reached a breaking point, concluding that they had no choice but to move the bill forward without it. It is not yet clear whether Mr. Trump will make good on his threat to veto the bill, and less clear still whether lawmakers could muster the two-thirds supermajority in both chambers to achieve what would be the first veto override of his presidency. But in an interview on Wednesday, Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, hinted that such an outcome was possible. \u201cLane No. 1, at this point, is the president comes to his senses,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cLane No. 2 is we get as strong a vote as possible and we override.\u201d \u201cI think we get a two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate and we get it done,\u201d he added. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the president \u201cis serious\u201d about the veto. \u201cThe president will always defend our military, ensure that we get adequate defense funding, as he\u2019s gotten $2.9 trillion so far,\u201d Ms. McEnany said, \u201cbut he is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d At least one Republican, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who sits on the Armed Services Committee and opposed the base-renaming amendment, deriding it as \u201cwoke fundamentalism,\u201d said he would vote against the final bill. Using the abbreviation for the bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, Mr. Hawley wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe NDAA does NOT contain any reform to Section 230 but DOES contain Elizabeth Warren\u2019s social engineering amendment to unilaterally rename bases & war memorials w/ no public input or process.\u201d But Mr. Smith said that after initially digging in over the base-renaming language amid a national outcry for racial justice, Mr. Trump appeared to have lost interest in the issue. \u201cHe got distracted, and the basic strength of the other side of the argument won the day,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that the president and the people around him realized this was not a fight that they wanted to have.\u201d On no other issue have Republicans been as willing to challenge Mr. Trump as on national security, expressing rare public disapproval over his attempts to end interminable conflicts overseas and his cozy relationship with dictators in violation of human rights abuses. In defying Mr. Trump on the military policy measure, Republican leaders also may have their eyes on a pair of runoffs in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate. The state is home to a dozen military installations populated by personnel who would be denied a pay raise and improvements to military housing if the military bill were derailed. The protections provided by Section 230 have allowed Silicon Valley\u2019s giants to grow rapidly. But the companies\u2019 critics say the law gave them a free pass from policing content like explicit images of children and videos produced by terrorist groups. That criticism is bipartisan: President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has called for the protections to be \u201crevoked.\u201d Over the course of negotiations, Republicans in the Senate suggested a wide range of changes to Section 230, none of which interested House Democrats, said multiple people familiar with the matter. One proposal was to attach language, championed by Republican lawmakers who believe social media platforms are slanted against conservatives, that would narrow the liability shield. They also floated language drafted by the Justice Department to limit the protections. Republicans also proposed adding more moderate language from a bipartisan bill that would require platforms to quickly take down content in response to court orders, said two people familiar with the matter. Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is an author of that proposal, said in a Tuesday night tweet that the idea that Section 230 should be \u201crepealed, with no hearing, in the defense bill, is goofy.\u201d Many in the president\u2019s own party privately agreed with Mr. Schatz\u2019s assessment. When senior Republican lawmakers were first told of Mr. Trump\u2019s demand, some initially responded by laughing out loud, according to officials familiar with the discussions.

    "article_text": "A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts video filled with falsehoods. Increasingly isolated in the White House, President Trump on Wednesday released a 46-minute videotaped speech filled with lies in which he spoke angrily about a \u201crigged\u201d election even though his own attorney general and election officials across the country have attested to his loss. Mr. Trump posted a short, two-minute version of the speech on Twitter, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House and delivered behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal, with a link to the full version on his Facebook page. Saying that his remarks \u201cmay be the most important speech I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d the president once again refused to concede defeat in his bid for re-election almost one month after Election Day. Instead, he repeated a long series of false assertions about voter fraud, accusing Democrats of a conspiracy to steal the presidency. Twitter quickly labeled the post as \u201cdisputed.\u201d Facebook added a note that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who received almost 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes, is the projected winner of the election. The video, which a White House official said was recorded last week, was the in-person embodiment of Mr. Trump\u2019s staccato tweets during the past three weeks: one falsehood after another about voting irregularities in swing states, Democratic conspiracies, attacks on state officials and signature verifications. The president\u2019s rambling assertions in the video were drastically undercut on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr told The Associated Press that despite inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Mr. Trump continued to rage about voting irregularities in the video, a day after a Republican elections official in Georgia lashed out at him, saying the president was inspiring violence and was to blame for a wave of death threats. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager in Georgia. \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d At the end of the video, Mr. Trump improbably described himself as the defender of America\u2019s election system, saying he had been told that the single most important accomplishment of his presidency would be protecting the integrity of the voting system. It was unclear why Mr. Trump waited until Wednesday to release the video. But he made it public after a series of rebukes by members of his own party who have increasingly abandoned him as he clings to power by making baseless assertions about voter fraud that have been roundly rejected. The president\u2019s legal team, led by his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, has lost dozens of lawsuits in courts across the country while making wild allegations without any proof to back them up. Some of the president\u2019s key Republican allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have urged him to move on in recent days. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred this week to the \u201cnew administration\u201d that would be taking over next year, a clear signal to Mr. Trump that his time in office was coming to an end. Lawmakers in both parties have also signaled that they may be willing to defy his threat to veto the military spending bill unless Congress eliminates a legal provision that provides liability protection for social media companies. Those social media platforms remain the president\u2019s favorite method for disseminating false and misleading information. Within a few hours, his tweet had been \u201cliked\u201d by almost 134,000 Twitter users, and his Facebook video had been shared 93,000 times.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fund-Raiser for Maya Wiley? Yes, but It\u2019s Mary Trump Mary L. Trump has had a busy year: writing a best-selling memoir about her family, suing for her inheritance and trying to prevent her uncle from winning a second term as president. Now she has turned her attention to the New York City mayor\u2019s race. Ms. Trump will host an online fund-raiser on Tuesday for Maya Wiley, the former MSNBC analyst and counsel for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Wiley is one of at least 10 Democratic candidates running for mayor next year, creating a mad scramble to raise money before the June 22 primary. The friendship between Ms. Wiley and Ms. Trump, both liberal favorites with hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, goes back to at least August, when Ms. Trump expressed support for Ms. Wiley in a tweet: \u201cI truly hope you are NYC\u2019s next mayor,\u201d she wrote. In late October, Ms. Trump held an online event to highlight President Trump\u2019s failures and invited Ms. Wiley, along with other guests like Patti LuPone, the Broadway star. Ms. Trump and Ms. Wiley both supported President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ms. Trump said in an interview that she had seen Ms. Wiley on MSNBC and was impressed. After her event, Ms. Trump asked how she could help with her mayoral bid. \u201cI think what I said was, \u2018I\u2019ll do whatever you need me to do,\u2019\u201d Ms. Trump said. Ms. Trump, a clinical psychologist who announced her second book on \u201cAmerica\u2019s national trauma\u201d this week, said she was drawn to the historic nature of Ms. Wiley\u2019s candidacy as a Black woman \u2014 New York has never had a female mayor \u2014 and her message of not just rebuilding the city after the pandemic, but reimagining it. \u201cAt the heart of that is grappling with inequality and racial inequality,\u201d Ms. Trump said. \u201cBecause of the way she talks about the issues and her grasp of them, I think she\u2019s the person to do the best job.\u201d While New Yorkers flocked to the polls in November to vote against Mr. Trump, it is unclear how much, if at all, his presidency remains an issue in the mayor\u2019s race. Ester Fuchs, a politics professor at Columbia University, said that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be a major factor in the primary because all of the Democratic candidates strongly opposed him, but that he could increase voter participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still so traumatic for New Yorkers,\u201d she said of the Trump presidency, \u201cthat it will help with civic engagement and turnout in the mayoral race.\u201d As the city faces a troubling second wave of the coronavirus, nearly all of the candidates have moved to online fund-raisers. While the prospect of another video call might seem like a chore, a celebrity host can create a little excitement. Ms. Wiley has scheduled online events with other prominent hosts, including Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon; Tom Colicchio, the celebrity chef; and V, the writer formerly known as Eve Ensler. But at least one candidate, Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, is holding in-person fund-raisers. Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, was captured dining with donors at an Upper West Side restaurant by The Daily News. Democratic leaders in Brooklyn also faced a backlash after they were photographed mingling without face masks at a recent birthday party that Mr. Adams briefly attended. His mayoral campaign said it had strict protocols to make sure his events were safe. \u201cEric believes that all campaigns should follow the law and public health standards to prevent the spread of Covid-19 \u2014 and that is what the campaign has done,\u201d his spokesman, Evan Thies, said. \u201cIf the state decides it is no longer safe for New Yorkers to frequent small businesses, the campaign will, of course, follow that rule as well.\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his second term, stopped short of saying in-person fund-raisers should be banned, but he urged candidates to exhibit caution. \u201cThey have to be really, really careful and show people that they\u2019re following the rules,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. Ms. Wiley is holding a flood of online fund-raisers hosted by a range of Black scholars and liberal donors, including Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a prominent professor at Columbia Law School; Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, a group of major liberal donors; Zachary Carter, the former corporation counsel for Mayor de Blasio; and Coraminita Mahr, a vice president of the powerful 1199 SEIU union. Ms. Wiley\u2019s greatest liability to voters may be the time she spent working for Mr. de Blasio, whose popularity has steadily diminished since he was first elected in 2013. She has sought to distance herself from him. Ms. Trump, who lives on Long Island but grew up in New York City, understood Ms. Wiley\u2019s predicament. Asked about the mayor\u2019s weaknesses, she joked: \u201cHow much time do you have?\u201d and then scoffed at his failed presidential bid. Ms. Trump said Mr. de Blasio seemed like someone who did not know how to grapple with issues on the ground. \u201cI think Maya is a really grounded person who understands that we can\u2019t just spout platitudes,\u201d Ms. Trump said. \u201cWe have to do the work. That reason alone would make her a better mayor than de Blasio.\u201d The race has been reshaped by the pandemic as candidates try to prove who is best qualified to lead the city out of economic crisis. One such candidate is Raymond McGuire, a vice chairman at Citigroup, who quickly raised more than $2 million after entering the race in October. Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, has cast himself as the most proven fiscal leader among the candidates, saying that he would \u201cmanage the hell out of this city.\u201d He has also focused on securing endorsements from progressive leaders, including Jimmy Van Bramer, the City Council member who helped defeat the deal for an Amazon headquarters in Queens. Mr. Stringer has a few celebrity backers of his own, including a $2,000 donation in June from Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gaga\u2019s mother, and an online fund-raiser this week by Danny Strong, a Hollywood producer, with tickets ranging from $25 to $250. Mr. Stringer, whose mother died from the virus in April, is holding only online fund-raisers. \u201cThe last time Comptroller Stringer held an indoor fund-raiser was in early March, before the quarantine period began, and will not do so again until it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Cameron Hellerman, a spokesman for his campaign. Mr. Adams announced two of his own endorsements on Tuesday: Roxanne J. Persaud, a state senator, and Jaime R. Williams, a state assemblywoman, both women of color from Brooklyn. When Mr. Adams\u2019s deputy was photographed at an indoor birthday party last month without a mask, Mr. Adams said publicly that he accepted her apology. But he failed to mention that he also attended the party. \u201cEric arrived at the party late, saw there was about 10 or 12 people there, said a quick happy birthday and left,\u201d his spokesman said.",

    "article_text": "Can Trump Pre-emptively Pardon Allies or Himself? Clemency Power, Explained WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump enters the endgame of his time in power, he is said to have consulted advisers about the possibility of granting pre-emptive pardons to his relatives and to allies like his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Trump has also claimed that he has \u201cthe absolute right to pardon myself,\u201d raising the possibility that he may try to impose roadblocks against any future federal prosecution of himself. And a federal judge this week unsealed heavily redacted documents revealing that the F.B.I. has been investigating an unidentified person for a potential pardon-for-bribe scheme. The rising chatter about pardon issues follows closely on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s pardon last week of his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and has heightened interest in the scope and limits of his clemency power. Here is what you need to know. It is an executive power that acts as a check and balance on the federal criminal justice system, enabling a president to bestow mercy upon offenders. The Constitution gives the president clemency powers \u201cto grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\u201d This could be either a commutation, which reduces or eliminates a sentence imposed after a conviction for a crime, or a pardon \u2014 a broader nullification of all legal consequences for an offense. Yes. In Ex parte Garland, an 1866 case involving a former Confederate senator who had been pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, the Supreme Court said the pardon power \u201cextends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.\u201d It is unusual for a president to issue a prospective pardon before any charges are filed, but there are examples, perhaps most famously President Gerald R. Ford\u2019s pardon in 1974 of Richard M. Nixon to prevent him from being prosecuted after the Watergate scandal. And in 1977, on his first day in office, President Jimmy Carter pardoned hundreds of thousands of men who had dodged the draft during the Vietnam War, enabling many who had fled to Canada to return home without fear of prosecution. No. For one thing, Mr. Trump only has clemency power over federal offenses. Some types of offense \u2014 like tax evasion and financial fraud \u2014 are offenses under both federal and state law. Mr. Trump does not have the authority to prevent state prosecutors from pursuing charges over such a matter. State prosecutors in New York are investigating various matters related to Mr. Trump\u2019s financial dealings. Moreover, a pardon could increase one type of risk: When a pardon eliminates the possibility that the recipient might be prosecuted for a purely federal crime, it also eliminates the ability of that person to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying about it. Thus, pardon recipients subpoenaed before Congress or a grand jury would be compelled to talk; if they lied or refused to testify, that would be a new crime. Yes. The Constitution does not bar pardons that raise the appearance of self-interest or a conflict of interest, even if they may provoke a political backlash and public shaming. Shortly before leaving office in 1993, President George Bush pardoned six Reagan administration officials over \u201ctheir conduct related to the Iran-contra affair,\u201d including Caspar W. Weinberger, the former defense secretary who was about to go to trial on charges that he had lied to Congress. The independent prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, had been planning in the trial to explore whether Bush had played a greater role than he had acknowledged when he was the vice president, and Mr. Walsh accused Bush of a \u201ccover-up.\u201d In 2001, shortly before leaving office, President Bill Clinton issued several controversial pardons, including to his half brother, Roger Clinton, over a 1985 cocaine conviction for which he had served about a year in prison, and to Susan H. McDougal, a onetime Clinton business partner who had been jailed as part of the Whitewater investigation. This is unclear. Usually, pardons are written in a way that specifically describes which crimes or sets of activities they apply to. There is little precedent laying out the degree to which a pardon can be used to instead foreclose criminal liability for anything and everything. Notably, Ford\u2019s \u201cfull, free and absolute pardon\u201d of Nixon was extraordinarily broad. It covered all federal crimes Nixon \u201ccommitted or may have committed\u201d during his presidency, rather than listing particular matters or categories of activities. But because prosecutors did not try to charge Nixon, the validity of this rare, open-ended clemency was untested. In a law journal article this year, Aaron Rappaport, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings, argued that pardons must be specific about what they are covering. He cited English common-law principles that informed the founders\u2019 understanding of pardons, as well as fundamental democratic values. Still, he also acknowledged that \u201cthe existence of a specificity requirement has never been acknowledged by the Supreme Court.\u201d This is unclear. There is no definitive answer because no president has ever tried to pardon himself and then faced prosecution anyway. As a result, there has never been a case that gave the Supreme Court a chance to resolve the question. In the absence of any controlling precedent, legal thinkers are divided about the matter. Those who believe a president can pardon himself point out that the relevant text in the Constitution is broadly written and contains no explicit exception precluding a self-dealing use or abuse of that power. Because the founders did make an explicit exception for cases of impeachment, they argued, that implies they did not intend there to be any other exceptions. But other legal thinkers have come up with theories for why the Supreme Court might nevertheless reject a purported self-pardon if it ever came up. For example, some scholars have argued that the founders\u2019 use of the word \u201cgrant\u201d should be interpreted as meaning one person giving something to another, so a president cannot grant a pardon to himself. In August 1974, four days before Nixon resigned, Mary C. Lawton, then the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, issued a terse legal opinion stating that \u201cit would seem\u201d that he could not pardon himself \u201cunder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d But she did not explain what transformed that principle into an unwritten legal limit on the power the Constitution bestows on presidents. Yes. He could get Vice President Mike Pence to do it for him, using the 25th Amendment. This part of the Constitution provides a mechanism for temporarily making the vice president the \u201cacting president\u201d when a president is disabled from carrying out his duties. In 2002 and 2007, for example, when President George W. Bush was preparing to be sedated for colonoscopies, he briefly handed the powers of the presidency to Vice President Dick Cheney. In her 1974 memo, Ms. Lawton argued that it would be lawful for a president to declare himself temporarily disabled, receive a pardon from the vice president and then resume his role as president. Probably. The Constitution does not create any explicit exception that invalidates pardons that were granted under dubious circumstances \u2014 like if a president took money in exchange, or was buying the silence of a witness to his own wrongdoing. Grants of clemency are widely understood to be irrevocable. Still, a president who grants a pardon under corrupt circumstances could open himself up to prosecution for acts like bribery or obstruction of justice after he leaves office. Even Attorney General William P. Barr, who embraces a maximalist ideology of executive power, testified during his confirmation hearing that if a president pardoned someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, \u201cthat would be a crime.\u201d",

Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign manager who was demoted in July, claimed in a Fox News interview on Tuesday night that President Trump would have handily won the election if he had expressed more empathy about the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe lost suburban families,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cI think that goes to one thing: the decision on Covid to go for opening the economy versus public empathy.\u201d He added, \u201cI think if he had been publicly empathetic, he would have won.\u201d Mr. Parscale also appeared to blame those who succeeded him in running Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for failing to file lawsuits before Election Day. In fact, the campaign filed multiple lawsuits during the early voting period seeking to block mail-in ballot rule changes. \u201cI wanted lawyers everywhere,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cWhy, during the early voting days, why weren\u2019t they already getting in there and filing lawsuits? Why are we doing it post?\u201d At other points in the interview, Mr. Parscale refused to concede that the president had lost the election, claiming that Mr. Trump was \u201cin a position that he might be able to pull this off.\u201d  Mr. Parscale has kept a low profile since September, when he was hospitalized after his wife, Candice, called the police saying he was in his house with guns and threatening to hurt himself. According to a police report, Ms. Parscale also said her husband had bruised her arms during \u201da physical altercation.\u201d She later walked back the claim of domestic abuse. Since that episode, which was caught on police body camera footage, Mr. Parscale has claimed he wants to go back to a simpler, more private life flipping real estate. He has told friends he wants to leave politics. Current and former Trump officials on Tuesday interpreted Mr. Parscale\u2019s re-emergence as an attempt to increase the value of a memoir he is also trying to sell and to ingratiate himself with the president. Mr. Parscale said in the Fox interview that he had not spoken to Mr. Trump recently, and that the fracturing of their relationship was \u201cpretty hurtful.\u201d \u201cI gave every inch of my life to them,\u201d he said of the Trump family. \u201cEvery inch.\u201d At another point in the interview, he claimed that he was a \u201csemi-quasi campaign manager\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s winning 2016 campaign, alongside Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. In fact, Kellyanne Conway, a former White House official, was the president\u2019s campaign manager four years ago. \u201cThe worst thing to ever do was to break us two up,\u201d Mr. Parscale said of his relationship with Mr. Kushner, claiming that the president\u2019s son-in-law was also \u201cslightly sidelined\u201d after his demotion. Addressing the altercation in September for the first time, Mr. Parscale hinted at strains in his marriage but did not address the abuse allegation. Martha MacCallum, the Fox News host who conducted the interview, did not ask him about it. \u201cWe lost two children during the election,\u201d Mr. Parscale said, referring to the death of their twins in 2016. \u201cWe were completely attacked by the left, the right, the media. And I got to a bad place.\u201d He said that he and his wife had \u201cnever been happier,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I moved on.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Who Has Been Pardoned by Trump So Far? According to the Justice Department, President Trump has granted clemency to dozens of people during his term in office, including pardoning his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn in November. Mr. Trump has commuted the sentences of just 11 people, after receiving more than 8,500 petitions for commutations, the department said. President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of 1,715 people during his two terms in office, having received more than 33,000 requests, while President George W. Bush commuted the sentences of 11, with more than 8,500 requests. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution gives presidents unlimited authority to grant pardons, which excuse or forgive a federal crime. A commutation, by contrast, makes a punishment milder without wiping out the underlying conviction. Here are some of the pardons and commutations issued by Mr. Trump: Pardon: Nov. 25, 2020 Michael T. Flynn, a former national security adviser who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with a Russian diplomat, and whose prosecution Attorney General William P. Barr tried to shut down, was the only White House official to be convicted as part of the Trump-Russia investigation. In a statement about Mr. Flynn\u2019s pardon, White House officials said he never should have been prosecuted and that the president\u2019s action had finally brought \u201cto an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.\u201d Commutation: July 10, 2020 Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime friend and adviser of Mr. Trump, was sentenced in February 2020 to more than three years in prison in a politically fraught case that put the president at odds with his attorney general. Mr. Stone was convicted of seven felony charges, including lying under oath to a congressional committee and threatening a witness whose testimony would have exposed those lies. In a statement, the White House denounced the \u201coverzealous prosecutors\u201d who had convicted Mr. Stone on \u201cprocess-based charges\u201d stemming from the \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and \u201cRussia hoax\u201d investigation.  Pardon: Aug. 25, 2017 Joe Arpaio, an anti-immigration crusader who enjoyed calling himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff,\u201d was the first pardon of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Once one of the most popular \u2014 and divisive \u2014 figures in Arizona, Mr. Arpaio was elected sheriff of Maricopa County five times before he was ultimately charged with criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop detaining people solely on the suspicion that they were undocumented immigrants. Mr. Arpaio was pardoned less than a month after he was found guilty. Pardon: May 15, 2019 Conrad M. Black, a former press baron and friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was granted a full pardon 12 years after his sentencing for fraud and obstruction of justice. Mr. Black, who once owned The Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and The Daily Telegraph of London, among other newspapers, was convicted of fraud in 2007 with three other former executives of Hollinger International.  Mr. Black, who was released from prison in 2012, is the author of several pro-Trump opinion articles as well as a flattering book, \u201cDonald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.\u201d COMMUTATION: Feb. 18, 2020 Former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was sentenced in 2011 to 14 years in prison for trying to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Mr. Obama vacated after he was elected president.  In 2010, while Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial, he was a contestant on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d a reality TV series hosted by Mr. Trump. Mr. Blagojevich was fired at the end of that season\u2019s fourth episode. Pardon: May 31, 2018 Dinesh D\u2019Souza received a presidential pardon after pleading guilty to making illegal campaign contributions in 2014. Mr. D\u2019Souza, a filmmaker and author whose subjects often dabble in conspiracy theories, had long blamed his conviction on his political opposition to Mr. Obama. In issuing his pardon, Mr. Trump said that Mr. D\u2019Souza had been \u201ctreated very unfairly by our government,\u201d echoing a claim the commentator has often made himself. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion plot. Mr. DeBartolo was prosecuted after he gave Edwin W. Edwards, the influential former governor of Louisiana, $400,000 to secure a riverboat gambling license for his gambling consortium. Although Mr. DeBartolo avoided prison, he was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L. commutation: June 6, 2018; Pardon: Aug. 28, 2019 Alice Marie Johnson was serving life in a federal prison for a nonviolent drug conviction before her case was brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West. The president\u2019s decision to commute her sentence freed Ms. Johnson, who had been locked up in Alabama since 1996 on charges related to cocaine distribution and money laundering. Mr. Trump later pardoned Ms. Johnson on Aug. 28, 2019. Pardons: 2018-20 Mr. Trump has issued posthumous pardons to three historical figures. Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, was tarnished by a racially tainted criminal conviction in 1913 \u2014 for transporting a white woman across state lines \u2014 that haunted him well after his death in 1946. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 24, 2018. Susan B. Anthony, the women\u2019s suffragist, was arrested in Rochester, N.Y., in 1872 for voting illegally and was fined $100. Mr. Trump pardoned her on Aug. 18, the 100th anniversary of the ratification of 19th Amendment, which extended voting rights to women. Zay Jeffries, a metal scientist whose contributions to the Manhattan Project and whose development of armor-piercing artillery shells helped the Allies win World War II, was granted a posthumous pardon on Oct. 10, 2019. Jeffries was found guilty in 1948 of an antitrust violation related to his work and was fined $2,500. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Ten years ago, Bernard B. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to eight felony charges, including tax fraud and lying to White House officials.  Mr. Trump said he heard from more than a dozen people about pardoning Mr. Kerik, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Mr. Kerik\u2019s rise to prominence dates to the 1993 campaign for mayor in New York City, when he served as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s bodyguard and chauffeur. After the pardon was announced, Mr. Kerik expressed his gratitude to Mr. Trump on Twitter. \u201cWith the exception of the birth of my children,\u201d he wrote, \u201ctoday is one of the greatest days in my life.\u201d Pardon: April 13, 2018 I. Lewis Libby Jr., known as Scooter, was Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s top adviser before Mr. Libby was convicted in 2007 of four felony counts, including perjury and obstruction of justice, in connection with the disclosure of the identity of a C.I.A. officer, Valerie Plame. Mr. Libby had maintained his innocence for years, and his portrayal as a victim of an unfair prosecution ultimately found favor with Mr. Trump. Pardon: Nov. 15, 2019 Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to clear three members of the armed services who had been accused or convicted of war crimes signaled that the president intended to use his power as the ultimate arbiter of military justice. He ordered full pardons of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant who was serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians, and Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. The president also reversed the demotion of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who had been acquitted of murder charges but convicted of a lesser offense in a high-profile war crimes case. All three had been championed by prominent conservatives who had portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat and confusion of battle. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Michael R. Milken was the billionaire \u201cjunk bond king\u201d and a well-known financier on Wall Street in the 1980s. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, though his sentence was later reduced to two. He also agreed to pay $600 million in fines and penalties.  Mr. Milken did not have a pardon or commutation application pending at the Justice Department\u2019s pardons office, meaning that the president made that decision entirely without official department input. Among those arguing for Mr. Milken to be pardoned was Mr. Giuliani, who as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted Mr. Milken. Pardon: July 10, 2018 Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond, were Oregon cattle ranchers who had been serving five-year sentences for arson on federal land. Their cases inspired an antigovernment group\u2019s weekslong standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 and brought widespread attention to anger over federal land management in the Western United States. The occupation, led by the Bundy family, drew militia members who commandeered government buildings and vehicles in tactical gear and long guns, promising to defend the family. During his campaign, Mr. Trump played to that sense of Western grievance, and the pardon of the Hammonds was a signal to conservatives that he was sympathetic. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 David H. Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, was sentenced in 2009 to a year in prison for covering up his ties to Jack Abramoff, the disgraced lobbyist whose corruption became a symbol of the excesses of Washington influence peddling. Mr. Safavian was convicted of obstruction of justice and making false statements. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Angela Stanton \u2014 an author, television personality and motivational speaker \u2014 served six months of home confinement in 2007 for her role in a stolen-vehicle ring. Her book \u201cLife of a Real Housewife\u201d explores her difficult upbringing and her encounters with reality TV stars. Before her pardon, she gave interviews in which she declared her support for Mr. Trump. In announcing her pardon, the White House credited her with working \u201ctirelessly to improve re-entry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release from prison.\u201d Mr. Trump has pardoned a number of other people, including a construction executive whose family donated heavily to the president\u2019s re-election effort and a man convicted of bank robbery who started a nonprofit that helps former prisoners. Paul Pogue, a former owner of a Texas construction company, was pardoned on Feb. 18, 2020, for tax charges after his family contributed more than $200,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election effort. Ariel Friedler, a former executive of a software development company who pleaded guilty to conspiring to hack a competitor, secured a pardon on Feb. 18, 2020, with the help of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and a close ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Michael Chase Behenna, a former Army lieutenant, served five years in prison for fatally shooting an Iraqi man in American custody in 2008. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 6, 2019. His case had \u201cattracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public,\u201d according to the White House. Patrick James Nolan, a Republican former leader of the California State Assembly, pleaded guilty in 1994 to corruption charges and accepted a 33-month sentence. After his release, he became a supporter of criminal justice reform, according to the White House. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 15, 2019. Michael Anthony Tedesco, who was convicted of drug trafficking and fraud in 1990, was pardoned on July 29, 2019. President Obama had already pardoned Mr. Tedesco in 2017, but Mr. Trump\u2019s action fixed a clerical error related to the pardoning of Mr. Tedesco\u2019s fraud conviction. Roy Wayne McKeever was arrested on charges of transporting marijuana from Mexico to Oklahoma in 1989, when he was 19, and was sentenced to one year in prison. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. A White House statement called him \u201can active member of the Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Texas.\u201d John Richard Bubala pleaded guilty to the improper use of federal property in 1990 and was pardoned on July 29, 2019. A White House statement said Mr. Bubala had been transferring automotive equipment to an Indiana town for maintenance and his \u201cprimary aim was to help the town.\u201d Chalmer Lee Williams was an airport baggage handler who was convicted on charges related to the theft and sale of weapons and was sentenced to four months in prison in 1995. The White House said in a statement that Mr. Williams had accepted responsibility for his actions. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. Rodney M. Takumi, who was arrested while working at an illegal gambling parlor in 1987, pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $250. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. The White House said Mr. Takumi was the owner of a tax preparation franchise in the Navajo Nation. Jon Donyae Ponder, who pleaded guilty to bank robbery in 2005, started a nonprofit that helps former prisoners after he was released from prison in 2009. Mr. Trump pardoned him on Aug. 25, 2020, shortly before the Republican National Convention entered its second night. The pardon was announced in a seven-minute video in which the president called Mr. Ponder\u2019s life \u201ca beautiful testament to the power of redemption.\u201d Christina Morales contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "As Trump Rages, Voters in a Key County Move On: \u2018I\u2019m Not Sweating It\u2019 DOYLESTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Even before the presidential transition was underway, Mike Carr had started to move on with his life. It\u2019s not as though much about American politics had changed in the immediate aftermath of the election, he noted. President Trump was still tweeting baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud in all caps; cable news panels were still debating the effect the frenzy of accusations would have on democracy. These were the kinds of things that, before the election, would have demanded Mr. Carr\u2019s full attention. For most of the president\u2019s term, Mr. Carr, a 53-year-old real estate lawyer, had been relentlessly attuned to the news cycle and the damage he felt Mr. Trump had done to the country. But ever since Nov. 7, when the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Carr has given himself permission to keep the television on mute. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight has been lifted,\u201d said Mr. Carr, who voted a straight Democratic ticket on Nov. 3, as he did in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice not to be as plugged in.\u201d In Bucks County, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia and one of the state\u2019s most consistently competitive counties down ballot, ardent Biden supporters like Mr. Carr could be forgiven for not unplugging entirely. Their candidate may have won their state by 1.2 percentage points, their county by more than four, but Mr. Trump and his legal team have continued to dispute the results, filing multiple lawsuits, losing multiple lawsuits and parroting unfounded allegations of fraud in the parking lot of a landscaping business not 45 minutes away. By trying to sow distrust in America\u2019s electoral infrastructure and egging on his advisers as they speak openly of a second term, Mr. Trump has confirmed some of his detractors\u2019 worst fears. Yet even in a state at the center of the president\u2019s attacks, in a county where pre-election tensions ran high, many Biden supporters find themselves increasingly comfortable tuning out, moving on and looking forward to January. As in other counties across Pennsylvania and the country, Bucks County has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with about 64 residents dying from the virus in November, the highest toll since the spring. For many voters here, worries about the virus, coupled with an overwhelming sense of Trump fatigue, have relegated the president to little more than a postelection footnote. Sure, these voters acknowledged, Mr. Trump may still hold the power of the presidency and may, in their estimation, have no qualms about abusing it. But when it comes to the results of the election, they\u2019ve taken to viewing his message as more of a nuisance with a sell-by date than a lasting danger to democracy \u2014 the rantings of a sore loser rather than the opening act of a coup by the leader of the free world. \u201cHe\u2019s just a whiny kid who didn\u2019t get his way. I\u2019m not sweating it,\u201d said Blake Lertzman, 39, while taking a smoke break outside his technology repair shop in the Bucks County seat of Doylestown. \u201cRight now it\u2019s all about the virus. I worry about me and my girlfriend and my community.\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent efforts to overturn the election, \u201cnobody cares,\u201d Mr. Lertzman went on, \u201cunless you\u2019re the kind of person who goes on Newsmax.\u201d Doylestown, which has about 8,300 residents and is over 90 percent white, leans further left than many other boroughs and townships in Bucks County. Nevertheless, many residents take pride in their region as an incubator of centrist politics, citing the county\u2019s record, for instance, of voting for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 while helping re-elect Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican. Republicans and Democrats alike here recall Mike Fitzpatrick, the moderate Republican congressman who died of brain cancer this year, with fondness. And while many Democrats lament that his brother and successor, Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 a Republican who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s First District and just won re-election by 13 points \u2014 voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, they will also note unprompted that Mr. Fitzpatrick was recently ranked by the Lugar Center, a nonprofit in Washington, as the most bipartisan member of the House. \u201cWe generally produce candidates in both parties that are pretty moderate,\u201d said Ron Strouse, the mayor of Doylestown, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cpractical progressive.\u201d \u201cThe history of ticket-splitting certainly showed this year.\u201d Still, like a number of other self-consciously moderate locales across America, Bucks County was not insulated from the partisan and cultural crosscurrents that defined the presidential election. And as the county seat, Doylestown played host to their suburban Philadelphia iteration. \u201cRallies, counter-rallies, protests, demonstrations \u2014 we\u2019ve had more than 45 since the beginning of this year alone,\u201d Mr. Strouse said. In early September, hundreds gathered in the borough for dueling Black Lives Matter and \u201cBack the Blue\u201d demonstrations, the latter of which included a sea of Trump merchandise and a man reportedly shouting racial slurs and displaying a Nazi salute. In October, as part of a pro-Trump \u201croad rally,\u201d more than 1,000 of the president\u2019s supporters clogged traffic for miles as they converged on Doylestown, where they were met by a counter-demonstration of Biden supporters. Local businesses boarding up in anticipation of summer protests, Trump supporters brandishing Confederate flags as they cruised down Main Street: Doylestown residents recited no shortage of ways their typically placid borough had seemed \u201ctense\u201d in the lead-up to the election. But in the weeks since, even as Mr. Trump has electrified much of his base with his false claims of fraud and his campaign\u2019s harried appeals via text to \u201cchip in $10\u201d to \u201cSTOP THE RADICAL Left from counting any ILLEGAL ballots,\u201d Doylestown has remained at a calm remove. Demonstrations by Trump and Biden supporters alike, once a near-constant presence across town, have ground to a halt. \u201cPeople are more willing to tune out the theater now,\u201d said Anthony Palazzolo, 30, who is a volunteer at the Doylestown Historical Society and a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it in small things, like people are less on their phones and interacting more on the sidewalks. People are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d According to Mr. Palazzolo and others, the growing sang-froid about Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy-mongering, even among the area\u2019s most ardent Democrats, is in part a credit to local party leadership, members of which were quick to present a unified front after the county\u2019s votes were tabulated \u2014 offering Bucks County residents a bipartisan show of confidence in their own results even as the president tried to seed doubt and promote division across the state. \u201cOur county had a great election, and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d said Pat Poprick, the chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee. \u201cI do not think there was any quote-unquote fraud here.\u201d Yet for all their fears of Mr. Trump, many Biden supporters here also expressed confidence that the country\u2019s democratic institutions and traditions were robust enough to withstand the president\u2019s attempts to subvert them \u2014 if only for two more months. Larissa Hopwood, 41, a children\u2019s musician and teacher, was among Mr. Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters in Doylestown, taking the lead in organizing pro-Biden rallies to counteract the steady stream of Trump demonstrations. Ms. Hopwood said the stakes of the presidential election could not have felt higher, particularly because she is the mother of a gender nonconforming child. The day after the election, she attended a \u201cProtect the Results\u201d rally in town. But armed with a confidence that, come Jan. 20, Mr. Biden will be president of the United States, no matter how many lawsuits Mr. Trump files, she has found herself embracing a new sense of lightness, however incrementally. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize it for awhile, but for a week after Biden won, I posted zero Instagrams,\u201d she said. \u201cI think my mind-set was, \u2018Let\u2019s just tune it out: We had our victory.\u2019\u201d Still, despite feeling perhaps a bit less compelled to post and engage daily with political content, she admitted being frustrated by how \u201cpuffy\u201d her social feeds seemed shortly after the election \u2014 posts about lighter topics like, say, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d or People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover. But any concerns about complacency among fellow progressives seemed to stem less from concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s language and actions in this moment, and more from a desire to maintain momentum heading into the Biden era. In other words, Ms. Hopwood said, she\u2019s not terribly worried that a presidential coup is afoot. \u201cThere are government employees in charge of making this transition happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we are still the United States.\u201d And ultimately, for Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters here, blocking out the president is all the easier when even the neighborhood\u2019s most outspoken Trump supporter seems to have moved on. Daniel Compain, 65, a Cuban-American who fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime as a child, beamed as he recalled how pedestrians would grimace as they passed the enormous Trump flag he\u2019d hung outside the window of his apartment near Main Street. In an interview at a Starbucks nearby, he maintained that he would not accept the results of the election until the Electoral College officially voted in mid-December. He also had questions, he said, about whether Dominion voting machines had deleted ballots cast for Mr. Trump, echoing false claims made by the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. And yet when asked why he had decided to take his Trump flag down, Mr. Compain responded as if the answer were self-evident. \u201cWell, the election is over,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Cabinet Picks, Part 2: Antony Blinken What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump? Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak \u2014 a position influenced by hearing the stories of his stepfather, a holocaust survivor, and by witnessing, when part of the Clinton administration, the consequences of not having intervened earlier to stop the Rwandan genocide. But some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend. If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States is back and can be counted on. What course is he likely to steer through that narrow channel? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent for The New York Times. Mr. Blinken\u2019s extensive foreign policy credentials are expected to help calm American diplomats and global leaders after four years of the Trump administration\u2019s ricocheting strategies and nationalist swaggering. European allies of the United States have welcomed a president who doesn\u2019t see them as rivals. But with the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate, they are also wary. Mr. Biden wants to reactivate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but the killing of the top nuclear scientist in the Middle Eastern nation, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, could complicate that aim.

    "article_text": "Barr Acknowledges Justice Dept. Has Found No Widespread Voter Fraud WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged on Tuesday that the Justice Department has uncovered no voting fraud \u201con a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,\u201d a striking repudiation of President Trump\u2019s groundless claims that he was defrauded. The statement from Mr. Barr affirming Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s win served as a particularly harsh blow to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the election. Mr. Barr has advanced Mr. Trump\u2019s political agenda perhaps more than any other cabinet member, bringing the Justice Department as close to the White House as it has been since Watergate. His comments came as other Republicans separated themselves on Tuesday from Mr. Trump\u2019s charged complaints about the election. A Georgia elections official angrily denounced the violent threats and harassment directed at elections workers and urged the president to \u201cstop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to get hurt,\u201d the official, Gabriel Sterling, said at a news conference. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to get shot. Someone\u2019s going to get killed.\u201d And Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has refused to recognize Mr. Trump\u2019s election loss, moved closer to overtly accepting the reality that Mr. Biden would be in the White House next year as he discussed the prospects for more pandemic stimulus in 2021. \u201cAfter the first of the year, there is likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year, depending upon what the new administration wants to pursue,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Capitol Hill. Mr. Barr had been mostly silent since the election, but some Republicans privately pushed him to publicly rebut Mr. Trump, according to a person told of those conversations. His comments may have been prompted by Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly specious election claims; the president suggested on Sunday that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. may have played a role in an election fraud. Mr. Barr took particular aim at a widely discredited conspiracy theory promoted by the president\u2019s legal team involving machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, a company that sells voting hardware. \u201cThere\u2019s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud, and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the D.H.S. and D.O.J. have looked into that, and so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that,\u201d Mr. Barr said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security and his own department. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Mr. Barr discussed his findings on voter fraud with the White House before he made his public comments on Tuesday. Mr. Barr\u2019s acknowledgment of the election results was an about-face from his posture during the campaign. But he spoke out only after the president spent weeks promoting baseless assertions about the election outcome and long after department lawyers assigned to monitor elections for signs of fraud told Mr. Barr that they had found no evidence of substantial irregularities. And even as Mr. Barr distanced himself from the president\u2019s election claims, the Justice Department also announced a move certain to please Mr. Trump: Mr. Barr has given additional protections to John H. Durham, the federal prosecutor whose examination of the Russia investigation Mr. Trump had embraced. The move makes it more difficult for the Biden administration to fire Mr. Durham without providing evidence of misconduct. The president\u2019s allies immediately pushed back on Mr. Barr\u2019s election assessment. Trump campaign lawyers complained that the Justice Department investigations had been anemic. Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr. Trump who has been at the forefront of promoting his election conspiracy theories, said that his team had gathered evidence of illegal voting in six states, backed up by sworn witness\u00a0statements, and that the Justice Department had failed to investigate what the team had uncovered.\u00a0 \u201cAs far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the D.O.J.,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department also hasn\u2019t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\u201d Mr. Barr had given prosecutors the authority to examine allegations by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies of voter ineligibility in Nevada and improperly dated mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. The results of those investigations have not been publicly disclosed, but Mr. Barr\u2019s remarks suggested that any impropriety was too insignificant to change the election results. \u201cMost claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations, and those have been run down; they are being run down,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d The Trump campaign and its surrogates have filed dozens of lawsuits in battleground states that have offered an array of attacks on the election results: arguing that mail-in ballots were illegally used, that absentee ballots were improperly counted and that poll challengers were denied proper access to monitor vote counts. Some of the lawsuits have echoed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s talk of conspiracies that foreign powers like Venezuela worked with corrupt American officials to manipulate voting machines. Others made much smaller claims, contesting the validity of tiny batches of as few as 60 ballots. But none, at least so far, have won Mr. Trump anything more significant than the ability to move his poll observers from 10 feet to six feet away from workers counting votes in Pennsylvania. The campaign and its allies have now lost nearly 40 cases across the country as judge after judge \u2014 including some appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 discredited the efforts as lacking both legal merit and convincing proof. Mr. Barr also suggested that lawsuits or audits by elections officials served as remedies for suspicions of election irregularities, not criminal inquiries. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don\u2019t like something, they want the Department of Justice to come in and \u2018investigate,\u2019\u201d Mr. Barr said in the Associated Press interview. Mr. Barr has potentially placed himself in a precarious position with Mr. Trump, who recently fired Christopher Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official responsible for securing the presidential election, who prominently disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims that the presidency was stolen. \u201cI guess he is the next one to be fired since he now, too, says there is no fraud,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, said of Mr. Barr. The attorney general traveled to the White House on Tuesday afternoon, prompting speculation about his future, but he was there to attend a previously scheduled meeting, a spokeswoman said. In the months before the November election, Mr. Barr had been one of the loudest voices sounding alarms about widespread fraud, claiming repeatedly in speeches and interviews that the potential for it was high and that it posed a grave danger to the election. Mr. Barr\u2019s claims were often false or exaggerated and were widely refuted. Predicting in September that mail-in voting would lead to unprecedented voter fraud, he called his assertion \u201ccommon sense.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have empirical evidence other than the fact that we\u2019ve always had voting fraud,\u201d Mr. Barr said at the time. \u201cAnd there always will be people who attempt to do that.\u201d His comments unnerved Democrats and voting rights advocates as he simultaneously relaxed Justice Department guidelines that discouraged prosecutors from taking investigative steps around an election that could become public and undermine Americans\u2019 confidence in the results. In the weeks before the election, the Justice Department also made the highly unusual move of releasing details about voter fraud investigations, which fed Mr. Trump\u2019s narrative warning of voting irregularities in an effort to erode voters\u2019 faith in the outcome of the race.

    "article_text": "\u2018It Has to Stop\u2019: Georgia Election Official Lashes Trump ATLANTA \u2014 In one of the most striking rebukes to President Trump since he launched his baseless attacks on the American electoral process, a top-ranking Georgia election official lashed out at the president on Tuesday for failing to condemn threats of violence against people overseeing the voting system in his state. \u201cIt has to stop,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said at an afternoon news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with emotion. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It\u2019s too much.\u201d Mr. Sterling\u2019s outburst of anger and frustration came amid a sustained assault on Georgia\u2019s election process by Mr. Trump as he seeks to reverse his loss to his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Sterling, who previously said he had received threats himself, said that threats had also been made against the wife of his superior, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. \u201cMr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. He added that the president needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and say, \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed. And it\u2019s not right.\u201d Mr. Sterling also called on the state\u2019s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to condemn the rhetoric that he said was getting dangerously out of hand. The two senators, both Trump loyalists, have called for Mr. Raffensperger to resign. As Mr. Trump hurls false claims of fraud in Georgia, a number of lawsuits filed by conservatives in state and federal courts are seeking to decertify the results. The second of two recounts requested by the Trump campaign is in progress and is expected to wind up Wednesday. And the Georgia Republican Party has descended into a state of virtual civil war as some of its most powerful players maneuver and malign their rivals, seeking advantage, or at least survival. In the meantime, Mr. Trump continues to lash out at Gov. Brian Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, both staunch Republicans and Trump supporters, over the fact that he lost Georgia, saying they have not sufficiently rooted out fraud. As late as Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump made the latest in a series of unsubstantiated claims about the Georgia election, writing on Twitter that the state had been \u201cscammed\u201d and urging Mr. Kemp to \u201ccall off\" the election. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have taken to the streets and the Capitol building in downtown Atlanta, where the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars recently joined them. In other cases, Trump supporters have harassed or threatened Mr. Sterling, Mr. Raffensperger and others. In a statement Tuesday evening, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign is focused on ensuring that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not. No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.\u201d Amid all of this, Mr. Sterling, a detail-oriented former city councilman from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, has taken on a prominent role in the state as it conducted its recounts. Along with Mr. Raffensperger, he has often been the main speaker in numerous news conferences in which he has explained the complexities of Georgia\u2019s election and recount systems and has argued that the results, which currently show Mr. Biden winning by about 12,700 votes, are trustworthy. Ari Schaffer, press secretary for the secretary of state\u2019s office, did not answer directly when asked Tuesday whether Mr. Raffensperger had given Mr. Sterling his blessing to speak out so forcefully against the president. But he noted that the deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, had been standing near Mr. Sterling when he made his statements. \u201cGabriel has my support,\u201d Ms. Fuchs said independently in a text message. Late Tuesday, representatives for Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue said they condemned violence of any kind but also said they would not apologize for seeking accountability and accuracy in the state\u2019s elections.  In the second of two news conferences called by the secretary of state\u2019s office on Tuesday, Mr. Sterling, speaking loudly, emotionally and deliberately, said that people had intruded on Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s personal property. He said that Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s wife \u201cis getting sexualized threats through her cellphone.\u201d He mentioned that he had police protection outside his own house, a topic he had also broached in a Nov. 21 tweet. \u201cSo this is fun \u2026 multiple attempted hacks of my emails, police protection around my home, the threats,\u201d Mr. Sterling wrote then. \u201cBut all is well \u2026 following the law, following the process \u2026 doing our jobs.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Sterling also made references to reports that Joe diGenova, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, had said that Chris Krebs \u2014 a former federal cybersecurity official who vouched that the election was clean \u2014 should be shot. (Mr. diGenova later said his remarks had been \u201cmade in jest.\u201d) But Mr. Sterling said that \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d had involved a threat against a 20-year-old contractor for a voting system company in Gwinnett County. He said the young worker had been targeted by someone who hung a noose and declared that the worker should be \u201chung for treason,\u201d simply for doing a routine element of his job. Mr. Sterling did not provide any other details. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.\u201d Details of the noose incident Mr. Sterling cited could not be corroborated Tuesday. Cpl. Ryan Winderweedle, a spokesman for the Gwinnett County Police Department, said that he did not have any information about such an incident but noted that it could have occurred beyond that department\u2019s jurisdiction. Joe Sorenson, a spokesman for the county government, said in an email that \u201ccitizen monitors\u201d had \u201charassed\u201d some county technology workers who were doing work that was unrelated to the elections but that involved going in and out of a storage area in the same building as the county elections office.

    "article_text": "Justice Dept. Investigating Potential Bribery Scheme for Trump Pardon The Justice Department has been investigating whether intermediaries for a federal convict offered White House officials a bribe in exchange for a potential pardon or commutation from President Trump, according to court documents unsealed by a federal judge on Tuesday. The documents were heavily redacted, and it was unclear who may have been involved. Nothing directly tied Mr. Trump to the scheme, and the documents said no one had been charged. But the documents offered a few clues about what the White House may have known about the scheme. One passage appears to show that a lawyer for the convict had discussions with the White House Counsel\u2019s Office about a pardon or commutation, but it was unclear whether the discussions were part of the scheme or a normal back-and-forth with the White House about a convict\u2019s case. Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump used Twitter to briefly address the disclosure of the investigation, calling it \u201cFake News.\u201d The information about the potential scheme was included in an opinion, dated Aug. 28, from the chief United States district judge for the District of Columbia, Beryl A. Howell, who was weighing whether to allow federal prosecutors to examine evidence \u2014 like emails \u2014 that may have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell granted the prosecutors access to the materials. Investigators suspected that the convict seeking the pardon was imprisoned as recently as this summer and that two people working on behalf of the convict may have undertaken a secret lobbying campaign by approaching White House officials, according to the documents. The two people may have offered to funnel money as political donations in exchange for the pardon or commutation, although it was unclear where the money was supposed to be sent. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s undisciplined approach to pardons, the disclosure, coming amid a flurry of reports about how Mr. Trump has been discussing whether to pardon his children and close confidants in the final weeks of his presidency, raised fears that the pardon process may have been corrupted. Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn on Wednesday, and had talks with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani last week about a pre-emptive pardon for Mr. Giuliani before he leaves office. The president has also had discussions with advisers about how he fears that a Biden Justice Department could seek retribution against him by prosecuting his children.",

    "article_text": "Trump Has Discussed With Advisers Pardons for His 3 Eldest Children and Giuliani President Trump has discussed with advisers whether to grant pre-emptive pardons to his children, to his son-in-law and to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and talked with Mr. Giuliani about pardoning him as recently as last week, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has told others that he is concerned that a Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump \u2014 as well as Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser. Donald Trump Jr. had been under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for contacts that the younger Mr. Trump had had with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, but he was never charged. Mr. Kushner provided false information to federal authorities about his contacts with foreigners for his security clearance, but was given one anyway by the president. The nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about any potential criminal exposure of Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump is unclear, although an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the Trump Organization has expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees by the company, some of which appear to have gone to Ms. Trump. Presidential pardons, however, do not provide protection against state or local crimes. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s potential criminal exposure is also unclear, although he was under investigation as recently as this summer by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for his business dealings in Ukraine and his role in ousting the American ambassador there. The plot was at the heart of the impeachment of Mr. Trump. The speculation about pardon activity at the White House is churning furiously, underscoring how much the Trump administration has been dominated by investigations and criminal prosecutions of people in the president\u2019s orbit. Mr. Trump himself was singled out by federal prosecutors as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in a court filing in the case that sent Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to prison. The discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani occurred as the former New York mayor has become one of the loudest voices pushing baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump still proclaims publicly that he won. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime aides have refused to do his bidding to try to overturn an election that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. won by nearly seven million votes. But Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly thrust himself into the spotlight to cast doubt on the results, which has ingratiated him with the president. ABC News reported earlier on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was considering pardoning family members. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a message seeking comment, but after a version of this article was published online, he attacked it on Twitter and said it was false. Christiann\u00e9 L. Allen, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Giuliani \u201ccannot comment on any discussions that he has with his client.\u201d And Mr. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, said, \u201cHe\u2019s not concerned about this investigation because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and that\u2019s been our position from Day 1.\u201d The Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said on Monday that given the animosity from Democrats directed at Mr. Trump, the president should consider pardoning his entire family. \u201cIf Biden ever became president, I\u2019d tell Trump pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Mr. Hannity told his viewers. Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of Fox News, particularly Mr. Hannity\u2019s show. Such a broad pardon pre-empting any charge or conviction is highly unusual but does have precedent. In the most famous example, President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon for all of his actions as president. President George Washington pardoned plotters of the Whiskey Rebellion, shielding them from treason prosecutions. And President Jimmy Carter pardoned thousands of American men who illegally avoided the draft for the Vietnam War. Mr. Trump has wielded his clemency powers liberally in cases that resonate with him personally or for people who have a direct line to him through friends or family, while thousands of other cases await his review. A pardon for Mr. Giuliani is certain to prompt accusations that Mr. Trump has used his pardon power to obstruct investigations and insulate himself and his allies. Andrew A. Weissmann, a top prosecutor for Mr. Mueller, has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangling of pardons for his allies impeded their work. In July, the president commuted the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., who had refused to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigators and was eventually convicted of seven felonies. Last week, Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who had backed out of his cooperation agreement with the special counsel\u2019s office for \u201cany and all possible offenses\u201d beyond the charge he had faced of lying to federal investigators. The Flynn pardon raised expectations that Mr. Trump would bestow clemency on other associates \u2014 like his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who refused to discuss matters from the 2016 election with prosecutors \u2014 in his final weeks in office. Mr. Giuliani has asked Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to pay him $20,000 a day for his work on trying to overturn the election, a figure that would make him among the most highly paid lawyers in the world. The staggering sum has stirred opposition among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides who worry that Mr. Giuliani has perpetuated the claims of election fraud in hopes of making as much money as possible. Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern that any federal investigations of his conduct that appear to have been dormant under the Trump administration could be revived in a Biden administration, according to people who have spoken to him. Legal experts say that if Mr. Trump wants to fully protect Mr. Giuliani from prosecution after he leaves office, the president would most likely have to detail in the language of the pardon what crimes he believed Mr. Giuliani had committed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have since 2019 been investigating the role of Mr. Giuliani and two other associates in a wide-ranging pressure campaign directed at pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, namely Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. President Trump\u00a0has discussed potential pardons\u00a0that could test the boundaries of his constitutional power to nullify criminal liability. Here\u2019s some clarity on his ability to pardon. The two Giuliani associates \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were arrested in October 2019 as they prepared to board a flight from Washington to Frankfurt with one-way tickets. They were charged with violating campaign finance laws as part of a complex scheme to undermine the former American ambassador in Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump believed should have been doing more to pressure the Ukrainians. Prosecutors in Manhattan continued to investigate Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the scheme over the past year, focusing on whether he was, in pushing to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, essentially double dipping: working not only for Mr. Trump but also for Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador gone for their own reasons, according to people briefed on the matter. It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign official without disclosing their involvement. Mr. Giuliani has said that he did nothing wrong and that he did not register as a foreign agent because he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not any Ukrainians. Even as Mr. Trump maintains that the election was stolen and files lawsuits aimed at delaying its certification, his White House is preparing for the final stages of his presidency. The end of any administration typically prompts a wave of pardons, particularly when a term has been engulfed in controversy like Mr. Trump\u2019s, in which several people close to him became ensnared in federal investigations. \u201cThe pardon power has been used by many presidents in politically self-serving ways, whether it was George H.W. Bush or Clinton,\u201d said Jack L. Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, citing how Mr. Bush pardoned six of his associates \u2014 including the former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger \u2014 for their role in the Iran-contra affair. \u201cPolitically, a pardon of Giuliani would be explosive,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith added, \u201cbut pardoning pals has been done before.\u201d Under previous administrations, presidents have largely granted pardons after they have gone through a formal review process at the Justice Department, where lawyers examined the convictions, discussed the ramifications of a potential pardon with prosecutors and then provided the White House with recommendations on how to proceed. On several occasions, Mr. Trump has gone against the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations and the advice of his own White House advisers, granting pardons to political allies and celebrities. When presidents have deviated from that process, scandals have occasionally occurred, especially after pardons in the last days of an administration. On the final day of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, he granted a pardon to Marc Rich, a wealthy financier and longtime Democratic donor who was considered a fugitive as he had fled the United States to avoid tax charges. Prosecutors in Manhattan investigated whether the pardon had been part of a quid pro quo, but no one was ever charged. At the time, Mr. Giuliani, who had helped bring criminal charges against Mr. Rich years earlier as a federal prosecutor, was deeply critical of the move, calling it \u201ca disgrace\u201d and declaring it \u201ca midnight pardon.\u201d No president has tried to grant someone a pardon for crimes they have not yet committed \u2014 essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card \u2014 and legal experts say it is unlikely to hold any weight. In the case of Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation examined questions of whether his contacts during the 2016 election with WikiLeaks and Russians offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton amounted to campaign finance violations. Donald Trump Jr. was never interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s office and was never charged. In the case of Mr. Kushner, he omitted several significant contacts with foreigners when he filled out a form for his White House security clearance, including ones with the Russians offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. Under federal law it is a crime to provide inaccurate or incomplete information on the background check documents for security clearances. In 2018, the White House counsel and chief of staff recommended that Mr. Kushner not receive a Top Secret security clearance because of issues that had been discovered during his background check. Over the objections of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, the president unilaterally granted Mr. Kushner the clearance. Ben Protess contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Mark Walker jumps into North Carolina Senate race, hoping to ward off Lara Trump and other potential rivals. WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Mark Walker announced on Tuesday that he would run for North Carolina\u2019s open Senate seat in 2022, kicking off what is likely to be a fierce Republican primary that could pit him against President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law in a key swing state. In an interview, Mr. Walker, a former Baptist pastor from Greensboro, sought to frame himself as a \u201cbridge builder\u201d between Republicans and groups that the party had struggled to reach in recent years, particularly Black voters. \u201cI am trying to make the case you might want to select somebody who has the ability, or the history to work with people from all different communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a track record of going to places and accomplishing things that Republicans have not been able to do.\u201d Mr. Walker, 51, announced last year that he would not seek re-election after a court ordered North Carolina to redraw its congressional map, making his district much more Democratic. He had been mulling a Senate run for months after Senator Richard M. Burr, a fellow Republican, decided to retire. By entering the race just days after North Carolina certified its November elections, Mr. Walker was aiming to potentially box out other Republicans contemplating getting into the race. Other Republicans who are eyeing Mr. Burr\u2019s seat include Lara Trump, the wife of the president\u2019s son Eric Trump; Pat McCrory, the former governor; Representative George Holding, who is also retiring; and Dan Forest, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year. Ms. Trump has told associates that she is considering entering the contest, and her campaign could be a test of the family\u2019s political staying power once Mr. Trump leaves the White House. Despite stylistic differences, Mr. Walker has been a close ally of Mr. Trump in the House and would welcome his support in the Senate contest. Still, he offered a subtle dig on Tuesday at the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who resides in Westchester County but has North Carolina roots. \u201cIf somebody wants to move to the state, legally they can do that, but it doesn\u2019t deter me,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI have nothing to say but good things about their family.\u201d At least one potential contender has already passed on the race. Mark Meadows, another North Carolina conservative and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said last month he would not run for the seat as some expected. Democrats see the seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2022. Erica D. Smith, a state senator has already indicated she will run again, after losing the Democratic primary this year to Cal Cunningham, who fell short in his bid to unseat Senator Thom Tillis. Other possible candidates include Josh Stein, the state\u2019s attorney general, and Jeff Jackson, another state senator.",

    "article_text": "Biden introduces his economic team at a moment of big risks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced key members of his economic team on Tuesday, as he prepares to assume the White House at a moment when the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing and millions remain out of work. Mr. Biden, speaking at an event in Delaware, said he was building \u201ca first-rate team that\u2019s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis.\u201d The president-elect called on Congress to pass a \u201crobust\u201d rescue package to help households, businesses and state and local governments, saying many communities are \u201cteetering on the edge.\u201d Mr. Biden is poised to enter the White House at a time of national crisis amid the worsening virus outbreak. The Department of Labor and Department of Commerce have reported an increase in applications for state jobless benefits and a decrease in personal income. Coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks, a development that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell called \u201cconcerning\u201d in testimony before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it \u201ccould prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d In a sign of how critical a role economic policy will play in the Biden administration, the President-elect said he was returning the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers to a cabinet-level position. President Trump had demoted the C.E.A. chair during his administration. Mr. Biden has chosen Cecilia Rouse to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; she would be the first Black woman in the role. Ms. Rouse is a Princeton economist who worked on the Council of Economic Advisers during part of the Obama era and on the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Mr. Biden has warned of a \u201cvery dark winter\u201d ahead and called on Congress to pass relief to help workers, businesses, and state and local governments. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are preparing for what could be another economic downturn in early 2021. But another economic stimulus package has languished in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach a deal, though leaders of both parties have called for compromise in recent days. A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a potential compromise plan on Tuesday morning that appeared to fit the contours of what Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have said must frame any stimulus deal in Washington. They include additional aid to the unemployed and small businesses, along with money to help state and local governments patch budget holes that have been ripped open during the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s slate of nominees and appointees includes several women in top economic roles. The selections, markedly different from Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has been overwhelmingly white and male, follow Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise to build an administration that looks like America. His pick for the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress \u2014 would be the first Indian-American to lead the office if confirmed. Mr. Biden also selected Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, to be his Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to fill the position. Ms. Tanden has met immediate resistance from Republican senators who have criticized her for attacking Republicans publicly, including on her Twitter feed. She previewed the group\u2019s likely emphasis on personal stories in a Twitter post on Monday, after her nomination was announced: \u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity.\u201d Mr. Biden also announced his picks for deputy treasury secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, and members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Mr. Adeyemo served as a senior international economic adviser under former President Barack Obama, and Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey, a top policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, leads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality. The introductions follow a similar event last week, when Mr. Biden publicly introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team.",

    "article_text": "As uncertainty grows, Congress kick-starts stimulus talks. The country\u2019s economy, like the nation\u2019s politics, is queasily suspended between the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 at a moment when the rampaging pandemic has prompted deep concerns over the strength, timing and even likelihood of a possible recovery next year. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to inject a sense of urgency \u2014 and stability \u2014 into a chaotic postelection environment by formally introducing his economic team, whose governing philosophy marks a stark departure from President Trump\u2019s low-tax, low-regulation approach. \u201cLet\u2019s begin the work to heal, to unite, to rebuild an economy for all Americans,\u201d Mr. Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del.

During his remarks, Mr. Biden directly appealed to senators who will vote on the confirmations of his cabinet members and who are likely to oppose some of his picks. \u201cTo the United States Senate, I hope those outstanding, these outstanding nominees receive a prompt hearing and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country,\u201d said Mr. Biden as he introduced his nominees including Neera Tanden, the combative head of a liberal think tank who is one choice likely to face some opposition. Earlier in the day, current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell backed that approach, warning Congress that \u201cthe outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain\u201d without an effort to bridge the dangerous transition by limiting the spread of the virus and supporting the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s departing Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, offered a much less dire assessment of the economy in his prepared remarks before the Senate Banking Committee. But there were signs that the two sides were attempting to bridge the gap. Mr. Mnuchin told reporters he was planning to reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss negotiations over another virus relief package. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, unveiled the blueprint for a $900 billion stopgap stimulus package later in the day. The plan would provide $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits for 18 weeks, half of what Democrats have sought, and it includes $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, much less than the $500 billion Democrats had previously proposed, which congressional Republicans and the White House had firmly rejected. In his testimony, Mr. Mnuchin proposed spending an additional $300 billion on relief \u2014 a move that was instantly attacked as insufficient by Democratic members of the panel. \u201cI continue to believe that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday. \u201cThe administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses.\u201d Yet even as most congressional Republicans refuse to publicly acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, many in the party are starting to privately adjust to negotiating with a Biden team whose coordinated activity represents a sharp break from Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach that had often involved back-room diplomacy with Democrats beyond the reach of his volatile boss.",

I cannot find tolerance for the \u201cother side.\u201d To date, however, I\u2019ve just kept quiet and avoided the subject with people I know are beyond convincing. Is that adequate? Mimi B. Osiason In a democracy, we the people are supposed to be guiding the ship of state together. To do that, we need to be able to talk to one another, which suggests that engagement, rather than confrontation, can be a civic act. It can also be an act of friendship, because one thing we want to do is to save our friends from making serious mistakes. Just bear in mind that listening in these circumstances is as important as talking. The polarized state of our politics, alas, means that people are so taken up with their political identities that they\u2019re unable or unwilling to consider the views of those outside their political tribe. Conversations on these topics tend to turn up the temperature while dimming the lights. And, given your principles, it\u2019s easy to assume that your Trump-loving friends are morally defective \u2014 that they don\u2019t take cruelty, xenophobia, intemperance, narcissism and dishonesty with due seriousness. Perhaps that\u2019s the case. But perhaps the gulf between you and these friends arises from differences in your epistemic capacities \u2014 the ability to gain reliable information. Our beliefs depend not just on our own brains but also on the social worlds we live in. One way of capturing this truth is what some philosophers have called the extended-mind hypothesis: Our minds don\u2019t simply repose between our ears (the argument goes) but extend into the world around us, a world that may or may not include Fox News, Parler, talk radio, a voluble workplace colleague who has always seemed marvelously in the know, filtered Twitter feeds and the like. What\u2019s obvious is that people can be epistemically disadvantaged by gaining their beliefs from social networks that are radically unreliable. We get many of our false beliefs in the same way we get true ones: by listening to the views of people we trust. You can be partially responsible for being in an unreliable network if there are signs that something is wrong and you don\u2019t examine the possibility that it\u2019s misleading you. But the misjudgment here may not reflect bad moral values. Once the fog of political warfare that surrounds an election has cleared, we could discover that most of our fellow citizens are not irredeemably indifferent to Trump\u2019s evident vices; that whatever explains their attachment to the president, it is not that they repudiate the values he does not respect. Our tribal prejudices are at their worst in moments like these. Let\u2019s hope we can recover some measure of equilibrium and move, however stumblingly, toward a modus vivendi that entails working to see the best in one another and not just the worst. Only if we learn to overcome our fiercest prejudices can we take up the business of steering the ship of state as a people united despite our disagreements. I am applying to medical school, and on certain applications there is a question asking applicants to describe whether they identify as part of certain minority communities, including the L.G.B.T.Q. community. I have always publicly identified as heterosexual, yet I have bisexual tendencies that I\u2019ve never acted on or told anyone about. But I know that identifying myself as bisexual will diversify me as an applicant and perhaps increase my chances of acceptance. Does privately questioning my own sexuality qualify me as part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community? Or must I be out as bisexual in order to put it down on my application? Would I be taking away opportunities from students whose L.G.B.T.Q. status is more central to their identities? Name Withheld The Association of American Medical Colleges, which has worked with its member medical schools to design the application form they use, speaks of the importance of securing access to underrepresented minorities and specifies that \u201cunderrepresented in medicine means those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population.\u201d I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll get a bump up for being bisexual, notionally or actually. Still, because this question evidently invites personal comments, you can, if you wish, explain your situation just as you have here and let the institution decide. I work as the executive director of a nonprofit organization. Like so many, we are struggling through the pandemic with fewer resources, fewer staff members and even less certainty about the future. In the spring, I implemented belt-tightening with all our staff members, beginning with my own salary. I\u2019ve taken a sizable cut because of base-salary reduction and a partial furlough. Recently, a board member and his wife dropped by my office with a beautiful flower arrangement with an envelope attached, containing a wonderful note of encouragement and several thousand dollars in cash. This board member does not have a conflict of interest, is not expecting a better board position \u2014 no ulterior motive. They\u2019re well off and wanted to recognize my work. But my conscience is on high alert. A gift only for me when everyone here is working hard and is paid less than me to begin with? I feel conflicted about the gift and am strongly considering donating it to the organization.  At the same time, I want to honor the intentions behind this very kind gesture. Our organization does not have a policy against receiving gifts, and the money would be a help to me and my family. Please help me sort through what to do. Name Withheld A gift of this sort can result in your having a changed relationship with this donor and trustee; it is now, in a very personal way, a relationship between benefactor and beneficiary. Your donors\u2019 gifts contribute to your salary already, of course, but that\u2019s mediated by the formal structures of the institution and the law. A direct gift of this kind has a different meaning. It was doubtless meant to convey gratitude and respect, but it\u2019s also, at least potentially, a way of turning you into a personal prot\u00e9g\u00e9. So you need to think about what accepting the gift means for your future interactions with this person. Assuming you\u2019re OK with a somewhat changed relationship, you\u2019re still left to contend with the issue you raise about equity. Is it fair that this gift goes to you and not to other staff members who could use it even more? Because board members typically have personal relationships only with senior management, they are not likely to have the kinds of bonds with the rest of the staff that lead to this kind of generosity. The truth is that philanthropic gifts generally aren\u2019t based on need; there\u2019s almost always a more deserving recipient. The money you give to the local art museum is money that could vaccinate children and save lives in a poor country far away. Whatever the case is for giving money to the museum in those circumstances, it can\u2019t be that the museum has the greater need. That philanthropy is mostly not guided by a pure calculus of utility is one reason for having a public system to address the basic needs of all citizens. Still, a gift is a gift, and \u2014 if you choose to accept it \u2014 you are free to do with it what you will. Your scruples suggest that spending the money on your own family may not reflect your moral priorities. So, knowing the challenges facing your less well-off employees, you could, as you say, use the money to help the organization. Because your gift will be tax-deductible, it\u2019s possible that some part of the money may, in fact, end up in your pocket.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump Was My Fitspo My birthday fell on Election Day 2016. The giant carrot cake sat uncut at our watch party as we saw Ohio flash red. Then Florida. Sometime around North Carolina, my friends started mumbling the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song. I blew out the candles, knowing the electoral map would deny me my wish. For days after, I could not get Donald Trump out of my mind. It was not a matter of party politics; it was that this future president had run on a platform that seemed opposed to the very idea of me: a woman, a person of color, a child of immigrants. I was stressed, distressed \u2014 angry. Then I started thinking about all my annoyingly upbeat runner friends who over the years professed that what they loved most about the sport was how it just \u201cclears your head.\u201d I\u2019d never really understood it. My whole life I\u2019d scoffed at vigorous exercise. At the school I attended, varsity letters were handed out for Model United Nations as often as they were for sports (I went the nerdier route). My mother still calls sneakers \u201cP.E. shoes\u201d because she purchased them only for our middle school physical education classes. Thanks to her, I had a decent metabolism and a great ineptitude for anything remotely athletic. The Monday after Donald Trump\u2019s election, that changed. With few other options to escape my own mind, I put on a pair of P.E. shoes I\u2019d bought two years earlier, which were still good as new. And I entered the \u201cred room\u201d \u2014 a boutique fitness arena otherwise known as Barry\u2019s Bootcamp. It was like nothing I\u2019d ever seen: nightclub lighting, blaring music, treadmills and a terrifying wall of dumbbells the size of my head. The class was full of people who looked like athletes or models or both, contorting their bodies into positions named after sharp objects like \u201cjackknives.\u201d On Tread No. 18, facing a mirrored wall, I sprinted toward an aspirational reflection of myself: determined, radiant with sweat, and no longer moping on my couch. I was propelled by pop hits remixed at 135 beats per minute and the chants of a muscular preacher stationed at Floor Bench No. 9. Apparently, I could \u201cdo anything for 30 seconds.\u201d The coach continued to preach, \u201cWe all have the power to leave behind whatever it is that holds us back!\u201d I believed him. I panted harder and found a second wind in my quest to leave behind Donald Trump. For that one hour \u2014 for the first time in 5 days 22 hours and 21 minutes \u2014 I was free of him. It was the beginning of a bizarre transformation inspired by a septuagenarian president whose preferred workout is typing on Twitter, playing a round of golf and raising the remote to summon his own image on the TV screen. Not your standard Instagram #fitspo. The red room at Barry\u2019s became my church. I started going every week, then every other day, and sometimes more. Eventually I added other fitness classes to the rotation: Megaformer Pilates; a circuit session where we pushed and pulled sleds like Rocky Balboa; and even a workout in which we wore high-tech skin suits designed to stimulate muscle groups with electrical pulses as we squatted and lunged around a studio in TriBeCa. When fitness classes shut down in the pandemic, I bought myself resistance bands and a mini-trampoline. I bounced through \u201crebounder\u201d cardio at home while cursing the president\u2019s lies about the coronavirus and the damage he was allowing to unfold in our nation. Exercise took the sadness and anger and powerlessness I felt about these four years and fueled it into something productive. It made me healthier than I\u2019d ever been. In the process, I realized I could change something: myself. So I started changing other things too. I volunteered more, I focused on producing film and TV projects that had some social purpose, and eventually I started to work at The Times. This president unintentionally changed many of us. Maybe you, like me, were one of the millions of voters who had skipped midterm elections but turned out in 2018. Maybe you, moved by his unapologetic abuse of women, finally came forward with a story from your past and said \u201cme too.\u201d Maybe he convinced you, Republican or Democrat, to run for office. To be a better dad. To fact-check your opinions. To subscribe to a newspaper. Or even to learn about Maricopa County, Arizona. Of course, civic engagement and sweating it out at the gym are not the same things. But they are connected. When we felt powerless to change the course of events unfolding in our nation\u2019s capital, we could at least control how we spend our own lives. I\u2019m sure many of us would give anything to erase his reign (I\u2019d certainly give up all the burpees, push-ups and that one time I embarrassingly fell on the treadmill going 11 miles per hour). Yet any bright spots we\u2019ve found during his presidency continue to glow. I wonder what will happen once he\u2019s gone. Will all that angry motivation melt away, leaving us complacent? Will it persist because even after four years of Donald Trump\u2019s supposed leadership, this election was tighter than we\u2019d expected? Or will the action and activism he unintentionally pushed us toward simply hang around like good habits? When it comes to my own workout routine, I think I\u2019ll keep it going. This time not for Donald Trump, but for myself. It turns out that my annoying runner friends were onto something. Exercise gave me a clarity of mind and purpose. It made me realize that in all that despair, I could find the strength to do things that once felt impossible. Not just for 30 seconds, but for four years. Maybe even for a lifetime.

    "article_text": "Scott Atlas, a Trump Coronavirus Adviser, Resigns WASHINGTON \u2014 Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused controversial theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, resigned his White House position on Monday. The move was not entirely unexpected. Dr. Atlas joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term after he caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with his frequent appearances on Fox News over the summer. Dr. Atlas\u2019s term was set to expire this week. \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus \u2014 to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Atlas wrote in a letter that he posted Monday night on Twitter, adding, \u201cI always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d Fox News earlier reported his resignation. Honored to have served @realDonaldTrump and the American people during these difficult times. pic.twitter.com/xT1hRoYBMh But some of Dr. Atlas\u2019s Trump administration colleagues would most likely contradict that assessment, citing views starkly different from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by other government scientists. Dr. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot spread the coronavirus. Even more contentious was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Dr. Atlas\u2019s view, the government\u2019s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as Covid-19 took its course. His argument was that most people infected with the coronavirus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people would have antibodies from Covid-19 to deprive the virus of carriers \u2014 so-called herd immunity. Dr. Atlas also railed against anything that smacked of a lockdown or business closure. \u201cProtect the high-risk; open schools, society,\u201d he tweeted in October. \u201cAlternative? Confine healthy people, restrict business, close schools\u2026kills people, destroys families, sacrifices kids. #RationalThinking.\u201d Public health experts were appalled and warned that his ideas were dangerous and would have disastrous results. But that did not stop Dr. Atlas. In mid-November, he called on people in Michigan to \u201crise up\u201d against coronavirus restrictions. The state\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who had faced death threats and a thwarted kidnapping attempt over the restrictions, denounced him as \u201cincredibly reckless.\u201d But in his resignation letter and the accompanying tweet, Dr. Atlas defended himself. \u201cWe also identified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd more and more,\u201d he added, \u201cthe relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged.\u201d Inside the administration, Dr. Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator. While Dr. Atlas was playing down the necessity of wearing masks, Dr. Birx was traveling the country preaching the opposite. She implored governors and public health officials in hard-hit states to take more aggressive steps. The two also clashed repeatedly in private. But Dr. Atlas\u2019s disagreements with Dr. Fauci were more visceral \u2014 and more public. After the election, Dr. Atlas accused Dr. Fauci of being a \u201cpolitical animal\u201d who changed his assessment of the threat of the pandemic after it became clear that Mr. Trump had lost. Dr. Fauci replied in kind. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes,\u201d he said recently on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, after Dr. Atlas\u2019s comments about Michigan. \u201cI just do, period.\u201d But Dr. Atlas had the ear of the one person who mattered: Mr. Trump. \u201cHe has many great ideas,\u201d the president told reporters in August at a White House briefing, with Dr. Atlas seated feet away. \u201cAnd he thinks what we\u2019ve done is really good, and now we\u2019ll take it to a new level.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump Raises $170 Million as He Denies His Loss and Eyes the Future President Trump has raised about $170 million since Election Day as his campaign operation has continued to aggressively solicit donations with hyped-up appeals that have funded his fruitless attempts to overturn the election and that have seeded his post-presidential political ambitions, according to a person familiar with the matter. The money, much of which was raised in the first week after the election, according to the person, has arrived as Mr. Trump has made false claims about fraud and sought to undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory. Instead of slowing down after the election, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has ratcheted up its volume of email solicitations for cash, telling supporters that money was needed for an \u201cElection Defense Fund.\u201d In reality, the fine print shows that the first 75 percent of every contribution currently goes to a new political action committee that Mr. Trump set up in mid-November, Save America, which can be used to fund his political activities going forward, including staff and travel. The other 25 percent of each donation is directed to the Republican National Committee. A donor has to give $5,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s new PAC before any funds go to his recount account. Still, the Trump campaign continues to urgently ask for cash. On Monday, Mr. Trump signed a campaign email that breathlessly told supporters that the end of November \u2014 nearly four weeks after Election Day \u2014 represented \u201cour most IMPORTANT deadline EVER.\u201d The Washington Post reported earlier on Monday that Mr. Trump\u2019s postelection efforts had raised more than $150 million. Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, declined to comment on the fund-raising. The $170 million figure, raised in less than four weeks, is an enormous sum that rivals the amounts of money brought in at the peak of the campaign. While a breakdown of the money was not immediately available, the deluge of donations would appear to have paid off any remaining Trump campaign debt (in the first days after the election, the fine print showed that contributions were earmarked for that purpose). The money is also likely to provide Mr. Trump with a sizable financial head start in paying for his post-presidency political activities. Despite the influx of cash, both the Trump campaign and the R.N.C. have reduced the size of their staffs since the election. In October, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began automatically checking a box on its website so that more donors would make additional, weekly donations from their accounts through Dec. 14 \u2014 the day the Electoral College will vote \u2014 to create a postelection revenue stream. Donors can opt out with an extra click, but critics called the tactic misleading. Mr. Trump\u2019s team created the political action committee, known as a leadership PAC, in part to capture the influx of postelection money, according to people familiar with the matter. Currently, donors on Mr. Trump\u2019s website are opted in with a prechecked box to make monthly contributions. Rob Flaherty, who served as Mr. Biden\u2019s digital director, said on Twitter that the huge sums raised by Mr. Trump since the election were \u201cplain and simple grift.\u201d On Monday, Arizona and Wisconsin, two key battlegrounds that Mr. Biden flipped this year, certified their election results, formalizing Mr. Biden\u2019s victory as Mr. Trump and his allies have continued to complain without evidence of fraud.",

Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home. #WHChristmas pic.twitter.com/fdZmB3rdXL The bold aesthetic choices that drew so much flak and snarky memes in Christmases past are noticeably absent. There are no blood-red trees, as there were in 2018, which various news outlets called \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cdeeply haunted.\u201d There is nothing akin to the icy, underlit branches of 2017 that turned the East Colonnade into what some likened to a barren, dystopian landscape. This year, a toy train \u2014 the \u201cWhite House Express\u201d \u2014 circles a wreath placed on a center table. Crafty ornaments bear the names of children from Maryland, Michigan and the Northern Mariana Islands. Other decorations celebrate \u201cpioneers for gender equality,\u201d as the first lady\u2019s office put it, including the artist Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. This is Mrs. Trump\u2019s last Christmas at the White House as first lady, and if her tree trimmings seem unimpeachable by design, that may be the point. She received an early lump of coal in her stocking in September, when her former adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff published a tell-all memoir, \u201cMelania and Me.\u201d Among the newsworthy comments Mrs. Trump made in the book \u2014 and in secretly recorded conversations Ms. Winston Wolkoff released \u2014 was her complaint about the chore of the holidays, and her negative press coverage compared to her predecessor, Michelle Obama. Mrs. Trump was heard on the recordings delivering a profanity-laced rant about \u201cChristmas stuff\u201d and decorations. \u201cBut I need to do it, right?\u201d she added. Mrs. Trump has also been tasked with spreading cheer at a time when daily deaths from Covid-19 are approaching tallies not seen since the spring and many Americans are canceling holiday plans out of fear of spreading the virus. Her decorations, including a snow-covered mini hospital and ornaments of a garbage truck, a nurse\u2019s hat and a lab coat, nod to the pandemic and essential workers. Early reviews of the decorations have been charitable. CNN highlighted a tree in the Vermeil Room with ornaments featuring a portrait of President John F. Kennedy and sailboats, and another tree in the library celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, noting, \u201cSignificant thought and detail went into the Americana decorations.\u201d The Independent wrote: \u201cMs. Trump and an army of volunteers put together a warmer, less edgy display that runs throughout the Executive Mansion.\u201d Even outlets that have been harshly critical of Mrs. Trump\u2019s take on the holidays couldn\u2019t work up the energy this year. Consider this tepid headline from Mashable: \u201cMelania Trump unveils her final White House Christmas decorations and they\u2019re fine.\u201d The website gave grudging respect to Mrs. Trump, and seemed almost disappointed not to carry on the recent holiday tradition, undertaken by much of the media, of skewering the White House Christmas design choices. \u201cPlaying it safe is probably a good strategy this year,\u201d the article said. \u201cThis theme is harder to meme, for sure.\u201d",

President Trump on Monday morning inaccurately described Georgia\u2019s vote counting process and implausibly urged the state\u2019s Republican governor to \u201coverrule\u201d its Republican secretary of state. Why won\u2019t Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a \u201cgoldmine\u201d of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.... The tweet was the latest of Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing assault on election results in Georgia and its top Republican officials, which has ignited an intraparty feud in the state. Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia does not have the authority to do what Mr. Trump is suggesting. Moreover, signature verification is already part of the vote counting process. When absentee ballots are received, Georgia\u2019s election officials verify the signature on the envelopes. The ballots and envelopes are then separated to protect privacy, so rechecking the envelopes during a recount would be meaningless. \u201cGeorgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections. The secretary of state, who is an elected constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The notion that \u201cthe governor has inherent executive authority to suspend or investigate or somehow interfere with this process \u2014 that\u2019s just not true,\u201d said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University. \u201cThere is no plausible case here whatsoever.\u201d Unlike the federal government, Georgia does not have a unitary executive and its governor and secretary of state have separate duties. Even the governor\u2019s emergency powers are limited. Mr. Kreis said that Georgia\u2019s code was \u201cvery clear\u201d on the kinds of things a governor can do in a state of emergency. Mr. Kemp can move resources and funds and enact temporary measures, Mr. Kreis said, but \u201che does not have the authority to expressly interfere with elections.\u201d Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, continued to push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s and his allies\u2019 baseless claims of mass voter fraud in a news conference on Monday. \u201cThe truth matters, especially around election administration,\u201d Mr. Raffensperger said. \u201cThere are those who exploit the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and frankly, they\u2019re misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d",

    "h1": "A Census Case That Goes to the Heart of American Democracy",
    "first_p": "On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states?",
    "article_text": "A Census Case That Goes to the Heart of American Democracy On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states? For more than two centuries, the answer has been \u201cyes.\u201d Both Article 1 of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment require that House seats be allotted according to \u201cthe whole number\u201d of persons in each state. That phrase has long been read to include all the nation\u2019s residents, whether American citizens, foreigners admitted here on visas or immigrants with no documents at all. But President Trump signaled in a memorandum this summer that he intended to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the 2020 census totals that he hoped to send to the House next year for use in reapportionment. Federal courts have ruled in three separate lawsuits that Mr. Trump lacks that authority, saying in one case that the question was not even close. But the Supreme Court will have the final say. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the basics behind the issue: First and foremost, the allocation of political power. No precise count of unauthorized immigrants exists. Mr. Trump has ordered the Census Bureau to come up with an estimate, but many experts put the number at about 11 million. Many are concentrated in states with large immigrant populations, such as New York and Texas, and in states like California and Florida where undocumented immigrants also are in demand for farm work. Some of those states and a few others could lose House seats if unauthorized immigrants were excluded from census totals. Conversely, some states with few unauthorized immigrants could pick up those seats. Alabama, for example, appears set to lose one of its seven House seats in the next reapportionment; the state is arguing in a separate lawsuit that undocumented immigrants are illegally depriving its citizens of fair representation. Many experts feel that restricting the count to citizens would tend to benefit states that are rural and Republican at the expense of ones that are urban and Democratic. But the Republican Party\u2019s gains probably would be small, most say, given that big Republican states like Texas would be among those that could be affected by the change. The Justice Department argues that federal law gives the president discretion to make policy judgments about whom the census counts. That discretion includes setting the definition of an \u201cinhabitant\u201d or \u201cusual resident\u201d of the United States, two terms that have historically been used to describe people who qualify to be counted in a census. The president\u2019s lawyers say federal law gives \u201cvirtually unfettered discretion\u201d to the Commerce Department \u2014 the federal agency that oversees the Census Bureau \u2014 to decide what data is used in counting individual residents of states. Opponents of the president\u2019s plan say 230 years of history are on their side. Noncitizens have been counted in every census \u2014 and used in every reapportionment of the House \u2014 since the very first census was conducted in 1790. In the nation\u2019s early history, a substantial share of the population had migrated from other countries, and for many decades thereafter, some states actively recruited foreigners to provide labor and boost political representation. The framers of the Constitution elected to exclude some people from being counted \u2014 specifying \u201cIndians not taxed\u201d and, most notoriously, deciding to count someone who was enslaved as three-fifths of a person \u2014 but left noncitizens intact. The drafters of the 14th Amendment debated whether to count all immigrants for apportionment purposes, and elected in the end to do so. The opponents also say that the Constitution explicitly requires that the decennial census be used for reapportionment, and that Mr. Trump has no authority to deduct unauthorized immigrants from that census before sending population totals to the House. Three courts \u2014 in New York, Maryland and California \u2014 have ruled against the White House on varying grounds and in some cases barred the Commerce Department from sending a count of unauthorized immigrants to the White House. The California court ruled that excluding noncitizens violated both federal law and the Constitution. In New York, a panel of three judges, two appointed by President George W. Bush and one by President Barack Obama, said unanimously that \u201cthe merits of the parties\u2019 dispute are not particularly close or complicated.\u201d The panel said federal law required the government to produce a single set of population figures for reapportionment, making Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a separate estimate of unauthorized immigrants moot. The judges also said that \u201cso long as they reside in the United States, illegal aliens qualify as \u2018persons\u2019 in a \u2018state\u2019 as Congress used those words.\u201d Because of that, the judges said, there was no need to take up the question of whether the president\u2019s plan also violated the Constitution. It would be extremely hard, if only because many of them are trying their best to avoid being seen for fear of deportation. The Trump administration had ordered the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census in an attempt to come up with a tally, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the Commerce Department had failed to offer a plausible explanation of why the question was needed. On the president\u2019s order, a Census Bureau task force is working to provide a count anyway, mostly by sifting through federal and state records that show conclusively who is a citizen \u2014 and by implication, who is not. A handful of records, such as compilations of people marked for deportation, do identify people who are in the county illegally, but those tallies are a small fraction of the entire population of unauthorized immigrants. It appears unlikely that the bureau will produce an estimate of unauthorized immigrants by the Dec. 31 statutory deadline for sending population totals to the White House. Indeed, Census Bureau officials told the Commerce Department this month that the 2020 census itself could not be completed until after Mr. Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. The bureau\u2019s experts nevertheless are racing to complete a count of unauthorized immigrants for delivery to Mr. Trump in early or mid-January.",

    "h1": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration",
    "first_p": "Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there. ",
    "article_text": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there.  The case is Batalla Vidal v. Wolf. Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who handed down the order, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must \u201cpost a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order ... that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA\u201d because the department\u2019s ostensible leader tried to limit the DACA program without having the authority to do so. The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to end the program. In 2017, Trump\u2019s DHS issued a memo that sought to wind down the DACA program, but the Supreme Court ruled last June that DHS\u2019s initial attempts to end it were void because the department did not adequately explain why it was doing so. Rather than fully reinstating DACA following the Supreme Court\u2019s order, however, DHS issued a new memo in July signed by Undersecretary of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Strategy, Policy, and Plans Chad Wolf \u2014 and the lawfulness of this July memo was the central issue in Batalla Vidal. \u201cI have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,\u201d Wolf wrote in that memo.  The memo directs \u201cDHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to reject all pending and future initial requests for DACA,\u201d and it provides that current DACA beneficiaries may only receive one-year renewals of their DACA status, rather than the two-year extensions they would have received prior to this memo. Wolf, moreover, purported to be far more than a mere undersecretary in his memorandum. In November of 2019, President Trump named Wolf acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and Wolf signed his July memo as \u201cActing Secretary.\u201d This distinction matters because as undersecretary, Wolf lacks the power to make changes to DACA, but the Secretary of Homeland Security does have the authority to make such changes. Judge Garaufis ruled in mid-November that Wolf \u201cwas not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Homeland Security Act (\u2018HSA\u2019) when he issued the July 28, 2020 memorandum,\u201d thereby cutting the legs out from under Wolf\u2019s attempt to water down the DACA program. If Wolf is not the acting secretary, then his July memo is void. The order Garaufis handed down on Friday lays out some of the consequences of the judge\u2019s mid-November decision. \u201cBecause Mr. Wolf was without lawful authority to serve as Acting Secretary of OHS, the Wolf Memorandum is VACATED,\u201d Garaufis wrote in his most recent order. So the good news for DACA-eligible immigrants is that, barring a decision from a higher court blocking Garaufis\u2019s most recent order, those immigrants will soon be able to obtain DACA status. And even if the order is blocked, President-elect Joe Biden has also pledged to fully reinstate DACA once he takes office on January 20. Nevertheless, the future of DACA remains uncertain. For one thing, the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision blocking the Trump administration\u2019s initial attempts to end the program was a  5-4 decision, with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the majority. Since then, Trump has replaced Ginsburg with the far more conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And even before Barrett arrived at the Supreme Court, several members of the Court had signaled that they thought DACA is illegal. So there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the Court\u2019s new 6-3 Republican majority will strike down the DACA program even as Biden tries to preserve it. The logic of Garaufis\u2019s November opinion \u2014 that presidents have only limited authority to make acting appointments \u2014 could also come back to bite Biden, especially if Republicans control the Senate and, with it, the power to block Biden\u2019s nominees. The core issue in the Batalla Vidal case turns on whether Wolf was lawfully appointed acting secretary, and therefore is empowered to make changes to the DACA program. Garaufis\u2019s opinion holding that Wolf was not lawfully appointed is fairly straightforward. The Homeland Security Act provides that, if DHS\u2019s top job becomes vacant, the deputy secretary shall act as secretary. If both jobs are vacant, then \u201cthe Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary.\u201d A sitting secretary, moreover, \u201cmay designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.\u201d Currently, DHS\u2019s top ranks are a bit a of ghost town. All three of the top jobs are vacant. Kirstjen Nielsen, the last person to serve as a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security, resigned in April of 2019. Before she left, however, she did lay out the order of succession that should apply if the top three jobs at DHS became vacant. If all top three jobs were vacant, Nielsen determined, then the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency should become secretary \u2014 but this job has been vacant since the spring of 2019. Next in line would be the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \u2014 a job that, until recently, was filled by Christopher Krebs.  Trump fired Krebs in mid-November after Krebs refuted false claims by Trump and some of Trump\u2019s allies that Biden somehow stole the 2020 election. But Krebs still was in his job as head of CISA in July, when Wolf handed down his DACA memo. That means that Krebs, not Wolf, should have been the acting secretary in July. It\u2019s worth noting that, even with Krebs out of the picture, Wolf still is not next in line to be acting secretary. After Krebs is the DHS\u2019s undersecretary for science and technology, but this position is vacant and the job is currently being done by a \u201cSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology.\u201d The next person in line after that is the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis, but that position is vacant as well, and the relevant office is held by an acting official. Eighth in line is the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, but that position is also vacant and there, too, the office is led by an acting official. Ninth in line is the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA actually does have a Senate-confirmed leader \u2014 David Pekoske was confirmed to lead the TSA in 2017 \u2014 and he still holds that office. So it would appear that Pekoske, not Wolf, should currently be serving as acting secretary of DHS. As this litany of vacant offices and acting officials suggests, the courts have thus far been fairly tolerant of President Trump\u2019s attempts to bypass the Senate and fill top jobs with acting officials. But Judge Garaufis\u2019s order suggests that tolerance may be coming to an end just as Biden is preparing to take office. We do not yet know who will control the Senate at the beginning of the Biden administration. Currently, Republicans hold a 50-48 seat majority in the incoming Senate, with two seats to be determined in a January 5 Georgia runoff election.  If Democrats win both of those seats, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote will give them a narrow majority in the Senate. But if Republicans prevail in either Georgia race, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will continue to lead the Senate, and Republicans will have the power to block any Biden nominee to any Senate-confirmed job. Biden, meanwhile, may find himself unable to staff his administration if Republicans choose to sabotage his presidency. While the Department of Homeland Security has a rigid order of succession for its top job, most agencies are governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act   (FVRA) when a Senate-confirmed position becomes vacant.  Under the FVRA, the president may temporarily fill a vacant, Senate-confirmed job with an acting appointee. But the president cannot fill the job with just anyone \u2014 typically the acting appointee must either be currently serving in a Senate-confirmed job, or be currently serving as a senior civil servant. Thus, if a vacancy arises in the middle of a presidency, that\u2019s typically no big deal. After the first year of a new presidency, the president will normally have appointed hundreds of individuals to Senate-confirmed jobs. So that gives the president a deep bench of officials to slide into acting roles as they are needed. But, at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, he won\u2019t be able to rely on existing Senate-confirmed officials to serve as acting secretaries if the Senate refuses to confirm his nominees. With rare exceptions, the only people in Senate-confirmed jobs when Biden takes office will be Trump appointees.  Biden could potentially fill the vacant jobs with civil servants \u2014 that is, with senior career officials in the relevant agencies \u2014 but that could prevent Biden from naming a Cabinet that shares his political and policy vision. The FVRA imposes rigid limits on just how long an individual may serve in an acting role. Under many circumstances, the tenure of an acting official is limited to just 210 days after a vacancy arises. So even though Biden could fill many jobs temporarily with civil servants, many of those acting appointments will expire just seven months into his presidency. As mentioned above, the courts haven\u2019t exactly been rigorous in enforcing these restrictions under President Trump, but they now seem likely to take a new interest in enforcing laws like the FVRA once Biden takes office. A 6-3 Republican Supreme Court is unlikely to bend the law in order to help a Democratic president \u2014 and really, the law is quite clear that Biden does not have a limitless power to make acting appointments. A tremendous amount, in other words, is potentially at stake in the Georgia Senate runoffs. Those races could determine whether the Biden administration is able to perform many of the most basic functions of government \u2014 starting with actually getting people into top jobs within the administration.",

    "first_p": "President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for the coronavirus.",
    "article_text": "Rudy Giuliani is the latest Trump associate to get the coronavirus President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Giuliani \u201chas tested positive for the China Virus,\u201d Trump tweeted, using the racist term he habitually uses for the coronavirus. \u201cGet better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\u201d Giuliani\u2019s positive test comes roughly two weeks after his son tested positive. It\u2019s unclear how and when Giuliani contracted the virus. Giuliani has been traveling constantly across the country in recent weeks, leading Trump\u2019s failing legal efforts to contest the results of the 2020 presidential election, and has been in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona \u2014 all states with high virus case numbers \u2014 in the past two weeks. He has been in contact with members of Trump\u2019s legal team in recent days, as well as witnesses incorrectly alleging voting improprieties, and Michigan lawmakers.  On Wednesday, he participated in testimony falsely claiming that votes were illegally cast in Michigan in an indoor, largely maskless session before Michigan\u2019s House Oversight Committee. Depending on when Giuliani was infected, those in attendance may be at risk of exposure. The president did not say on Sunday whether Giuliani is symptomatic, or if he plans to isolate to avoid infecting others with Covid-19. At 76 years old and male, he is in a group considered to be at greater risk for complications and more negative outcomes of the disease.  Giuliani is the latest of many figures and staffers in the president\u2019s orbit to contract the coronavirus, including Trump himself, much of the president\u2019s family, his chief of staff, multiple senior advisers, and the White House press secretary. All together, more than a dozen people in the president\u2019s personal orbit have tested positive since October. Some of this spread has been attributed to the fact that Trump\u2019s inner circle has routinely declined to wear masks and abide by social distancing protocols. For instance, the president has held a number of large, maskless indoor events \u2014 including a party celebrating Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. That party was labeled a superspreader event by top federal infectious disease expert and national coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci.  Giuliani has participated in a number of these sorts of high-risk events, from the hearing on Wednesday to a rally the former mayor held for Trump ahead of the election. Like many on the president\u2019s team, Giuliani has not shown strong support for precautions like mask-wearing; in October, Giuliani criticized President-elect Joe Biden for his mask-wearing habit and said that his use of them was meant to induce fear. \u201cIt isn\u2019t science to be wearing that mask, Joe, when you are giving a speech and people are 30-40 feet away from you,\u201d Giuliani said during an interview with Fox News. \u201cThe only thing you can infect is the teleprompter that\u2019s near you. So, I see through you. That\u2019s a political statement to scare people, wearing that mask. You do not need that mask when you are standing at a podium.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s Georgia rally was supposed to pump up Loeffler and Perdue. It ended up as a grievance fest. Outgoing President Donald Trump traveled to Valdosta, Georgia, on Saturday for a rally that was ostensibly meant to pump up voters and encourage them to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ahead of next month\u2019s runoff elections. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump ended up having a hard time talking about anything but himself and his grievances. Trump\u2019s trip to Georgia for his first post-election rally came as he continues to push lies about the election being stolen from him \u2014 and as he makes a last-ditch push for Republican-controlled legislatures to overturn the election results. Much of Trump\u2019s remarks consisted of variations on these themes, and his insistence that the election was rigged against him in states he lost, like Georgia, was at tension with the idea it\u2019s important for Republicans to turn out for Loeffler and Perdue.  That incoherency was evident throughout Trump\u2019s speech on Saturday, which began with him brazenly lying that he actually won Georgia. \u201cWe won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d Trump said, even though his loss in the state has already been certified by Georgia election officials. Trump ended up repeating this lie so many times throughout his speech that by the end of it he was mentioning it in passing as if it\u2019s settled fact. Despite his insistence that the Georgia Republicans who run the state at best looked the other way while Democrats conspired to steal the election from him, Trump at other points urged his fans to go out and vote for Loeffler and Perdue, saying things like, \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, the socialists and communists win.\u201d  But what the president didn\u2019t bother trying to explain is why Republican voters should have any confidence the runoffs won\u2019t be rigged just like he says the presidential election was, given that they will be run by the same officials. Both Georgia senators are in tight races, and the slim margin by which Trump lost the state would make it seem that even a slightly depressed turnout could cost Loeffler and Perdue their seats come January. And should they both lose, Democrats will regain control of the Senate thanks to the tiebreaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Republicans were counting on the president to help provide both candidates with some momentum. But the downside of Trump\u2019s difficulty talking about anything other than himself or the alleged terribleness of other people became evident when Loeffler and Perdue took the stage to tepid applause. Their brief remarks were truncated by \u201cfight for Trump!\u201d chants that drowned them out. The Georgia rally came hours after Trump reportedly phoned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and asked him to convene a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Kemp reportedly turned Trump down, and perhaps as a result, Trump attacked him a number of times throughout his speech, at one point telling his fans, \u201cYour governor should be ashamed of himself.\u201d Then, toward the end of the rally, Trump outlined the desperate two-front battle he\u2019s trying to fight to overturn the election, saying, \u201chopefully our legislatures and the United States Supreme Court will step forward and save our country.\u201d But since neither Republican-controlled state legislatures or the Supreme Court have thus far shown much inclination to get involved in an election President-elect Joe Biden clearly won, Trump appears to have a backup plan \u2014 one he expressed in a fittingly incoherent manner. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win back the White House. We\u2019re gonna win it back,\u201d Trump said, teasing a 2024 run, but he then immediately added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until 2024. I want to go back three weeks.\u201d Unfortunately for Trump, there\u2019s no do-overs. But in the meantime, his refusal to concede has led to a fundraising bonanza that could end up helping him launch a bid to avenge his loss to Biden, based on the \u201cthey stole it from me\u201d lies he\u2019s been pushing over the month since Election Day.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops from Somalia, briefly explained The Trump administration will pull virtually all of the US\u2019s roughly 700 troops in Somalia out of the country just five days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. The withdrawal, announced Friday by the Pentagon, ostensibly marks the latest attempt by President Donald Trump to scale back US presence overseas in what he\u2019s described as costly and ineffective military operations across regions like the Middle East. Acting defense secretary Christopher Miller announced in November that the US plans to reduce US troops from 4,500 to 2,500 in Afghanistan and from 3,000 to 2,500 in Iraq. But the strategy shift in Somalia appears to be something different.  Rather than a case of troops being brought home, many of the forces will be repositioned to neighboring Kenya, according to a Defense Department official, although it\u2019s unclear so far what percentage of the Somali-based troops will be restationed there.  \u201cAs a result of this decision, some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement on Friday. \u201cHowever, the remaining forces will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both US and partner forces.\u201d The US forces stationed in Somalia were largely tasked with counterterrorism missions, with a particular focus on fighting the presence of al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militant group. And US troops have also worked on training Somali forces to conduct raids and capture al-Shabaab leaders. According to the Pentagon, the mission against al-Shabaab won\u2019t end \u2014 instead, the troops once stationed in the country will \u201cmaintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia\u201d from bases in Kenya and elsewhere. The Pentagon also said the military will \u201cretain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia, and collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the homeland.\u201d How successful the US has been in Somalia at this mission isn\u2019t exactly clear. And the US\u2019s methods for accomplishing its work against al-Shabaab have been met with sharp criticism from watchdogs, who argue counterterrorism operations in East Africa have been conducted without a proper level of accountability. One of the US\u2019s primary tools against al-Shabaab has been drone strikes, which it has been conducting in Somalia since 2007. The frequency of those strikes have increased significantly during the Trump administration, with 47 strikes carried out in 2018 and 63 in 2019, according to the New York Times. All told, the Trump administration has carried out at least 192 drone strikes in Somalia, an analysis by New America found. Under Trump\u2019s tenure, the oversight guidelines for strikes in Somalia, some of which are meant to minimize civilian casualties, have also been loosened.  In the first seven months of the Trump administration, Trump oversaw more drone strikes than took place under George W. Bush and Barack Obama combined, and human rights groups have accused US officials of acknowledging a fraction of the known civilian casualties from those strikes. Amnesty International has accused the administration of passing off civilian killings as successful al-Shabaab raids, and of refusing to offer compensation when innocent people are accidentally killed. Al-Shabaab appears to be resilient in the face of US intervention. A Defense Department inspector general report this year found that Somalia\u2019s security forces appear to still be overwhelmed by the militant group.  \u201cDespite many years of sustained Somali, U.S., and international counterterrorism pressure, the terrorist threat in East Africa is not degraded: al-Shabaab retains freedom of movement in many parts of southern Somalia and has demonstrated an ability and intent to attack outside of the country, including targeting U.S. interests,\u201d the report states. And that ability has been on display of late. Recently, a CIA contractor was killed in action in Somalia, and al-Shabaab staged a January attack on a US facility in Kenya that resulted in the death of a US solider, two contractors, and the destruction of expensive military equipment \u2014 including a US surveillance craft. Particularly in light of the January attack, US military officials in East Africa reportedly began to push for greater flexibility to launch airstrikes from Kenya, and Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta also reportedly asked Trump for greater aid with countering al-Shabaab earlier this year. The troop redeployment would appear to accomplish both these aims. And indeed, while US training of Somali security forces is expected to end, airstrikes against militants in Somalia will be continuing, since the air bases housing the US drones that carry out strikes in Somalia are currently based outside the country.

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s legal team advances yet another far-fetched lawsuit in Georgia President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed yet another lawsuit contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, this time calling for a complete do-over of the election in Georgia. That\u2019s despite two recounts in the state \u2014 overseen by Republican officials \u2014 both indicating Biden\u2019s victory in the state is unambiguous and not going to change. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit, filed in a Georgia state court on Friday, represents the latest of dozens of efforts by his campaign and its allies to contest the legitimacy of vote counts in key states across the nation, all of which have failed to gain traction \u2014 or even be taken seriously by judges \u2014 with the exception of one minor win involving an insignificant number of ballots. But while Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud have no chance at overturning the results of the presidential election, according to legal experts, they continue to shape Republicans\u2019 widespread reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration, potentially setting the stage for even higher levels of polarization in Washington than before.       According to ABC News, Trump\u2019s latest Georgia lawsuit alleges that the state\u2019s election code was \u201cdisregarded, abandoned, ignored, altered, and otherwise violated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca sufficient number of illegal votes\u201d being included in the count. The lawsuit takes issue with rule changes regarding the eligibility of ballots, and includes allegations of fraud \u201cbased on witness affidavits, but with little evidence,\u201d ABC\u2019s Olivia Rubin and Matthew Mosk report. Trump\u2019s team is using these claims to call for \u201ca new Presidential Election to occur at the earliest opportune time.\u201d Georgia is in the midst of its third tally of votes overseen by Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Biden\u2019s margin of victory, while narrow, appears firm. Georgia\u2019s unprecedented hand-count audit confirmed Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, modestly reducing his margin of victory from 13,558 votes to 12,284 votes. And on Friday, preliminary results of a machine recount of the votes indicated that Biden is on track for a similar margin of victory on the third count of the ballots. The day that Trump\u2019s team filed the Georgia lawsuit, they also suffered two more legal defeats. In Nevada, a district judge denied a lawsuit from the Trump campaign contesting the state\u2019s results based on allegations of malfeasance. The judge said the legal team \u201cfailed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence.\u201d And the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear Trump\u2019s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss. Trump and his allies have filed at least 46 lawsuits across the country and their efforts have gone poorly, with even conservative and Trump-appointed judges writing scathing rejections of lawsuits bereft of credible evidence of election official misconduct, incompetence, or fraud. Earlier this week, Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop summarized the state of Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d politicking: \u201cThe lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors.\u201d Trump has called on those state legislative leaders to aid him in stealing the election by appointing electors to the Electoral College who are willing to ignore the results of the election in their states and cast their votes for him rather than for Biden.  As Prokop has explained, this scheme would be difficult to pull off in states in which the GOP isn\u2019t in control of the legislature, courts, and governorship \u2014 and is also one that has been routinely rejected by Republican lawmakers in swing states like Michigan. Only in Pennsylvania have GOP lawmakers endorsed such a plan, and there, their plans appear set to be foiled by the state\u2019s Democratic House and governor. This leaves lawsuits as the president\u2019s only remaining avenue for overturning the election\u2019s results. But these lawsuits have become so transparently filed in bad faith that state and local officials are beginning to call for judges to sanction Trump campaign and Republican lawyers.  Legal experts aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that judges could use financial penalties to deter future lawsuits, since Trump\u2019s legal efforts in many states have involve repeatedly bringing recycled, discredited claims and affidavits to court, a practice that could be deemed abusive. \u201cYou could see a court saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Daniel Weiner, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center election reform program, told ABC News. Despite Biden\u2019s decisive victory in the Electoral College, and the dozens of lawsuits failing to gain any traction, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Washington have declined to question their legitimacy or acknowledge Biden\u2019s status as incoming president.  This week, the Washington Post surveyed every Republican in Congress, and found that fewer than 30 were willing to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. Meanwhile more than 200 Republican members of the House and Senate would \u201csimply not say who won the election.\u201d Trump responded to the results of the Post\u2019s survey with anger, and suggested he wanted to retaliate against the small minority of Republicans who acknowledged he lost the election. \u201cI am surprised there are so many,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS.\u201d RINO is an acronym which stands for \u201cRepublican in name only,\u201d typically used on the right to criticize a Republican for being insufficiently conservative. Trump\u2019s extended legal battles, combined with his weeks-long insistence on Twitter and other platforms that the election was rigged, have also had a strong effect on public opinion.  For example, a mid-November Economist/YouGov poll found that 89 percent of Trump voters believe that voter fraud affected the election outcome, and a majority think it changed the outcome.  While Trump\u2019s legal fights have surfaced no evidence of widespread fraud or misconduct, they have successfully lent credibility to his campaign to convince large swaths of the public that the election was stolen. And that might be their most important legacy.         ",

    "h1": "The Trump-backed opposition leader in Venezuela is likely to lose his power",
    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The Trump-backed opposition leader in Venezuela is likely to lose his power  The Venezuelan politician President Donald Trump backed to depose and replace that country\u2019s dictator is poised to lose his position of power \u2014 making it harder for him to make his leadership claim and driving a stake into the heart of one of the Trump administration\u2019s signature foreign policies.  In January 2019, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the country\u2019s rightful president. He argued that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has been in power for seven years, rigged the 2018 presidential election that kept him in charge and that, as a result, Guaid\u00f3, as the head of the National Assembly, was the rightful interim president of the country according to the country\u2019s constitution. The United States and more than 50 other countries backed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim and have been working ever since to help him push Maduro out once and for all. They\u2019ve sanctioned politicians and businesses, sent much-needed food and medical aid, and helped sustain a global campaign to back Guaid\u00f3 and boost his popularity. But despite the two-year push, Guaid\u00f3 has remained in the National Assembly and Maduro in the president\u2019s mansion. Come Sunday, though, only Maduro likely will get to stay where he is. Venezuelans will head to the polls Sunday to vote in the country\u2019s National Assembly elections, where they\u2019ll determine the 277 people to represent them starting on January 5.  But Guaid\u00f3 and his opposition faction are boycotting the polls because they say the election is rigged.  They have a strong argument, especially since international observers from the European Union and the United Nations won\u2019t be watching. Plus, government security forces have blocked the opposition from entering the Legislative Palace to participate in National Assembly sessions since January \u2014 right when the body was set to reelect Guaid\u00f3 as its leader. Since then, Guaid\u00f3 and his allies have held their own parallel sessions of parliament outside of the institution. Even if they\u2019re in the right \u2014 and polls indicate many Venezuelans agree with their claims \u2014 it still means Guaid\u00f3 and his faction will likely lose their seats in the next National Assembly. That would deal the opposition a huge blow and deliver Maduro a significant victory. \u201cThe future of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s project looks grim,\u201d said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America human rights group. \u201cThere is less international consensus on the status of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the interim presidency after January 5.\u201d \u201cIt is likely that he will retain support but it will be less robust, and the whole Venezuela issue will be put on the back burner in the US and the EU,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe next two months will likely see a worsening of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s position that will lead to a slow degradation of his power and a slow consolidation for Maduro during 2021.\u201d Sunday\u2019s likely rigged election will represent an immense loss for what remains of Venezuela\u2019s democracy and effectively complete Maduro\u2019s authoritarian takeover of the economically devastated nation.  The National Assembly\u2019s December 2015 vote was seen as the country\u2019s last legitimate election. Since then, Maduro has put more and more of the nation\u2019s government under his boot, and he\u2019s now on the verge of claiming his final prize. With Venezuela\u2019s legislative body filled with the dictator\u2019s cronies, Maduro will have subverted the entire government to his will. Guaid\u00f3 will still have some ability to fight back. President-elect Joe Biden and leaders in other countries have vowed to support his cause, and he controls a large segment of the country\u2019s financial assets, including the Venezuelan Central Bank\u2019s accounts in the US, the oil company Citgo, and gold in the Bank of England.  The problem, experts say, is that this influence is more external than internal. Once he\u2019s officially out of the National Assembly, Guaid\u00f3 and his allies won\u2019t be able to stop contracts and agreements Maduro wants to sign with world powers like China and Russia for resource extraction or laws Maduro wants to pass that could curtail civil society and pro-democracy groups, experts say.  Maduro, then, found a way to ensure his reign over the last few years. And after Sunday, his seat on the throne almost surely will be secured.  ",

    "article_text": "A new Georgia poll suggests that Republican lies about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d are hurting the GOP Let\u2019s start this piece with some appropriate caveats about polling in general. 2020 was not a great year for the polling industry. Many polls, especially in Midwestern states and in Maine, vastly overestimated Democratic performance. The polls predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidential race, and he did, but he had comfortable polling leads in several states that turned out to be much closer. That said, pollsters in Georgia did a pretty good job with the presidential and Senate races. The FiveThirtyEight polling average predicted that Biden would win the state by 1.2 points. He wound up winning by 0.2 points. So the polls were only off by 1 percentage point, and close in the initial Senate races, too. That suggests that Georgia polling is more reliable than the polls in many other states. Which brings us to a new SurveyUSA poll looking at the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide which party controls the United States Senate (SurveyUSA is an \u201cA\u201d rated pollster, according to FiveThirtyEight). The topline in this poll is that Democrat Raphael Warnock leads appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a 52-45 margin. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue by a smaller 50-48 margin.  This poll is just one snapshot of the race. But if Democrats do win both seats, the incoming Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which means that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer would be majority leader (though Republicans would likely still be able to filibuster most legislation). One interesting thing about the SurveyUSA poll is that it offers a window into whether Republican turnout is likely to drop because of efforts by President Trump and his allies to diminish confidence in US elections. Briefly, the poll suggests that a small but significant number of Georgia Republicans do plan to sit out the election due to those efforts \u2014 enough to potentially flip these races to Warnock and Ossoff. Even before many outlets had called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump and his allies started touting evidence-free claims that Trump only lost because of widespread voter fraud. Trump campaign lawyers and lawyers aligned with the campaign also filed a series of meritless lawsuits challenging the election results or seeking to prevent states from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. These lawsuits have accomplished little, if anything. Trump has also attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both of whom are Republicans, for supposedly enabling voter fraud in that state. Again, there is no evidence that such fraud exists. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have even gone so far as to urge Republicans to boycott the Georgia runoff elections. At a rally in Atlanta this week, for example, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell said that she \u201cwould encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure.\u201d These attempts to undermine confidence in the Georgia runoff elections appear to be having an effect. The SurveyUSA poll interviewed a total of 717 registered voters, 118 of whom said they are not likely to vote in the runoff. Of these likely non-voters, 13 percent said they planned not to vote because \u201cthe voting process is rigged.\u201d Another 5 percent said they are \u201cintentionally boycotting the runoff.\u201d To be clear, 118 respondents is a very small sample size, so no one should take these figures as gospel. But there\u2019s other evidence that Republicans are more likely to sit out the January 5 runoffs than Democrats. As data journalist Nate Silver notes, the poll suggests that the January electorate could be 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the voters who turned out in November. In other words, if Warnock and Ossoff do prevail next month, they could have Trump and Trump allies like Sidney Powell to thank for their victory. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the election are likely to be ignored by Democrats, but they appear to be resonating with at least some Republicans.  And in two close elections, if even a small fraction of Republicans decide that their votes won\u2019t matter, that could swing both races to Democrats.",

    "article_text": "Federal watchdog says \u201csubstantial likelihood of wrongdoing\u201d at US broadcasting agency In June, a Steve Bannon ally and conservative filmmaker appointed by President Donald Trump took over running the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), a vast international network of news agencies funded and operated by the US government. Within hours of introducing himself to employees, the new CEO, Michael Pack, purged four top officials. He then went on to ban visas for certain foreign reporters and began investigating journalists at the agency for suspected anti-Trump bias. In October, he announced he was eliminating the agency\u2019s regulatory \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2014 longstanding internal policies aimed at protecting the editorial independence of journalists at the agency from political interference from the government. Critics accused Pack of abusing his power to turn America\u2019s state-run news organizations, whose mission is to disseminate factual, unbiased news to people who live in countries where freedom of the press is either strongly curtailed or nonexistent, into Trump-friendly propaganda outlets. While Pack and his team haven\u2019t achieved a pro-Trump project, a federal watchdog has found accusations of gross mismanagement to be credible. In letters to 11 whistleblowers on Wednesday night, the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2014 an investigative and prosecutorial government body \u2014 revealed that it had found \u201ca substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\u201d at the USAGM, which oversees four media organizations: Voice of America, Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. With help from the Government Accountability Project (GAP), which represents more than 20 current and former staffers at the USAGM, 11 whistleblowers sent specific complaints to the OSC over the last few months. They included allegations that USAGM leadership \u201crepeatedly violated the Voice of America (VOA) firewall\u201d and \u201cengaged in gross mismanagement and abuse of authority.\u201d Further, the whistleblowers claimed leadership \u201cpressured career staff to illegally repurpose \u2026 congressionally appropriated funds and programs without notifying Congress.\u201d On Wednesday evening, the OSC replied to these and other allegations, noting that what the whistleblowers alleged seemed to be true. \u201cOSC has found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing based on the information you submitted in support of your allegations,\u201d wrote Karen Tanenbaum, an attorney with OSC\u2019s  Retaliation and Disclosure Unit. However, OSC gives any offending agency \u2014 in this case, UASGM \u2014 60 days to conduct its own probe and respond to the complaints. It\u2019s not until that investigation ends that OSC makes a final determination. \u201cThis remains an open matter under investigation until the agency\u2019s final report is forwarded to the President and Congress,\u201d Tanenbaum concluded. Still, GAP senior counsel David Seide, who represents the whistleblowers, believes the letters signal an early victory for his clients. \u201cThe conduct by [USAGM] is shocking, and we\u2019re glad an independent agency agrees with us,\u201d Seide told me in an interview. It\u2019s unclear whether Pack and other agency leaders will face any real penalties while in office, though. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to fire Pack, and the 60 days that USAGM has to respond exceeds the remaining time until Biden\u2019s inauguration. It\u2019s therefore likely that Pack and his team will leave government before receiving any reprimands. But Seide and his clients feel this is more than just misbehavior on Pack\u2019s part. This is about protecting the culture of an agency with the tough task of reporting news independently and fiercely while on the federal payroll. \u201cThere\u2019s an accounting to be done here for lessons learned,\u201d said Seide. \u201cThis is very much a work in progress.\u201d What may come out of all this, then, is a bunch of congressional hearings on how best to oversee the USAGM and a tough Senate confirmation battle over who Biden selects to replace Pack. In the interim, the whistleblowers sense imminent victory. \u201cWe\u2019re all very encouraged by the OSC response and hope USAGM will take it seriously,\u201d a whistleblower, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for privacy reasons, told me.",

    "article_text": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s bizarre legal strategy, in two clips  \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do \u2014 take it and do something crazy to it?\u201d That\u2019s just one of many absurd claims in a clip that has reached more than 13 million views already, where Melissa Carone \u2014 one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s star witnesses at a hearing where he asked Michigan legislators to overturn the state\u2019s presidential election results \u2014 veers from accusation to accusation. In a testy exchange, Carone accuses Republican state representatives of tampering with state voting records when one official tells her the poll book is not off by 30,000 votes.  The exchange is comically hard to follow, but it\u2019s illustrative of the sputtering, slapdash, and conspiracy theory-driven nature of Trumpworld\u2019s flailing attempts to discredit and overturn the results of the 2020 election. Carone\u2019s testimony was part of a hearing scheduled on December 1 when Michigan House Oversight Chair Matt Hall (R) invited Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to \u201cspeak to the committee on election irregularities in Michigan.\u201d Hall said in his statement that he was hoping for \u201cclarity and transparency.\u201d  That\u2019s not what Michigan got.  According to MLive, the Trump legal team mostly spent their time calling up Michigan Republicans to testify against the election process in Wayne County. Many of them rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct \u201cmade at a Senate Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday and in affidavits included in various legal challenges to the election results ... none of those challenges have been successful in court.\u201d This hearing came two days after Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that there was no proof that widespread voter fraud could have altered the result of the 2020 presidential election. Michigan Republicans did not allow testimony under oath, restricted Democrats from calling witnesses, and prohibited cross-examination, leading Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to call the hearings a \u201cstate sponsored disinformation campaign geared toward undermining our electoral system.\u201d Carone\u2019s testimony was, if not emblematic, at least fairly in step with the rest of the hearing. Her testimony went too far for even Giuliani, who at one point leaned over, seemingly to try to restrain his witness after she laughed derisively at a request to stop interrupting the official asking her to clarify her claims of fraud. It\u2019s unclear what Giuliani expected \u2014 Carone\u2019s accusations had been aired on Fox when she was interviewed on November 11. In the interview with Lou Dobbs, she insinuated that vans providing food to poll workers were in fact carrying illegitimate votes instead. Days later, a Wayne County judge stated that these allegations \u201csimply are not credible,\u201d according to reporting by the Washington Post.  Multiple witnesses focused their criticisms on Detroit, a city that is 79 percent Black and that Giuliani referred to as \u201ccorrupt,\u201d saying \u201cdon\u2019t scratch your head about what happens in Detroit. They steal elections in Detroit.\u201d  MLive reported that Detroit activists have been alarmed by the Trump campaign\u2019s claims of voter fraud in their city. Activist Branden Snyder told MLive that it \u201creeks of racism ... that Black folks and in a majority-Black city can\u2019t count their own votes.\u201d Nessel echoed these claims, saying \u201cthe themes we see, that persist here, are this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent, and Black people can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, one Michigan woman used racist language to argue in favor of instituting a voter ID requirement.  Accusations of voter fraud are inextricable from the long history of restricting the right of people of color to vote. A January brief published by the Brennan Center for Justice explains: Of course, Michigan does have a voter ID requirement. You have to present a valid form of identification or sign an affidavit. In the November 2016 election, only around 18,000 people opted to sign an affidavit instead of providing identification, according to Bridge Michigan, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news source. President-elect Joe Biden received over 150,000 more votes than Trump in the state.  One Republican official\u2019s reaction to the hearing pretty much sums it up \u2014 state Rep. Aaron Miller castigated Giuliani, telling the Detroit News: \u201cHe made wild and broad partisan insults for several minutes that had nothing to do with the election, and it was frankly unacceptable, shameful, and pathetic and distracts from any evidence that we might hear. I\u2019m utterly embarrassed.\u201d ",

    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained   When five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 1989, prominent businessman Donald Trump bought newspaper advertisements calling on New York state to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in the wake of the attack. Little did the country know, Trump\u2019s views on capital punishment then would inform his presidency decades later: In July, the Trump administration reinstated the death penalty at the federal level after a 17-year hiatus. The return of federal executions demonstrates an unprecedented and grim picture of Trump\u2019s legacy in contrast to previous administrations. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board described it as a \u201csickening spree of executions.\u201d To put it in perspective, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, in less than five months, eight people have already been put to death by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, with five more executions scheduled to happen before Trump leaves office.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding a death penalty is just historically abhorrent,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of Death Penalty Information Center, a bipartisan organization that does not take a position for or against the death penalty, but rather is critical of the way capital punishment is administered.  If the remaining executions in December are carried out \u2014 making a total of 10 for 2020 \u2014 it will mark more civilian executions in a single calendar year than any other presidency in the 20th and 21st centuries. \u201cNo one has conducted this number of federal civilian executions in this short period of time in American history,\u201d Dunham added. Of the five upcoming federal executions during the lame-duck period, four of them are Black men, while the fifth will be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. These federal executions come in concert with the rallying cry for racial justice and an overhaul of America\u2019s policing and criminal justice systems that has left a disproportionate number of Black people arrested, jailed, convicted, and dead. More than 44 percent of the remaining 54 people on federal death row are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, even though Black people make up only 13 percent of the US population.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having a record-high number of federal executions, at the same time that we\u2019re near a record low in state executions, in the middle of a pandemic, shows how much the Trump administration is either out of touch or that it cannot resist gratuitous acts of cruelty,\u201d Dunham said, adding that only seven state executions will occur this year \u2014 the lowest since states began carrying out executions in colonial times. \u201cNobody needs to carry out an execution during a pandemic.\u201d Just last week, the Justice Department also published a rule that would allow other methods for capital punishment, such as firing squads, lethal gas, and electrocutions; Attorney General Bill Barr is currently racing to finalize that rule. Trump\u2019s push for additional methods and a number of federal executions will be part of his presidential legacy and highlights a stark divide between the administration\u2019s actions and dwindling support for the death penalty among Americans. On November 19, Orlando Hall, a Black man sentenced to death for kidnapping, rape, and murder in 1994, became the eighth and latest inmate to be executed by the federal government since it reinstated federal executions this summer. He is also the first in more than a century to be put to death during a lame-duck period. Shortly before Hall was executed by lethal injection, the US Supreme Court had denied his request to stop the execution \u2014 with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the majority ruling.  While Hall is the second Black man to be executed out of the eight so far since July, the remaining men scheduled to be put to death are all Black. \u201cIn an apparent effort to forestall criticism that the federal executions were racist, the administration selected white prisoners first,\u201d Dunham said; the executions were reinstated as racial justice protests broke out across the country this summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about that, though, is that it still tells us a lot about whose lives matter because only one of the people executed so far was convicted for killing an African American.\u201d Brandon Bernard, convicted of kidnapping and murder, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on December 10. Bernard, who is also Black, was only 18 years old when he committed crimes that resulted in the deaths of a young white married couple in 1999. But five of the nine surviving jurors who supported the death penalty at the time now believe it is inappropriate. Even Angela Moore, the federal prosecutor who helped put Bernard on death row, wrote an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star making a case for why the federal government should let him live. \u201cI always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation\u2019s honor,\u201d Moore wrote.  During his time in prison, Bernard has been a model prisoner, mentoring at-risk youth. \u201cHaving learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?\u201d Moore wrote.  Alfred Bourgeois, a Black truck driver in Texas who was convicted of abusing and killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, is scheduled for execution the day after Bernard. Bourgeois\u2019s execution was originally scheduled for January 2020 but was halted by a federal judge who blocked the Trump administration\u2019s early moves to bring back the federal death penalty. Bourgeois\u2019s lawyers then argued to suspend his death sentence on the grounds that he\u2019s entitled to an intellectual disability evaluation under the Eighth Amendment.  The next two inmates on death row are scheduled for execution in 2021 just a few days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "The past 24 hours in Trump\u2019s legal issues and pardon news, explained President Donald Trump, over the last 24 hours, has made one thing abundantly clear: His final few weeks in office will not be lacking in the legal drama and corruption concerns that have pervaded his presidency. After having already pardoned his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trump has been discussing potential broad preemptive pardons for his children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka; his son-in-law Jared Kushner; and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, per reporting from ABC News and the New York Times. None of these people has been charged with any crime, so these pardons would have to entail sweeping assertions of impunity. Meanwhile, a newly released, heavily redacted court opinion revealed that federal investigators have been probing an alleged corrupt scheme to provide political contributions (apparently to the Trump campaign or Republican groups, but we don\u2019t know the specifics) in exchange for a presidential pardon from Trump. The identities of the people involved in this matter are redacted, but the news makes clear that even before Trump lost, matters involving his pardon power have been under investigative scrutiny. Also on Tuesday, Attorney General Bill Barr returned to the headlines after a quiet period. Barr told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Perhaps to soften the blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s hopes from this admission, Barr also revealed that he has appointed John Durham \u2014 the US attorney investigating the conduct of the FBI\u2019s Trump campaign/Russia probe \u2014 as a special counsel, to make it more difficult for Biden to fire him. (Barr spent more than two hours at the White House Tuesday afternoon.) All in all, Trump is continuing to try to bend law enforcement agencies to his will \u2014 but having limited success of late. So he\u2019s being increasingly drawn to the pardon power, which he can exercise on his own authority, to save his close associates and family members from possible legal consequences. Around midday Tuesday, I wrote about how \u201cTrump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up,\u201d because his recent pardon for Flynn contained preemptive aspects, and because he was reportedly discussing a similarly preemptive pardon for his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the news of the day wasn\u2019t done. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt later reported that Trump has also talked with advisers about potentially granting preemptive pardons to his three eldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The business dealings of both the Trump Organization and the Kushner family have come under investigative scrutiny, and Donald Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer to try and get dirt on Hillary Clinton was also scrutinized as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  But none of these have resulted in any criminal charges against Trump\u2019s children or Kushner. So any hypothetical pardon would have to be quite broadly written and preemptive. (It also could not cover state crimes, which could be a problem, as the major Trump Organization investigation is being pursued by New York state prosecutors.) It would also, of course, be a stunning and unprecedented use of executive power for a president to grant broad immunity from federal criminal prosecution to his children. Some Trump allies, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, are arguing that the move would be justified because they expect prosecutors under Biden to pursue a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of people close to Trump.  Yet if Trump \u2014 or his children \u2014 have political ambitions in 2024, that might present an incentive to hold back on the broadest possible uses of the pardon power.  Just as Trump has been turning more attention to how far he wants to go in using his pardon power, news broke that federal investigators are already looking into what they view as a corrupt effort to get such a pardon from Trump. The revelation came from a newly unsealed court opinion by Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The opinion is heavily redacted, though, so we are missing key details, including the identities of the people involved in this purported scheme. But there\u2019s a fair amount we can piece together from the unredacted bits. The gist is that investigators say there are two separate schemes aimed at getting a certain person a pardon or sentence reduction.  Investigators uncovered these two purported schemes while reviewing material seized in the course of a preexisting investigation. But there was one issue: One of the people involved in lobbying the White House was a lawyer. So investigators wanted to make sure they had a judge\u2019s sign-off that reviewing communications involving that person wouldn\u2019t violate attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell gave them that sign-off \u2014 because the communications in question were also copied to another person, who was not an attorney. Speculation churned on Twitter about who could have been seeking this pardon. There are a few clues \u2014 the person appears to have a short last name and appears to be in Bureau of Prisons custody. These facts don\u2019t fit most of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d among the president\u2019s criminally entangled associates, so it\u2019s possible that the pardon-seeker is someone who has received little news coverage so far. There\u2019s no indication yet that anyone has been indicted as a result of this investigation. But Judge Howell unsealed the opinion \u2014 issued back in August \u2014 after giving the government three months to take further investigative steps. The identities of the people are redacted because they haven\u2019t yet been charged.  It\u2019s also important to note that no assertion of any knowing wrongdoing on the part of President Trump or White House officials is present in the unredacted parts of the document. (\u201cPardon investigation is Fake News!\u201d Trump tweeted.) But it certainly suggests that unscrupulous people are trying to benefit from Trump\u2019s pardon powers. Attorney General Bill Barr has kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, but he made news on a number of fronts on Tuesday. First, Barr told Michael Balsamo of the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d The statement got a great deal of attention because it flew in the face of Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him because of widespread fraud. But it\u2019s notable because, despite Barr\u2019s well-deserved reputation as a staunch political ally of Trump\u2019s, he isn\u2019t willing to go so far as to back Trump\u2019s election fraud claims. Second, and perhaps to soften this blow for Trump, Barr told the Associated Press \u2014 and also Congress \u2014 that he has named US Attorney John Durham as a special counsel. Back in early 2019, Barr tasked Durham, the US attorney for Connecticut, with probing the US government\u2019s handling of the investigation of Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Since then, Durham\u2019s investigation has unfolded mostly behind the scenes. (The sole charge has been FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith\u2019s guilty plea over falsifying a document used in a surveillance application \u2014 a matter already uncovered by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.) It\u2019s unclear whether Durham has found serious misconduct beyond Clinesmith. But Trump and his supporters have long hyped the prospect that Durham will bring charges against top former government officials who investigated the president. Barr reportedly placed heavy pressure on Durham to finish at least some of his work before the 2020 election, but Durham\u2019s top deputy Nora Dannehy resigned in protest in September, and Durham ended up making no further public moves before the election. Barr\u2019s appointment of Durham as special counsel \u2014 made in mid-October, but not announced until Tuesday \u2014 is evidently meant to shield Durham from potentially being fired in the Biden administration (since a special counsel can only be fired for \u201cgood cause\u201d). As for why we\u2019re only learning of this now, Barr suggested he didn\u2019t want to make the announcement before the election to avoid influencing the result.  But for Trump allies, this isn\u2019t enough. Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan reports that Trump allies saw the special counsel appointment as \u201ca smokescreen to forestall the release of the so-called Durham report,\u201d and that the president has even mused about firing Barr.  Barr visited the White House on Tuesday and stayed there for more than two hours; Swan reports that the attorney general was meeting with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. It is not known what they discussed.",

    "article_text": "The rise in murders in the US, explained As if the Covid-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t bad enough, America is also seeing a surge in homicides this year. A new report, by the Council on Criminal Justice, found homicides have increased sharply this year across 21 US cities with relevant data: \u201cHomicide rates increased by 42% during the summer and 34% in the fall over the summer and fall of 2019.\u201d Other data, from crime analyst Jeff Asher, found murder is up 36 percent throughout the year so far, compared to the same period in 2019, in a sample of 51 US cities. A preliminary FBI report also found murders up 15 percent nationwide in the first half of 2020. The increase in homicides is large and widespread enough to raise serious alarms for criminologists and other experts. So what\u2019s going on? Some experts have cited the protests this summer over the police killings of George Floyd and others \u2014 which could\u2019ve had a range of effects, from officers pulling back from their duties to greater community distrust in police, leading to more unchecked violence. Others point to the bad economy. Another potential factor is a huge increase in gun purchases this year. Still others posit boredom and social displacement as a result of physical distancing leading people to cause more trouble. Above all, though, experts caution it\u2019s simply been a very unusual year with the Covid-19 pandemic. That makes it difficult to say what, exactly, is happening with crime rates. \u201cThe current year, 2020, is an extreme deviation from baseline \u2014 extreme,\u201d Tracey Meares, founding director at the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, previously told me. That offers a bit of good news: It\u2019s possible that the end of the pandemic will come and homicide rates will fall again, as they generally have for the past few decades in the US. But no one knows for sure if that will happen, or if we\u2019re now seeing a shift in long-term trends. Uncertainty about what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t exactly new in the field of criminal justice. Rates of crime and violence have plummeted over the past few decades in the US, yet there is no agreed-upon explanation for why. There are theories applying the best evidence, research, and data available, ranging from changes in policing to a drop in lead exposure to the rise of video games. But there\u2019s no consensus. That a decades-long phenomenon is still so hard to explain shows the need for humility before jumping to conclusions about the current trends. \u201cWe don\u2019t know nearly enough to know what\u2019s going on at the given moment,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, director of the Justice Tech Lab, previously told me. \u201cThe current moment is so unusual for so many different reasons that \u2026 it\u2019s really hard to speculate about broad phenomena that are driving these trends when we\u2019re not even sure if there\u2019s a trend yet.\u201d All of that said, here\u2019s what we do know. There are several good sources, from criminologists, economists, and other data analysts, for what\u2019s happened with crime and violence so far this year: an analysis by Jeff Asher; a Council on Criminal Justice report written by Richard Rosenfeld and Ernesto Lopez; City Crime Stats, a website from the University of Pennsylvania set up by David Abrams, Priyanka Goonetilleke, Elizabeth Holmdahl, and Kathy Qian; and a preliminary report from the FBI. Crime analyst Jeff Asher offers the most recent data, looking at crime trends in 51 US cities in 2020 so far compared to 2019. He found murders are up 36 percent. Despite previous comments by President Donald Trump blaming the increase on Democrat-run cities, Asher found murders are up about 36 percent in both cities with Democratic mayors and those with Republican mayors. In a smaller sample of US cities, he found violent crime overall is flat and property crimes are down. The Council on Criminal Justice report, updated in November, analyzed crime in 28 US cities, ranging in size from Los Angeles to St. Petersburg, Florida, through October. The authors looked for \u201cstructural breaks,\u201d in which reported crime increased or decreased more than would be expected, based on data from previous years. They found structural breaks in homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault increases, particularly starting in the summer. There weren\u2019t significant increases in domestic assault (although the data for domestic violence is fairly limited), and robbery was actually down. Other kinds of crime, including larceny and drug offenses, largely decreased. Here\u2019s the graph for homicide increases: \u201cThere were 610 more homicides in the 21 cities in the summer and fall of 2020 than during the same period in 2019,\u201d the report found. City Crime Stats\u2019 data complicates matters a bit, comparing the 2020 crime trends in 28 major cities to a five-year baseline. With this approach, the homicide increases don\u2019t seem quite as dramatic in many cities, and other types of crime appear to be mostly down as well. Still, homicides do seem to be significantly up in many of the cities included in the City Crime Stats data set.  Here, for example, is Chicago\u2019s homicide trend, which shows this year\u2019s rate (the red line) rising above the five-year baseline (the gray line and shading) at several points throughout the year: There\u2019s a lot of variation from city to city. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, New York City, and Philadelphia are on the high end of homicides or seeing a flat-out increase. Baltimore, Boston, and Columbus are close to historical trends or actually down. Overall, though, Abrams said that his data suggests there was a significant increase in homicides from May to June: \u201cWe did find a statistically significant increase in homicides \u2014 about 21 percent \u2014 in aggregate in the cities we looked at in the month after versus before those protests,\u201d he previously told me, cautioning we can\u2019t say with any confidence if the protests were the cause. \u201cSame for shootings, but that\u2019s from a smaller number of cities.\u201d A preliminary FBI report confirmed these other reports\u2019 findings for the first half of 2020. It found a 15 percent increase in murders, a 5 percent increase in aggravated assaults, and an 8 percent decrease in property crime nationwide from January through June, compared to the same time period in 2019. The FBI will likely release a report for all of 2020 later in 2021. In Chicago, as well as some other cities, the apparent increase in homicides began before the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. And in some cases, as in Chicago, the spike abruptly ended almost as quickly as it started, only to surge again weeks later, after the protests had calmed. So it\u2019s hard to blame only the protests for a spike \u2014 especially because we know that other factors likely played a role, such as the start of summer, when crime tends to go up, and the end of stay-at-home orders. City-by-city variation isn\u2019t unique to 2020. It\u2019s expected, even when talking about national crime waves or declines, to see some places go up and others go down for different kinds of crime. The US is a big country, and a range of local factors can affect different kinds of crime. Still, there\u2019s enough in the four data sets to draw some conclusions: Homicides are up significantly this year. But other kinds of crime, including violent crime overall, aren\u2019t up and may actually have decreased so far this year. There was also a brief spike in burglaries in major cities starting in late May \u2014 an increase that was so brief and contained to specific cities that experts told me it was almost certainly due to the riots and looting surrounding some Black Lives Matter protests. As Asher noted on Twitter, a disconnect between murders and other crimes would be odd: \u201cViolent crime and murder almost always move in the same direction and they are never this far apart nationally.\u201d One way to reconcile this may be the nature of crime reporting. All of this data is based on reports to governments, typically local police departments. But with people stuck at home, and no government agency operating normally this year, perhaps these reports are just less likely to happen or get picked up, especially lower-level crimes involving drugs or stolen property. At the same time, it\u2019s far harder for a homicide to go completely unreported \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to ignore a dead person. This is why, for much of US history, the homicide rate has been used as a proxy for violent crime overall: The nature of homicide made it a more reliable metric than others for crime. In other words, it\u2019s possible that other kinds of crime are up this year, but they\u2019re simply going unreported. At any rate, homicides are up significantly. One note on domestic violence: Some activists and experts worried it would increase this year as people were forced to stay home more often. The Council on Criminal Justice report and City Crime Stats\u2019 analysis suggest that\u2019s not the case, showing no significant change or a drop in some places. But there\u2019s reason for skepticism: Both sources are pulling data from a limited number of cities. And reporting limitations may especially apply to domestic violence, since this year victims are potentially more likely to be trapped with their abusers and unable to make a phone call for help. There are plenty of caveats to all this data. Much of it only represents trends in large US cities, which means it might not be representative of the country as a whole. And it only covers 2020 through November at the latest. But the trends, particularly with homicides, are very alarming. So why are homicides up? When I posed this question to experts, they again cautioned that no one can say with certainty what\u2019s going on. That said, they offered some possible explanations, based on the limited information we have so far: 1) The pandemic has really messed things up: Looming over absolutely every discussion about 2020 is the Covid-19 pandemic. That\u2019s no different for discussions about crime and violence. This year is very unusual, with many forced to stay at home and living in fear of a new, deadly virus. That could lead to all sorts of unpredictable behaviors that experts don\u2019t understand yet and might take years to explain. 2) Depolicing led to more violence: In response to the 2014 and 2015 waves of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, officers in some cities pulled back, either out of fear that any act of aggressive policing could get them in trouble or in a counterprotest against Black Lives Matter. While protesters have challenged the crime-fighting effectiveness of police, there is a sizable body of evidence that more, and certain kinds of, policing do lead to less crime. Given that, some experts said that depolicing in response to protests could have led to more violence \u2014 what some in years past called the \u201cFerguson effect,\u201d after the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and also seen in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray. 3) Lack of trust in police led to more violence: In response to the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d in 2015, some experts offered a different view of what was happening: Maybe people had lost trust in the police and, as a result, they relied more on street justice and other illegal activities to resolve interpersonal disputes \u2014 an interpretation of \u201clegal cynicism,\u201d explained well in Jill Leovy\u2019s Ghettoside and supported by some empirical research. Perhaps Floyd\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests led to a similar phenomenon this year. 4) More guns led to more gun violence: There\u2019s been a big surge in gun buying this year, seemingly in response to concerns about personal safety during a pandemic. And as the research has shown time and time again, more guns mean more gun violence. A recent, preliminary study from researchers at UC Davis already concluded that gun purchases led to more gun violence than there would be otherwise through May this year. That could have further exacerbated homicide increases. 5) Overwhelmed hospitals led to more deaths: One way to explain a flat or dropping violent crime rate as homicides rise is that the violent crime was deadlier than usual. With health care systems across the US at times close to capacity or at capacity due to Covid-19, maybe hospitals and their staff couldn\u2019t treat violent crime victims as well \u2014 increasing the chances they died this year. That could translate to more deaths, and homicides, even if violent crime remained flat or declined. 6) Idle hands led to more violence: Throughout the pandemic, a lot of people have been bored \u2014 with forms of entertainment, from restaurants to movie theaters, closed down. Schools are limited or closed too, and millions have been newly unemployed. Other support programs that can prevent violence were shuttered due to the closures. All of that could have led to conflict, and possibly more crime and violence. But, experts cautioned, this is speculative, with little evidence so far to support it. 7) A bad economy led to more violence: With the economy tanking this year, some people may have been pushed to desperate acts to make ends meet. Disruptions in the drug market, as product and customers dried up in a bad economy, may have led to more violent competition over what\u2019s left. The bad economy also left local and state governments with less funding for social supports that can keep people out of trouble. All of that, and more, could have contributed to more crime and violence \u2014 but this, too, is still very speculative. Another possibility: None of these explanations is right. With limited data in strange times, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turns out we have no idea what\u2019s going on right now. \u201cWe can bet on it being unpredictable,\u201d Doleac said. Again, there\u2019s still no consensus about what\u2019s caused crime to decline since the 1990s. In that context, it\u2019s no surprise there\u2019s nowhere near a consensus as to why a homicide spike has occurred so far this year. It\u2019s possible that before we understand why it\u2019s happening, the year\u2019s alarming homicide trends could recede. It\u2019s happened before: In 2005 and 2006, the homicide rate briefly increased, only to start declining again before hitting record lows in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the rates also spiked again only to start to dip after. In both instances, these years were effectively blips and the overall crime decline America has seen for the past three decades continued. Maybe after this very weird year ends, crime and violence trends will, similarly, go back to the previous normal. But that\u2019s not a guarantee \u2014 and it\u2019s not something we should rely on, experts said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why crime and violence went down,\u201d John Roman, a criminal justice expert at NORC at the University of Chicago, previously told me. \u201cBeing able to say we should expect this unexplained phenomenon to continue strikes me as sort of irrational.\u201d Even if we can\u2019t explain what may be causing a homicide spike, there are certain strategies that might help fight crime in the short term \u2014 such as deploying police in crime hot spots (though that would have to be done carefully and with reforms, given the current political climate around policing), a \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d program that targets the few people in a community engaging in violence with a mix of support and sanctions, and using civilian \u201cinterrupters\u201d to personally intervene in cases in which violence seems likely to break out. Notably, a lot of this work is done at the local and state level, where the vast majority of police departments are based. The federal government can incentivize certain practices, like President-elect Joe Biden has proposed doing, but it ultimately falls on cities, counties, and states to carry out new or revised approaches. Many of the evidence-based approaches rely on in-person contact, which requires ending the pandemic. \u201cThe police, public health, and community approaches to violence reduction require that people meet face-to-face; they cannot be replaced by Zoom,\u201d Rosenfeld and Lopez wrote in one of their reports. \u201cAn underappreciated consequence of the pandemic is how social-distancing requirements have affected outreach to high-risk individuals.\u201d So the first priority should be to end the pandemic \u2014 ending its potential ripple effects on crime and enabling evidence-based approaches that can help reduce crime. But to do that, the US public and governments will need to truly embrace strategies that have worked for countries like South Korea and Germany against Covid-19: physical distancing, masking, and testing, tracing, and isolating the sick. In this sense, Trump\u2019s failures to address Covid-19 may be leading to more violence. \u201cSeeing what\u2019s happening with these [crime] numbers can point us to or at least get us thinking about what potential policy levers we could employ that would be helpful,\u201d Doleac said. \u201cOtherwise, our attention is probably better focused on making sure we\u2019re all wearing masks.\u201d Beyond the pandemic, police are going to have more trouble fighting crime \u2014 including any current or future spikes \u2014 if large segments of the community don\u2019t trust them. That\u2019s where police reform comes into play. It\u2019s a complicated topic, separate from a possible spike in violence this year. But, in short, experts say police should, at a minimum, show the communities they serve that they understand the concerns, acknowledge mistakes, and will change how officers are trained and deployed. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance that protests against police will flare up, just as they did from 2014 to 2016 and have again this year. If protests lead to more violence \u2014 whether by leading to depolicing, or sowing and exposing distrust in law enforcement \u2014 that\u2019s going to create public safety problems. To put it another way: There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about crime, why it happens, and how to stop it. But it\u2019s going to be much easier to wrap our heads around these issues once things get closer to how they should be \u2014 and that means seriously addressing the pandemic and protests against police brutality. Unfortunately, the US is going in the opposite direction, with a surge of Covid-19 this fall and winter and Trump exacerbating police-community tensions with his rhetoric and push to deploy unsolicited federal agents in some US cities. \u201cHow optimistic should we be for the rest of the summer?\u201d Roman said. \u201cI think the answer is not terribly optimistic, because none of these factors seem to be abating with the return of Covid.\u201d  ",

    "article_text": "How Trump\u2019s blizzard of misleading fundraising emails explains his refusal to concede President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing effort to overturn the election results is almost certain to fail, because Joe Biden clearly and decisively won the election. But the president has self-interested reasons for dragging out the fight as long as he can. The nearly 500 emails blasted out by the Trump campaign in November raised at least $170 million after Election Day, as Will Steakin and Soo Rin Kim reported for ABC on Tuesday. (For context, the Trump campaign account\u2019s best monthly fundraising haul before the election came in September, when they raised a mere $81 million.) They\u2019ve done so with highly misleading insinuations that the money is funding Trump\u2019s farcical legal challenges of the election results, when a careful reading of the emails\u2019 fine print shows the money is largely being raised for things like paying down campaign debt and funding Trump\u2019s post-presidency operation.  And it won\u2019t be especially hard for Trump to eventually route some of his new leadership PAC\u2019s windfall into his own pockets. (A \u201cleadership PAC\u201d is a type of political committee formed by current or former elected officials.) \u201cWhile he can\u2019t just cut himself a massive check, he could rent out Mar-a-Lago for an obscene amount of money \u2014 leadership PAC money \u2014 to give a speech himself, and that would be totally legal,\u201d Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW), told Vox in an interview. \u201cSo if you view the Trump administration as one long grift to redirect money from taxpayers and political supporters into Trump properties, this would be a good move to do that.\u201d But the fact that Trump could reroute contributions solicited by his campaign to his own pockets would likely come as news to some of the Trump followers who have ponied up during a time when losing campaigns are usually winding down operations. That\u2019s because the emails the campaign continues to bombard people with nearly a month after Trump\u2019s loss to Biden are misleading at best. On November 15, for instance, the Trump campaign sent out an email that framed its post-election fundraising pitch around the president\u2019s failing legal fight to overturn the results. \u201cPresident Trump is FIGHTING BACK to defend the integrity of this Election, but he can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d the email said. \u201cHe needs YOU to step up and join him by contributing to our critical Election Defense Fund. This is so important that he\u2019s giving YOU the opportunity to increase your impact by 1000%.\u201d There\u2019s just one problem: There is no such thing as Trump\u2019s \u201cElection Defense Fund.\u201d Instead, as Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee detailed for the Washington Post, the majority of the money raised by email pitches of that sort goes to the leadership PAC Libowitz mentioned: According to @TrumpEmail, a Twitter account that has closely monitored Trump\u2019s fundraising emails for three years, the tone of the missives has subtly shifted in recent days from hyping the fake \u201cElection Defense Fund\u201d to saying things like, \u201cOne thing has become clear these last few days, I am the American People\u2019s ALL-TIME favorite President.\u201d The email that contained that claim also cited already-debunked claims from disreputable outlets like the Epoch Times to insinuate that the 2020 election is still up for grabs.  But the one constant is the emails aim at getting supporters to open their wallets \u2014 which they have. Campaign officials told the Post the bulk of the fundraising has come from small-dollar donors; the emails have activated \u201cthe president\u2019s base of loyal and fervent financial supporters, who tend to contribute the most when they feel the president is under siege or facing unfair political attacks.\u201d  Unlike PACs that are tied to chambers of Congress, there are very few restrictions on what Trump can do with the leadership PAC money. In addition to the possibility of Trump using the funds to hold events at his properties (and thereby reroute it to his own pockets), Libowitz explained that he could use them to continue to hold political rallies around the country. \u201cRenting out a basketball arena does not come cheaply, and given his history of not paying places back and the fact that he\u2019s not a candidate, or at least not a current nominee, it\u2019s much more likely people will require cash up front\u201d after he leaves office, Libowitz said. \u201cSo he could rent out Trump Force One to the leadership PAC and charge his leadership PAC for his own use or his own plane to go to a rally. It basically just opens up a bunch of new ways he can continue to bring in money from his supporters that he can then redirect to his businesses and then, of course, to himself and his family.\u201d So while it would be in the best interests of the country for Trump to acknowledge that he lost and psychologically prepare his followers for the reality that Biden will be inaugurated as president next month, dragging it out for as long possible allows him to keep grifting. \u201cI think there is a question of whether this is just one last gasp of trying to milk every dollar he can out of his supporters, or whether people have so convinced themselves that he\u2019s going to find some secret way to become president that they\u2019ll continue to give him money,\u201d Libowitz said.",

    "article_text": "The battle over Trump\u2019s huge UAE arms deal, explained On Monday evening, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met for a classified briefing with Trump administration officials to hear about a proposed $23 billion weapons sale to the United Arab Emirates. Right when it ended, one of the attendees blasted what had transpired behind closed doors. \u201cJust a mind blowing number of unsettled issues and questions the Administration couldn\u2019t answer,\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. \u201cHard to overstate the danger of rushing this though.\u201d That remark underscored the growing political fight over the arms deal announced in early November, a standoff that could severely impact America\u2019s relations with its authoritarian ally and the military balance in the Middle East.  President Donald Trump wants to sell up to 50 F-35 fighter jets, nearly 20 Reaper drones, and around 14,000 bombs and munitions to the UAE \u2014 and he wants to do it before President-elect Joe Biden enters the Oval Office and potentially scuttles the sale.  The administration has explicitly linked the massive arms package to Trump\u2019s broader efforts to counter Iran and to the UAE\u2019s normalization of relations with Israel in August. \u201cThis is in recognition of our deepening relationship and the UAE\u2019s need for advanced defense capabilities to deter and defend itself against heightened threats from Iran,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing his authorization of the sales. \u201cThe UAE\u2019s historic agreement to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively transform the region\u2019s strategic landscape.\u201d But some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with certain activist groups, oppose the proposed weapons transfer, saying a country responsible for killing civilians in Yemen and funding Russian mercenaries in Libya doesn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded with even better US-made weapons.  \u201cTo sell such advanced military equipment to the UAE now would be to endorse those policies and threaten US interests and regional stability,\u201d said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy, who\u2019s leading an effort by arms control organizations and human rights groups to stop the sale. Which means the next 50 days before Biden takes over will see a nasty tussle over one of Trump\u2019s last major foreign policy initiatives, one he\u2019s trying to ram through before the clock runs out. \u201cThis is happening way too fast,\u201d said Michael Hanna, a Middle East security expert at the Century Foundation in New York City. \u201cProcess is important, substance is important, and neither is good here.\u201d The UAE has long wanted advanced fighter jets and top-of-the-line drones, which would make it a greater, more powerful player in the region \u2014 not just militarily, but politically, too. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going to war here. We\u2019re talking about affecting change in the Middle East,\u201d said Dalia Fahmy, an expert on the UAE\u2019s foreign policy at Long Island University. \u201cThe UAE is reasserting itself in the region. It\u2019s all about being able to leverage that perceived power.\u201d In other words, the UAE wants the world\u2019s most advanced warplane, the F-35, and surveillance and attack drones because it could then throw its weight around in the Middle East. That sounds fine in principle \u2014 after all, most nations seek to increase their power and influence whenever they can. But one big question is how \u2014 and where \u2014 exactly the UAE may try to do that. The sale is \u201cnot helpful [for the US] if there is greater adventurism in Libya or the Horn of Africa,\u201d said a State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to press. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe helpful in a theoretical multilateral framework\u201d against Iran. Both Trump and Biden would certainly rather see the country use the weapons against Iran in case of a war and not, say, to bomb innocent men, women, and children in Yemen, where the UAE is fighting a war as part of a Saudi-led coalition. Figuring out what assurances the US received from the UAE ahead of the sales took up much of Monday\u2019s classified Senate hearing, according to two Senate sources familiar with the discussion.  Murphy\u2019s tweet made clear the answers senators received weren\u2019t satisfactory \u2014 and now he and others are trying to stop the transfers from happening. On November 18, three senators \u2014 Democrats Murphy and Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Robert Menendez, along with Republican Rand Paul \u2014 introduced four joint resolutions to stop the UAE arms deal from happening. \u201cCongress is once again stepping in to serve as a check to avoid putting profit over US national security and that of our allies, and to hopefully prevent a new arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Menendez said in a statement at the time. Those resolutions must be voted on and passed by December 11 or they will expire, clearing Trump\u2019s pathway to the sale. But whether or not the blocking effort works, the resolutions do help make clear the five main arguments against the deal. The first, as mentioned above, is that the UAE could use the weapons indiscriminately, killing civilians in Yemen or elsewhere. Without clear guarantees that that won\u2019t happen, the senators and activists don\u2019t want the measure moving forward. The second concern is that Israel could lose what\u2019s called its \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d (QME) in the Middle East. Simply put, US policy since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war has been to ensure that Israel has more powerful forces than its Arab neighbors. Israel and others fear giving the UAE F-35s and drones might erode that advantage. However, that issue \u201chas receded in importance\u201d more recently, said Barbara Leaf, the US ambassador to the UAE from 2014 to 2018. The main reason is that in October, Israel\u2019s government dropped its objection to the F-35 transfers in particular, soon after the Pentagon promised Jerusalem its edge would remain intact.  \u201cIt\u2019s now more about the foreign policy dimensions of the proposed sale,\u201d Leaf told me. Which brings us to the third objection: that the UAE having this advanced weaponry could change the balance of power in the Middle East, making the Gulf country an even stronger, more influential regional player. If that were the case, experts told me, the UAE might use its newfound strength to attack its enemies, namely Iran, on its own and back other proxies in the area. But some aren\u2019t so worried about that possibility. \u201cThis won\u2019t change the military balance in the Middle East,\u201d said Leaf, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cIran\u2019s missile and nonconventional arsenals are formidable and could wreak immense damage, even if the UAE gets the F-35.\u201d The fourth concern is the potential for an arms race. Basically, if the UAE gets a lot of advanced weapons, others \u2014 like Qatar and Iran, the UAE\u2019s adversaries \u2014 might want them, too. At that point, each country may continue to buy more and more weapons until the region becomes increasingly militarized and dangerous. That\u2019s an outcome many experts hope to avoid, although such a possibility remains far off. The fifth worry is that the Trump administration is ramming through in a matter of months a deal that would normally take years to complete. \u201cThis is definitely being rushed through. That\u2019s abnormal and bad practice,\u201d said the Century Foundation\u2019s Hanna. What normally happens is that a deal is painstakingly worked out between the two parties first, then reviewed closely by the State Department and the Pentagon, and then long-term consultations with Congress begin. One item up for debate would be the Israel issue, for example, which could take years to hash out.  In this case, the Trump administration wants to go from an announcement in November to a sale before January 20, the day Biden is sworn in as president. That\u2019s just unheard of, especially for an arms package of this size. That\u2019s why one Senate aide told me they don\u2019t want to see the deal go through before \u201cthey\u2019ve dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s.\u201d Until then, the backlash against the deal is likely to persist.

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up Outgoing President Donald Trump kicked off what will likely be the first in a series of pardons of his associates last week, with his pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators back in 2017 \u2014 but that\u2019s not all Trump pardoned him for. The typical way pardons work is that the recipient is pardoned for specific crimes. But Flynn\u2019s stands out because it also has preemptive aspects \u2014 that is, it\u2019s written broadly to try to pardon Flynn for possible crimes he hasn\u2019t even been charged with. Preemptive pardons aren\u2019t unprecedented, but they are unusual, and come far closer to a sort of presidential declaration that the president\u2019s associates should be above the law. And Trump\u2019s use of the tactic for Flynn hints at just how far he could go in his final weeks in office. Several of Trump\u2019s former top campaign advisers \u2014 Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone \u2014 have been charged with or convicted of specific crimes, for which they could be pardoned. (Trump already commuted Roger Stone\u2019s sentence but has not yet granted him a full pardon.) The universe of potential preemptive pardons, though, is far broader. For while many Trump associates have been charged with crimes, an even greater number have been investigated but have not faced any charges. For instance, there\u2019s the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt reported Tuesday morning that, \u201cas recently as last week,\u201d Giuliani discussed \u201cthe possibility of receiving a pre-emptive pardon\u201d from Trump (though Giuliani denied this on Twitter). Federal prosecutors in New York have probed Giuliani\u2019s business activities and indicted two of his associates. And some of Trump\u2019s allies are urging him to take preemptive pardons even further. \u201cI\u2019d tell President Trump to pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Fox host Sean Hannity said Monday. It remains unclear whether Trump will try to go that far (particularly, a self-pardon may not be legal and the president can\u2019t pardon state crimes), but it\u2019s clear enough that his lame-duck pardon shenanigans are only getting started.  In December 2017, Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements (lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador). Since then, his case has become a protracted legal saga \u2014 first Flynn tried to withdraw his plea, then a new Justice Department team sought to have the case against Flynn thrown out, and the judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan, has been weighing whether he should permit this latter move. Last week, Trump announced that he had pardoned Flynn, but no documentation for that pardon clarifying its parameters was released until Monday night. Here\u2019s what it looks like: The pardon begins by listing the crime to which Flynn pleaded guilty: making false statements to federal investigators. But it covers a whole lot more than that. Flynn is also pardoned for: So this is not a typical pardon, targeted at crimes someone has actually been charged with or convicted of. It\u2019s a preemptive pardon, designed to shield Flynn from being charged in the future. In that respect, it\u2019s similar to the unconditional preemptive pardon President Gerald Ford granted his former boss and predecessor Richard Nixon \u2014 a sweeping pardon for any criminal offenses Nixon may have committed during the course of his presidency.  The Flynn pardon is not quite as broad as that, but it\u2019s clearly tailored to try to wipe out the possibility that Flynn will face any further charges connected to the current case against him, or in any way related to the Mueller investigation. The New York Times has already confirmed that one preemptive pardon is under discussion \u2014 for Giuliani. Late last year, news broke that federal prosecutors in the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) were scrutinizing Giuliani\u2019s business and finances, exploring his contacts with former top Ukrainian officials, and investigating a host of potential crimes (including obstruction of justice, money laundering, serving as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, mail fraud, and wire fraud).  Two of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted on charges of campaign finance violations that October. The pair allegedly had been helping Giuliani make connections with Ukrainian officials who claimed to know of scandalous information about the Biden family, that could be helpful to Trump. (The revelation of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get dirt on Biden from Ukrainian officials eventually resulted in Trump\u2019s impeachment.) This year, there have been few new developments in the matter. CNN reported that the investigation into Giuliani \u201cwas upended by the coronavirus pandemic, limiting prosecutors\u2019 ability to interview witnesses, collect further evidence, and meet with the grand jury.\u201d Giuliani has not been charged, but if this investigation is serious and still underway, he\u2019d obviously be hoping for a pardon while his client is still in charge of the executive branch. There has also been some discussion \u2014 at least from Sean Hannity \u2014 about preemptive pardons for members of the Trump family.  Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. faced scrutiny in the Mueller investigation but ultimately wasn\u2019t charged. Trump himself also was probed for obstructing justice, but Mueller opted not to charge him, in part because Trump was the sitting president.  President Trump could attempt to pardon himself, but it\u2019s unclear if that would be legal (a popular theory among the #Resistance is that Trump will resign early and let newly installed President Mike Pence pardon him). One issue here, though, is that the president has no power to pardon state crimes \u2014 and he is currently under investigation for potential bank and insurance fraud in New York state.  Now, if Trump truly does plan to run for president again in 2024, he might have political reasons to hold back on the broadest assertions of his pardon powers. Then again, he might feel he\u2019s appropriately laid the groundwork to defend those moves, having disparaged any investigations of himself or anyone close to him as \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d  Finally, there\u2019s been a notable pattern among some who are likely seeking pardons: They\u2019ve tended to champion Trump\u2019s lies and conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Giuliani, of course, has been in charge of Trump\u2019s post-election legal fight, spreading false claims of widespread voter fraud while reportedly seeking a preemptive pardon.  Attorney Sidney Powell \u2014 Flynn\u2019s lawyer \u2014 stood up with Giuliani at a press conference two weeks ago making particularly bizarre claims of fraud. (She asserted that the voting systems company Dominion rigged the vote against Trump, in part because there was \u201ccommunist money\u201d involved and that the company had ties to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.) Powell has filed lawsuits as well filled with similarly false claims. (Flynn himself has said \u201cthere is no doubt in my mind\u201d that Trump won in a \u201clandslide.\u201d) Bannon, too, has been spreading false information advancing Trump\u2019s stolen election narrative, and has been advising Giuliani behind the scenes, according to the Washington Post.  Whether or not there was any explicit quid pro quo involved here, it\u2019s clear that all these people were interested in pardons (in Powell\u2019s case, for her client), and that all these people knew the importance of pleasing the man who could issue those pardons. Indeed, the main champions of Trump\u2019s post-election fraud lies have been people who wanted Trump to pardon somebody \u2014 which is revealing of how much bad faith is at play here.  ",

    "article_text": "Joe Biden should do everything at once Joe Biden will become the US president during an extraordinary moment in history, one that could very well prove to be the calm before the storm, a brief prelude to dissolution and illiberalism. Trump\u2019s bid to become a full-on authoritarian failed, but Democrats could easily lose the House in a 2022 backlash. Biden could face total congressional opposition, even impeachment \u2014 as the recent baseless \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative has shown, if Republicans don\u2019t have any evidence, they\u2019ll just make something up.  Or maybe Democrats will keep the House and take the Senate in 2022, and legislation will become possible! Who knows? (The Georgia Senate runoffs are another big question mark.) If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past five years, it\u2019s that I definitely don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else does either. What we do know is that Republicans will wage full-on war on Biden from the second he takes office. They will generate fake conspiracies and controversies through right-wing media and social media. Conservative voters will be told again and again that Biden and Kamala Harris are uniquely dangerous traitors engaged in all sorts of elaborate evil plots. The entire conservative movement, from top to bottom, will view limiting Biden to one term as its primary strategic objective. And the movement will engage in misinformation, norm violation, procedural fuckery, and outright lawbreaking, if necessary, to achieve that objective.  The right will be what it is, what it has been becoming for decades now; expecting anything else would be madness. The question is how the Biden administration should behave, knowing all this. It would be foolish for anyone to claim to have all the answers, or any of the answers really, but in my mind the most pointed lesson about how to behave in a hopelessly partisan environment comes from Donald Trump himself. Before getting to that (suspense!), it\u2019s instructive to take a look back at some of the experiences of the administration for which Biden was vice president. When Barack Obama took office in 2009 in a deepening recession, he expected to receive some Republican help bailing out the economy. It\u2019s easy today to look back on that expectation as naive, but at the time it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. The economy was on the brink of disaster, the need was clear, and the depth of conservative backlash was not yet as evident as it would become later.  What happened instead was a wall of opposition from Republicans, built on bad-faith objections about deficit spending and government waste. With so little room to maneuver, Democrats were forced to negotiate with the tiny handful of moderate Republicans and the large handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate, holding the stimulus bill down to their arbitrary spending caps. In the end, the stimulus bill passed with zero Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. The result was an inadequate economic boost and a sluggish recovery that hobbled the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since it was widely agreed that \u201cpolitical capital\u201d was limited and Democrats could only take on one fight at a time, the question then became what to tackle next. The answer proved to be health care reform, perceived as a policy better developed and more widely supported in the Democratic caucus.  In July 2009, Democrats in the House introduced a health care plan based on a system that had been road-tested by Mitt Romney in his recent tenure as governor in Massachusetts. Many Democrats thought the process would take a few months, and then Congress could move on to climate change. Instead, again and again, Republicans lured Democrats into extended negotiations, only to withdraw support at the last minute over some new bad-faith objection (see: \u201cdeath panels\u201d). That left Democrats negotiating with their most conservative members, who did much the same thing (Joe Lieberman, may his name live in infamy). In the end, talks dragged on until March 2010, when Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act. It got no Republican votes, in the Senate or the House.  Then it was finally time for climate change, and the strategy there was yet more clever sequencing. Obama told Republicans that if they didn\u2019t cooperate on climate change legislation, he would regulate greenhouse gases via the Environmental Protection Agency, which would offer less flexibility and less ability to compensate hard-hit communities. The idea was that the threat of EPA regulations \u2014 made inevitable by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA judgment that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to the Clean Air Act \u2014 would frighten Republicans to the legislative table, where they could better defend their interests.  Instead, Republicans vowed implacable opposition to all of it. They would fight furiously against legislation when it was on the table and then fight regulations just as furiously when they came up. To a cool Vulcan mind like Obama\u2019s, it seemed entirely irrational, against Republicans\u2019 own best interests. At that point, he had not fully internalized the extent to which the conservative movement has become unleashed id, driven more by right-wing media than by Republican politicians, fueled by resentment and organized purely to defeat the libs.  In June 2009, when the climate bill passed the House, it got eight Republican votes. By mid-2010, it was dead in the water, with no hope of any Republican votes in the Senate. Democrats no longer had their filibuster-proof 60 seats, and there was nothing like the same support in the caucus that health care reform generated, so it never came to a Senate vote. It ended with a whimper, not a bang. As promised, Obama\u2019s EPA began slowly rolling out regulations, one at a time. It wasn\u2019t until late in his first term that auto mileage standards were finalized and into his second term before EPA got to power plants. Republicans were able to keep Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan tied up in court through the end of his second term. Then Trump took power and began a simultaneous all-fronts assault on Obama\u2019s regulations, unrolling them so fast it was difficult to even keep track. The theme of these stories is that Democrats relied on clever sequencing over and over again, imagining some amount of political capital (\u201ccredibility\u201d) that they could husband and spend strategically to get assistance across the aisle, at every juncture underestimating the ferocity and unanimity of Republican opposition. They kept behaving as though they would find good-faith negotiating partners, as though they were still in the postwar American era of relatively low (or at least manageable) polarization.  What too few of them realized was that they were already in a new era of near-total polarization, with the population sorted into like-minded enclaves, a bifurcated media ecosystem nurturing stacked (and diametrically opposed) \u201cmega-identities,\u201d and voters motivated primarily by \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d which is to say, hatred of the other side.  A fully polarized two-party system really is a zero-sum game. Any victories or gains by one side come at the other side\u2019s expense, even if the victory secures shared goals. The rational course for the party out of power is to fight with full intensity against everything, always, and that\u2019s what Republicans did under Obama. With scarcely any exceptions, from 2010 through 2020, they pushed in every case for maximal partisan advantage, no matter the stakes or possible cost.  The GOP has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a few close calls, but otherwise, its unprincipled pursuit of raw power has paid off handsomely. The party captured state legislatures in 2010 and was able to gerrymander itself minority rule in several states. It practically shut down Congress as a legislative body for six years of Obama\u2019s term. It blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and for its efforts got Neil Gorsuch. It ignored Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dying wishes and for its efforts got a 6-3 conservative Court majority that could last for generations.  Republicans blocked so many Democratic judicial nominations that Senate leader Harry Reid had to get rid of the judicial filibuster to keep the courts staffed. Then, when the GOP took control of the presidency and Senate, it used the absence of the filibuster to pack the federal courts full of hyper-ideological, young, often woefully unqualified judges. Rather than paying any price for total partisan warfare, Republicans were rewarded in 2016 with the presidency and both houses of Congress. After carrying the country to the brink of authoritarian crisis, it has now lost the House and the presidency. But Joe Biden has been left to tackle a virtually uncontrolled pandemic and millions of people out of work and on the verge of homelessness or food insecurity.  The GOP will likely retain control of the Senate, which means there will be no adequate economic recovery package and none of Biden\u2019s ambitious campaign plans will come to fruition. It has kept control of key state legislatures, so it will be able to gerrymander itself an advantage for another decade. The elections of 2022 will be another partisan brawl, and the odds are stacked against Democrats; the president\u2019s party has lost seats in every first-term midterm in the past 100 years, save three. If Republicans gain full control of Congress, impeachment becomes a real possibility, even if conviction is very unlikely. It\u2019s a grim situation, and Biden is starting out behind the eight-ball. How should he proceed? Here we return to the lesson that Trump has to teach Biden about life in hyperpolarized politics.  To wit: blitz. Do everything at once. No matter what the Biden administration does, it will be accused of socialism and corruption by the right. And the past several years have richly demonstrated that conservative parts of the country, particularly rural areas and low-density suburbs, are almost completely captured by right-wing media, from Fox on the TV to AM conservative radio to Sinclair-owned local news to the profusion of shady Facebook sources and groups, where misinformation is rapid and rampant.  Democrats badly need to address this media asymmetry. Despite what conservatives have convinced themselves, mainstream media outlets like CNN are not analogous to Fox, and Democrats have no comparable radio, local TV, or social media operations to carry their messages and narratives straight to voters where they live.  But that is long-term work, and 2022 is right around the corner.  The only thing Biden will have real control over is his administration and what it does. And his North Star, his organizing principle, should be doing as much good on as many fronts as fast as possible. Blitz. By constantly blundering forward, Trump has helped chart which US institutions and norms provide real resistance and which don\u2019t. The courts have tangibly restrained Trump; they have been the primary bulwark against him. But the chattering of the media and the political classes? Moral outrage? Precedent and tradition? Civil protest?  All of these have proven gossamer. Trump charged right through them like they were cotton candy. By constantly acting, being on the offensive, generating new stories and controversies, he simply overwhelmed the ability of the system to fasten on any one thing.  Biden should learn the lesson. All that matters is what gets done, put on paper and into law. The rest is vapor. The administration should staff up as rapidly as possible with ambitious young progressives and tell every single civil servant that the next two years are going to be a full sprint. Start immediately rewriting and reimplementing the environmental, public health, and worker safety regulations Trump has weakened. Reverse his immigration policies. Drop his lawsuits.  Reassess the social cost of carbon. Replace Trump\u2019s weak Affordable Clean Energy rule with more stringent carbon rules for the power sector. Ditch EPA\u2019s \u201csecret science\u201d rule and restock scientific advisory boards with actual scientists. Put a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on public land. Pledge the purchasing power of the federal government \u2014 around $500 billion a year \u2014 toward clean energy technology.  Through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), direct federal financing toward carbon reduction and clean energy across agencies. Use the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reject regulations from any agency that do not include both a climate and equity \u201cscreen\u201d to ensure that they reduce emissions and help the most vulnerable. Use the powers conferred by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill to integrate climate risks into the financial system.  I\u2019ve written more about what Biden can do on climate change without Congress. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews took a wider policy view with 10 big things Biden can do with executive powers, from forgiving student loan debt to reigning in factory farming. More ideas can be found here, here, here, and here, among other places. There\u2019s no shortage of ways for Biden to deploy the powers of the presidency, and he should maximize every one of them. All of these moves will elicit howls of outrage and court challenges from the right. Many will also infuriate the left, since they will inevitably fall short of Biden\u2019s grand campaign promises.  Biden can\u2019t control any of that. Doing less, negotiating more, relying on clever sequencing, chasing after receding promises of cooperation \u2014 none of that will solve anything, any more than it did for Obama. He can reach across the aisle, make it clear his door is open, but he shouldn\u2019t wait around for anyone to walk in. Biden\u2019s best chance is to try to overwhelm the system the way Trump did, by doing so much that it\u2019s impossible to make any one thing into a lasting story. He should launch so many simultaneous reforms that there\u2019s no time for right-wing media to make up lies about all of them or for the Supreme Court to hear them all. He should ignore bad-faith attacks and stay relentlessly on message about what\u2019s gotten done and what\u2019s getting done next. He should, at every juncture, get caught trying to make government work better for ordinary people. To succeed, all this must happen alongside Democratic Party efforts to improve messaging and media, get persistent party infrastructure on the ground in communities the party has neglected, and innovate on voter outreach and persuasion. (Aaron Strauss has some good ideas on that front.) But Biden has something the rest of the party at the federal level does not have: the power to improve Americans\u2019 lives in a visible way. More than anything else, cynicism about government\u2019s ability to do that is corroding US politics. The best thing Biden can do, morally and politically, is act, as much and as fast as possible, and then talk about it, and do more of it, and talk about it more. (And he should be clear about exactly who stands in the way of bigger, better changes, and why his name is Mitch McConnell.) The rest of it, he should ignore: the Washington chatter about the latest Republican accusations or catty infighting among Democratic factions, the cable news story or Twitter drama of the day, the latest offensive thing Trump or some Trump surrogate said, all of it. Bulldoze through it. The president has limited ability to control political discourse and drama, but he has an enormous capacity to change policy and direct resources. Biden should use that power while he has it, without hesitation or apology.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "Even Amy Coney Barrett appears skeptical of Trump\u2019s latest attempt to rig the census If the Supreme Court decides to actually decide Trump v. New York, a case asking if President Trump can exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census count, Trump is very likely to lose.  Both Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared very skeptical of acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall\u2019s attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy, which is unambiguously unconstitutional, during Monday\u2019s oral arguments. Add in the three liberal justices, and that\u2019s a majority of the Court that may be opposed to Trump\u2019s policy. Only Justice Samuel Alito offered much of a defense of it, so it\u2019s possible a ruling will be more lopsided than a 5-4 ruling. But the case is procedurally very messy. Several justices expressed doubts that the Court has jurisdiction to hear it now, though they could potentially take it up again after the census is finalized.  It\u2019s also unclear whether the Court should rule on this case on the expedited schedule originally proposed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department. The Justice Department had asked for the case to be decided before a December 31 statutory deadline to transmit the results of the 2020 census to Trump. But Wall seemed to concede early in Monday\u2019s arguments that the Commerce Department is \u201cnot currently on pace\u201d for that milestone, so Trump may not be able to meet a January 10 deadline to inform Congress of the new census\u2019s impact on representation in the US House of Representatives. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, becomes president at noon on January 20. And once he becomes president, he can render this case moot by rescinding Trump\u2019s policy excluding undocumented immigrants from the census, assuming that the census has not been finalized by that point. The Trump administration, in other words, appears to be engaged in a disorganized race against the clock to implement an unconstitutional policy before Trump\u2019s term expires. And the justices appear uncertain about whether to end it now, or whether to let it play out and potentially invalidate Trump\u2019s policy later. The New York case turns on a memorandum Trump issued in July, which provides that \u201cfor the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d Thus, if Trump gets his way, undocumented immigrants will not be counted when House representation is doled out to each of the 50 states following the census. About 10.6 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and nearly 20 percent live in California. So the nation\u2019s largest blue state could lose as many as three House seats if Trump succeeds in his plans to cut these immigrants out of the apportionment count. (The Republican-leaning state of Texas could also be hit hard, but Texas\u2019s Republican legislature is likely to draw gerrymandered maps that would impose the cost of any lost House seats on Democrats. California, by contrast, uses a bipartisan redistricting commission to draw legislative lines.) Trump\u2019s memo violates the unambiguous text of the Constitution. Under the 14th Amendment, \u201crepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.\u201d Undocumented immigrants are \u201cpersons.\u201d To get around this constitutional requirement, Trump claims that the 14th Amendment should not be read literally. \u201cAlthough the Constitution requires the \u2018persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,\u2019 to be enumerated in the census,\u201d Trump says in his memo, \u201cthat requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State\u2019s boundaries at the time of the census.\u201d On this narrow point, Trump is correct. There are some foreign nationals, such as tourists and foreign diplomats, who generally are not counted by the census, even if they are physically present when the census is being taken. \u201cThe term \u2018persons in each State,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s memo notes, \u201chas been interpreted to mean that only the \u2018inhabitants\u2019 of each State should be included.\u201d Yet, while Trump is largely correct that only \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state are counted for purposes of the census, Trump then claims a broad power to determine who counts as an inhabitant and who does not \u2014 and then he wields this assumed power to insist that undocumented immigrants are not inhabitants of the state where they reside. But this claim cannot be squared with the meaning of the word \u201cinhabitant.\u201d As the lower court that ruled against Trump in New York held, \u201cit does not follow that illegal aliens \u2014 a category defined by legal status, not residence \u2014 can be excluded\u201d from the census by claiming that they are not \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state. \u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the court explained, while quoting from Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary, \u201cthe ordinary definition of the term \u2018inhabitant\u2019 is \u2018one that occupies a particular place regularly, routinely, or for a period of time.\u2019\u201d Many undocumented immigrants reside in a state for \u201cmany years or even decades,\u201d the court continued. Such individuals are clearly \u201cinhabitants\u201d of the state where they live, even if they are not lawfully present. Trump\u2019s newest appointee to the Court, Barrett, offered a forceful rebuttal to the attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cA lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,\u201d Barrett told Wall. She added that there is evidence that \u201cin the founding era, an \u2018inhabitant\u2019 was a dweller, who lives and resides in a place.\u201d  Thus, an immigrant who has resided in a state for many months or years \u2014 or even one who has only lived there briefly \u2014 would count as an \u201cinhabitant.\u201d Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, also said that he believes there are \u201cforceful constitutional and statutory arguments\u201d against Trump\u2019s position. So it is very likely that a majority of the Court will vote to reject Trump\u2019s policy \u2014 if, that is, the Court decides this case at all. The policy laid out in Trump\u2019s July memo is categorical. The memo states that \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d So, the memo suggests that any undocumented immigrant should be excluded from the census for apportionment purposes. But acting Solicitor General Wall spent time in oral arguments claiming that the administration isn\u2019t sure how many undocumented immigrants it will be able to identify, or whether Trump will try to exclude more than a \u201csubset\u201d of the estimated 10-11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. This subset, which might only include immigrants who are currently being detained with an eye towards removal, could be much smaller than the total number of undocumented immigrants in the country. The reason why the question of how many immigrants will be excluded matters is because of a doctrine known as \u201cstanding.\u201d Broadly speaking, a plaintiff may not challenge a federal policy unless they can show that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that they will be injured by that policy. As a general rule, a state has standing to challenge a census-related policy if they are likely to lose House seats under that policy. But it is far more likely that one of the plaintiff states will lose representation if millions of undocumented immigrants are excluded from the census than if only maybe tens of thousands of immigrants are excluded. For this reason, several justices suggested that maybe the Court should wait to decide this case until after we know how many immigrants Trump will exclude. If the Court goes down that path, it\u2019s unclear what happens next. As noted above, Trump might not manage to send the final House appointment results to Congress before he leaves office. So the justices could be able to sit on this case until January 20, let President Biden rescind Trump\u2019s memo, and then declare the case moot. Alternatively, the Court could dismiss the case, let Trump do whatever he is going to do, and then the plaintiff states could file a new lawsuit as soon as Trump sends his apportionment results to Congress. Under this alternative outcome, Trump would win a temporary victory, but Trump\u2019s policy would still most likely fall victim to future litigation. Kavanaugh and Barrett also appeared to entertain a third possibility. The Court could strike down the categorical exclusion of undocumented immigrants laid out in Trump\u2019s July memorandum, but they could also permit Trump to issue a new memorandum that might exclude certain subcategories of undocumented immigrants (such as people currently in immigration detention). The plaintiff states could then file a new lawsuit challenging the legality of that new memorandum. In any event, it appears unlikely that Trump\u2019s original policy will stand. There appear to be at least five Supreme Court members \u2014 and potentially more than five \u2014 who think that Trump does not have the power to categorically exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count. The open question is whether the Court will decide this case quickly, or whether they will string this case out, potentially raising a cloud of uncertainty over the apportionment process for months or more. Such a cloud could have significant costs, as it will cut into the time that states need to use to draw new congressional maps using the new census data. But, at the very least, Trump\u2019s unconstitutional policy looks likely to fall \u2014 eventually.",

    "article_text": "Ajit Pai, Trump\u2019s FCC chair who repealed net neutrality, is leaving on January 20 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Ajit Pai has announced that he will leave the agency on January 20, when Joe Biden is sworn in as president. This gives Biden at least one commissioner slot to fill on his first day in office and, should that choice be confirmed, a Democrat majority to fulfill his vision of what the FCC should be and do for the next four years. Pai\u2019s controversial tenure as FCC chair has been marked by business-friendly deregulation that helped media conglomerates get even bigger while doing little for lower-income people who couldn\u2019t afford internet access \u2014 which has become an even more essential service during the pandemic. Pai also awarded billions of dollars in subsidies to broadband companies for providing internet access to remote locations, an investment of public dollars to close the digital divide that red state lawmakers found especially beneficial. \u201cIt has been the honor of a lifetime to serve at the Federal Communications Commission, including as Chairman of the FCC over the past four years,\u201d Pai said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to President Trump for giving me the opportunity to lead the agency in 2017, to President Obama for appointing me as a Commissioner in 2012, and to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the Senate for twice confirming me. To be the first Asian-American to chair the FCC has been a particular privilege. As I often say: only in America.\u201d \u201cWhile we did not always agree on policy matters, I always valued our shared commitment to public service,\u201d Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic FCC commissioner who is likely to become the acting chair when Biden takes office, said in a statement. Geoffrey Starks, the other Democrat on the commission, issued a similar if slightly less formal statement: \u201cChairman Pai and I may disagree on many policy issues, but we are in full agreement about two things: the outstanding quality of the FCC\u2019s staff and the tremendous abilities of Patrick Mahomes.\u201d Pai, a Republican, joined the FCC after working for Verizon, a fact he used to gleefully troll his Democratic colleagues who were concerned about Pai\u2019s ties to the company. And since he\u2019d been granted a second five-year term by President Trump in 2017, Pai could have stayed on as a commissioner until that term expired, but it\u2019s customary for chairs to leave the agency when a new administration comes in. The FCC is considered to be an independent agency with five commissioners (no more than three of whom can be from one political party) who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.  Under Pai, the FCC set about deregulating the industries under its purview as much as possible and reversing landmark Obama-era decisions. The net neutrality repeal is probably the most well-known example of both. During the Obama years, the FCC reclassified internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act, giving the agency more authority over them and forcing ISPs to treat all internet traffic the same. That would mean, for instance, that ISPs couldn\u2019t charge more for certain types of traffic or restrict access to certain websites. Pai was a vocal opponent of this policy as a commissioner under Obama, and repealed it as soon as he possibly could after taking over as chair.  Pai\u2019s reasoning was that such regulations would hamper investment and growth in a burgeoning industry (whether or not the internet can still be considered a burgeoning industry is up for debate). Pai called for a \u201clight touch framework,\u201d akin to the Clinton administration\u2019s approach from decades earlier (when the internet truly was a burgeoning industry).  This light-touch framework gave the FCC little recourse when the pandemic hit. The crisis left millions of Americans to rely on the internet more than ever, but they had fewer protections from exploitive rate increases or sudden service cuts. Pai\u2019s initiatives to reduce fraud in the agency\u2019s universal lifeline service, which subsidizes phone and internet for lower-income people, made it harder for people who actually needed it to qualify for and stay in the program, and his actions reduced the number of companies that could provide it. The $9.25 internet service subsidy also didn\u2019t cover the cost of most people\u2019s vastly increased data needs. Pai\u2019s solutions to these problems included asking broadband companies not to cut off subscribers who couldn\u2019t pay their bills during the first few months of the pandemic, and to pause lifeline service de-enrollment temporarily. However, Pai refused to extend the E-Rate program, which gives educational institutions heavily discounted internet and telecommunications services, to the private homes that became classrooms when the pandemic shut schools and libraries down. One of Pai\u2019s last acts for the agency will likely be his attempt to use Title II to assert the FCC\u2019s authority over internet service providers, platforms, and sites by \u201cclarifying\u201d Section 230, which gives those services immunity from liability for user content while still allowing internet companies to moderate that content as they see fit. For example: If someone posts something defamatory about you on Facebook, you can sue that user but you can\u2019t sue Facebook. Ironically, this is the opposite of a light-touch framework, the legal justification for which rests on having a Title II authority over internet services that Pai decidedly didn\u2019t want and worked hard to remove. But Section 230 was a pet cause of President Trump, especially as social media platforms increasingly cracked down on accounts that spread misinformation. Trump was enraged, for instance, when his election-related tweets and Facebook posts were labeled with fact-checks. Conservatives have increasingly asserted that tech companies are biased against certain political viewpoints, although studies have shown that social media actually amplifies and spreads conservative content far more than liberal content. Trump issued an executive order in May asking the FCC to dictate what content platforms could moderate and how, in order to keep their Section 230 protections. In October, Pai issued a statement saying the FCC would do as Trump asked. With Biden\u2019s election, it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely this will happen. Pai\u2019s business-friendly FCC also tried to \u201cstrengthen local voices\u201d and modernize media ownership rules by increasing how many television and radio stations one company may own and allowing them to own different media outlets in the same market. Some of these rules were struck down in court.  Meanwhile, a proposed merger between conservative local television provider Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tribune Media Company, which would have put Sinclair stations in roughly 70 percent of American homes, fell apart when Sinclair lied about its plans to sell off stations in order to comply with FCC ownership regulations. Pai was an initial proponent of the Sinclair takeover \u2014 to the extent that he was investigated for showing preferential treatment to the company (he was cleared) \u2014 but would ultimately defy Trump and vote to block the merger. Sinclair ended up with a record $48 million fine from the FCC. Tribune\u2019s stations were sold to a different company, Nexstar, which then became the largest television station owner in the country. Pai\u2019s FCC also approved the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, which decreased the number of major American wireless carriers from four to three. Pai said the deal would speed up the rollout of 5G. He also took a hands-off approach to the Time Warner/AT&T merger, saying the FCC didn\u2019t need to review or approve it because it didn\u2019t involve the transfer of airwave licenses, effectively clearing the way for the massive media conglomerate despite the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust concerns. While Pai\u2019s FCC may not have done much for urban and lower-income Americans, it did provide billions in funding for access to broadband in rural and tribal communities and \u2014 despite delays and interagency fights \u2014 eventually begin to expand 5G service across the country.  With Pai\u2019s departure and Republican commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly\u2019s term expiring at the end of the year, Biden will either begin his presidency with a 2-1 Democrat majority FCC or an FCC split along party lines. That depends on if Trump\u2019s nominee to replace O\u2019Rielly, Nathan Simington, is confirmed. Simington is seen as a major proponent of Trump\u2019s Section 230 executive order and didn\u2019t seem to be popular among Senate Democrats in his November confirmation hearing. Some Republicans have committed to voting for him, but a date for the vote has not yet been scheduled, and there isn\u2019t much time left. Should Simington not be confirmed, Trump appointee Brendan Carr would be left as the sole Republican commissioner on a three-person panel. Carr\u2019s statement about Pai\u2019s departure was significantly longer and more detailed than the other commissioners\u2019, saying that Pai \u201ccares deeply about the digital divide,\u201d thanking him for his \u201ccourageous and principled service to the country,\u201d and saying he would \u201cleave behind an [unparalleled] record of accomplishments \u2014 one that would not even fit in his oversized coffee mug.\u201d Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

    "article_text": "Arizona legislature closes as Trump lawyers push for special session to pick electors Trump campaign senior legal adviser\u00a0Jenna Ellis blasted Arizona's\u00a0speaker of the House on Sunday night after the state legislature closed following news that her colleague Rudy Giuliani tested positive for coronavirus days after speaking to Arizona state lawmakers about\u00a0allegations of election fraud. The Arizona legislature closed for the coming week after Giuliani and Ellis held an 11-hour hearing with a panel of Republican state lawmakers last week, the Arizona Capitol Times reported. Lawmakers will be forced to cancel some partially remote interim committee meetings, according to the Arizona Capitol Times. GIULIANI: PUSH FOR LEGISLATURES TO PICK ELECTORS IS 'FURTHEST ALONG' IN GEORGIA Ellis' criticism of House Speaker Rusty Bowers comes as President Donald\u00a0Trump's allies in the state are pushing for the Arizona legislature to overhaul how the state's electors are chosen and recall Arizona's certification of the election. \"Absolutely unnecessary. Call [Speaker] Rusty Bowers in AZ and tell him not to use COVID as an EXCUSE!!\" Ellis wrote on Twitter. The Trump legal team's efforts to urge state lawmakers to override the results of the\u00a0election\u00a0and appoint their own electors is \"furthest along\" in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0with other efforts in Arizona and Michigan, Giuliani told \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d RUDY GIULIANI TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS It's unclear how or when Giuliani contracted the virus. \"Mayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement.\u00a0\"The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return.\" Before Giuliani's coronavirus diagnosis, Bowers signaled an opposition to convening the state legislature to change Arizona elector law, saying in a statement that the Trump legal team offered \"only theories, not proof\" of widespread election fraud. \"Even if such evidence existed, the Arizona Legislature simply couldn\u2019t do what is being asked. Under our state\u2019s constitution, the Legislature can act only when it is in session, and the Legislature could call itself into a special session only with the support of a bipartisan supermajority of its members. That won\u2019t materialize,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"For decades, Arizona law has required that the voters elect the state\u2019s electors on Election Day\u2014this year, on November 3rd,\" Bowers continued. \"And under a law the Republican-led Legislature passed just three years ago, the state\u2019s electors are required to cast their votes for the candidates who received the most votes in the official statewide election canvass.\"",

    "article_text": "Mark Jan. 3 on your calendar Mark Jan.\u00a03, 2021 on your calendar. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,\u00a0indicates the new\u00a0117th Congress is likely to begin at noon on Jan.\u00a03 \u2013 even though it falls on a Sunday. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution mandates that Congress begin at that day and time. But\u00a0the Constitution offers Congress the option to change the start date \u2013 if it can pass a law. Congress has done so many times in recent years, especially if Jan.\u00a03 falls on a Sunday like it does in 2021. But Jan.\u00a03 is more likely this time around for a host of reasons. The first question is whether Congress can or wants to approve a bill to move the date \u2013 although Hoyer did leave open the possibility of beginning the 117th Congress on Jan.\u00a04 or 5. Moreover, congressional Democrats want as tight a window as possible to end the current\u00a0116th Congress \u2013 and then begin the new Congress\u00a0immediately\u00a0in January. Before starting the new Congress, the current (old) Congress must adjourn sine die\u00a0(pronounced sy-nee DIE). That\u2019s Latin for saying the current session ends \u201cwithout a date to resume.\u201d Congress could conceivably adjourn the 116th Congress sometime in December. But that presents President Trump with a wide berth to prospectively make a recess appointment to the federal courts. The Constitution requires Senate confirmation of executive and judicial branch appointees. But Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution allows the president to fill open posts when Congress is out of session or \u201cadjourned.\u201d Official Washington colloquially refers to such a maneuver as a \u201crecess appointment.\u201d But frankly, everyone should probably call it an \u201cadjournment appointment.\u201d A congressional \u201crecess\u201d is parliamentarily different from an \u201cadjournment\u201d on Capitol Hill. THE ONLY THING THE PANDEMIC DIDN'T CHANGE If the House and Senate were adjourned sine die\u00a0for the 117th Congress, Trump has an opportunity to short-circuit the confirmation process and make a recess appointment.\u00a0Thus, Democrats want to block the president from that option. The Constitution requires both the House and Senate agree to adjourn. Otherwise, the bodies must huddle for at least a few moments at three-day intervals. But the Democratically controlled House wouldn\u2019t let the Senate get away with adjourning. So\u00a0Congress likely won\u2019t adjourn sine die\u00a0until 11:59:59 a.m. ET\u00a0on Jan.\u00a03 \u2013 the last possible moment it can remain in session. This hermetically seals the aperture between the end of the 116th and the constitutionally mandated start of the 117th Congress: Jan.\u00a03 at noon ET. Moreover, there is another scenario on the table, which concerns lots of Democrats and some Republicans: a possible veto of the annual defense policy bill. Trump has threatened to veto the measure. Trump opposes language in the bill to change the names of military bases titled after Confederates. And\u00a0the president demanded that lawmakers include an extraneous provision in the package to terminate Section 230, which is\u00a0shorthand for a portion of telecommunication law that shields Big Tech firms from liability. Regardless, the House and Senate both appear to have the votes to override the president on that issue. CORONAVIRUS RISKS OF SWEARING IN MEANS HOUSE HAS A LOT TO FIGURE OUT The House approved the original version of the defense bill on July 21, 295-125. The Senate followed suit on July 23, passing the bill 86-14. Successful veto overrides require a two-thirds vote. Both the House and Senate demonstrated they could meet the two-thirds threshold to override the president. The House figure is a little close. The House is currently comprised of 431 members. That means 288 members would have to vote to override. But the Senate number is well above two-thirds (67). That said, the final version of the bill is a little different. And\u00a0votes on original versions of legislation don\u2019t always translate to the final measure \u2013 let alone a potential veto override attempt. Trump has vetoed eight measures during his time in office. Congress has never overridden one of his vetoes. Successful veto overrides are rare. There have only been 111 in American history. The last successful veto override came in September\u00a02016. The House and Senate overrode President Barack Obama\u2019s veto of a bill to allow the families of victims from the 9/11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. On its face, it would appear the House and Senate have the votes to override Trump if he vetoes the defense measure. But it\u2019s apparent to Fox that some GOPers still fear retaliation from\u00a0Trump if they\u00a0cross\u00a0them. The president tore into Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.,\u00a0on Twitter late last week for declining to add language to repeal Section 230. Inhofe characterized it as a poison pill that could torpedo the entire measure. FORMER SEN. PAUL SARBANES OF MARYLAND DEAD AT 87 Some GOPers won\u2019t cross the president on this issue. Especially if he will continue to hammer them \u2013\u00a0as Trump prospectively runs for president again over the next four years. Congressional Republicans still fear the president speaking out against them, tweeting about them and maybe engineering primary challenges. Starting the new Congress on Jan.\u00a03 may help Congress get around a threatened veto \u2013 if lawmakers pass the defense bill soon. However, if Congress passes the defense bill too close to the end of the 116th Congress, it\u2019s possible Trump could conceivably use his \u201cpocket veto\u201d to dismiss the defense bill. Pocket vetoes are extremely rare and require a unique set of parliamentary circumstances for the president to even have the option. But one could exist in these circumstances. A \u201cregular\u201d veto is just that. Congress passes a bill. Sends it to the White House. And the president, rather than signing the bill, vetoes it. However, the \u201cpocket\u201d veto option is available to the president if Congress sends him a bill close to the end of a congressional session. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution allows the president to essentially \u201cpocket veto\u201d a bill if he receives it\u00a0and doesn\u2019t return it to Congress (with his veto) \u201cwithin ten days (Sundays excepted).\u201d Here\u2019s how this pertains to the end of the 116th Congress and the \u201cpocket veto\u201d: Congress could pass the final version of the defense bill and send it to the president. If lawmakers dispatch the paperwork to the White House too close to the end of the 116th Congress (remember, the 10\u00a0days, Sundays excluded business from Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution), the president can sidestep the prospect of an override effort by simply holding onto the defense bill. He doesn\u2019t have to sign it. He doesn\u2019t have to veto it. He just holds it in his pocket (hence, the term) until the current session of Congress expires. If Congress adjourns sine die and there is no action by the president on the bill, he has effectively vetoed the measure. Congress has no recourse. The legislation dissolves into thin air. It must start with a new bill in the new Congress. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thus, if House and Senate leaders really want to avoid the possibility of a pocket veto, they need to pass the defense bill as soon as possible \u2013 and wait as long as possible to adjourn the 116th Congress. Therefore, ending the present Congress at a later date (Jan.\u00a03) could help Congress strip Trump of the opportunity to use a pocket veto for the defense bill.",

    "article_text": "Trump urges Georgia to vote in Senate runoffs at rally, still hits 'rigged' election With the Republican majority on the line in Georgia's Senate runoffs, President Trump returned\u00a0to the campaign trail Saturday for the first time since last month\u2019s presidential election. Along with first lady Melania Trump, he gave a night rally in Valdosta, Ga., for Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Trump described to the crowd how he saw the stakes\u00a0in the twin Senate runoffs.\u00a0 \"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or free country. Socialism is just the beginning for these people. They want to\u00a0go into a communistic form of government,\" the president continued.\u00a0 Trump said that Perdue's opponent, Jon Ossoff, and Loeffler's opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are the \"two most extreme, far-left, liberal candidates in history.\"\u00a0 Trump implored Georgians to vote, while still sowing distrust in the state's handling of elections.\u00a0 \"You must go vote, vote early. They cheated, they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. They're going to try and rig this election too.\" Trump then hit the state's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"Your governor could stop it very easily, if he knew what the hell he was doing.\" He said that Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger were \"afraid of Stacey Abrams,\" the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist.\u00a0 \"If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I'd go to Florida...but you can't ever accept what they steal and rig and rob. You can't accept it,\" Trump continued.\u00a0 Of the 2024 presidential election, Trump said, \"Hopefully, I\u00a0won't have to be a candidate.\" Just after the rally, the president took to Twitter to urge Georgians to register to vote before Monday, Dec. 12, and to request an absentee ballot before 12/31.\u00a0 \"The answer to the Democrat voter fraud is not to stay at home - that\u2019s what Pelosi and Schumer want you to do. If you want revenge on the Democrats for their efforts to steal the Presidential election, where we are fighting hard, you have to show up and vote in RECORD numbers!\" he added.\u00a0 Crowds of supporters lined up for hours\u00a0to attend the rally. Some even camped overnight, despite temperatures dropping to the mid-30s. As the\u00a0mostly maskless supporters stood in line waiting for temperature checks, a chant broke out: \"Stop the steal.\"\u00a0 On the eve of Trump\u2019s trip, Vice President Mike Pence -- in the Peach State for the second time since the kickoff of the twin Senate showdowns -- emphasized: \u201cPresident Trump and I need David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.\u201d BIDEN, OBAMA, PENCE, AND TRUMP WEIGH IN ON GEORGIA RUNOFFS Loeffler and Perdue are the\u00a0GOP candidates in the Jan. 5 elections, which will determine if Republicans hold the chamber, or if\u00a0Democrats control both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. AD SPENDING IN GEORGIA'S TWIN RUNOFF ELECTIONS SKYROCKETS \u00a0 Republicans desperately need Trump supporters to return to the polls a month from now, despite unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election. The balance of power for the next Senate coming out of last month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That\u00a0means\u00a0Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoffs to make it a 50-50 split Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a\u00a0razor-thin majority in the chamber. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS SPUR PROBE INTO THIRD-PARTY GROUPS TRYING TO REGISTER OUT-OF-STATE VOTERS In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate garners\u00a050% of the vote, Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trailed by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock won nearly 33% of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that Republicans are united in this fight against Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the re-election arm of the Senate GOP.\u00a0 \u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9, but with two very consequential runoffs, turnout is critical.\u201d Hunt told Fox News that \u201cthe president\u2019s visit is going to be an event that energizes and mobilizes our Republican voters.\u201d The visit comes on the eve of Sunday\u2019s debate between Loeffler and Warnock, which will be\u00a0carried live nationally on Fox News. Trump continues to fight the results of the presidential contest in Georgia, a once solidly red state that\u2019s turned into a crucial battleground in recent years. President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by roughly 12,000 votes in last month\u2019s election. The results were backed up by a manual recount mandated by state officials. A second recount requested by the president, completed Friday, didn\u2019t alter the final result \u2013 and the election results were cerrtified. But as Biden prepares to take office, Trump has continued his assault\u00a0on the election. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE GEORGIA RUNOFFS The president this week tweeted or retweeted baseless charges of voter fraud in Georgia, and he\u2019s repeatedly attacked\u00a0Kemp and\u00a0 Raffensperger, who are both Trump supporters, for their refusal to\u00a0reverse the election results.  Conspiratorial claims by pro-Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood this week further\u00a0roiled the waters. They filed lawsuits seeking to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. At a rally Wednesday, they went further, urging\u00a0GOP voters to not support Perdue and Loeffler, charging that the senators have not been supportive enough of Trump's\u00a0efforts to overturn the election. \u201cThey have not earned your vote. Don\u2019t you give it to them,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWhy would you go back and vote in another rigged election, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d That\u2019s got plenty of Republicans in Georgia pushing back. Former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who represented Georgia in Congress for decades, tweeted this week:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive. Every Georgia conservative who cares about America MUST vote in the runoff.\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official and a Republican, predicted that voter fraud allegations\u00a0by Trump and his allies will\u00a0drive down GOP turnout in the Senate runoffs. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no way that it can\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN in an interview this week. On Friday, as his legal team filed a new lawsuit in Georgia, Trump tied the runoffs to his push to reverse the state\u2019s presidential election results as he once again demanded a signature audit of ballots. \u201cThe best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win,\u201d the president claimed. And he argued that \u201cSpirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE!\u201d But ahead of the president\u2019s trip, a dozen and a half leading Georgia Republicans issued a statement urging that the focus turn from attacks over the Nov. 3 results to the Senate runoffs. \u201cWe have watched with increasing concern as the debate surrounding the state\u2019s electoral\u00a0system has made some within our Party consider whether voting in the coming run-off election\u00a0matters, \" the statement read.\u00a0\u00a0\"We say today, without equivocation, that without every vote cast for President Trump\u00a0and all our Republican candidates on November 3 also being cast in the U.S. Senate runoffs, the\u00a0trajectory of our State and Nation will be irreparably altered on January 5th.\u00a0Now is the time to unite our Party and win these U.S. Senate seats.\" Among those signing the statement were former Republican Sens.\u00a0Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Mack Mattingly, and former GOP Gov.

If we win Georgia, everything else falls in place!\u201d But the president\u2019s Saturday comments did not line up with what Kemp reportedly told Trump. \u201cAs I told the President this morning, I\u2019ve publicly called for a signature audit three times (11/20, 11/24, 12/3) to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia,\u201d Kemp fired back on Twitter, directly responding to Trump\u2019s tweet. Trump later responded asking that the governor call for a \"special session of the legislature,\" calling the governing body together outside of the normal session periods. \"But you never got the signature verification! Your people are refusing to do what you ask,\" Trump replied on twitter.\u00a0\"What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.\" Georgia officials\u00a0completed a hand recount of the votes along with an additional machine-based recount, both of which found\u00a0President-elect Joe Biden had won Georgia. But even if Trump did win Georgia, it would not be enough for reelection. Biden\u00a0already secured 279 Electoral College votes after California certified its results Friday. There still are three other\u00a0states -- Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey \u2013 that Biden won but that have not yet certified votes. NEVADA GOP VOWS APPEAL AFTER JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u2019S LATEST SUIT Biden is expected to be elected with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump\u2019s 232 votes. Friday, the Trump campaign filed another lawsuit in Georgia requesting the state courts\u00a0\u201corder a new election to be conducted in the presidential race,\u201d alleging \u201ctens of thousands of illegal votes.\u201d The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team has\u00a0issued dozens of lawsuits in several states claiming voter and election fraud \u2013 none of which have held up. \u201cWhat was filed today clearly documents that there are literally tens of thousands of illegal votes that were cast, counted, and included in the tabulations the Secretary of State is preparing to certify,\u201d Ray S. Smith III, attorney for the Trump campaign, said in the statement Friday.\u00a0\u201cThe Secretary of State has orchestrated the worst excuse for an election in Georgia history.\u201d \u201cWe are asking the Court to vacate the certification of the presidential election and to order a new statewide election for president,\u201d Smith added. Kemp is not the only Republican pushing back on Trump\u2019s repeated claims of fraud. Numerous investigations\u00a0have found no evidence of widespread fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, dismissed\u00a0accusations of election fraud due to lack of evidence, and condemned Trump\u2019s \u201cviolent rhetoric.\u201d \u201cEven after this office's request that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning the states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out \u2018expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,\u2019\u201d Raffensperger said earlier this week during a press conference, reported Reuters.

Steve Sisolak, essentially securing the state\u2019s six Electoral College votes for Biden. MIRANDA DEVINE CALLS NEVADA 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REVIEW 'GOOD NEWS' Trump campaign attorney Jesse Binnall, told Judge James Russell that 1,506 votes received in the general election came from deceased voters, according to KLAS-TV of Las Vegas. Binnall also alleged that 42,284 voters\u00a0voted twice, roughly 20,000 voters were found to have voted without a Nevada mailing address and 2,468 voters had changed their address to another state. Trump\u2019s legal team said they focused on Nevada\u2019s election law that\u00a0allows mail-in ballots to be sent to every individual without the ballot having first been requested \u2013 a practice\u00a0that several states carried out\u00a0amid the coronavirus pandemic. Just prior to the Thursday hearing, the Nevada GOP posted a video on Twitter of 20 binders they said contained evidence supporting their claims. \"We have testimony from multiple witnesses reporting that the usb drives used in the election would show that vote tallies changed overnight,\u201d the group said on Twitter. \u00a0\u201cThat means in the dead of night, votes would appear or disappear on these voting machines during early voting and Election Day.\" Binnall alleged that Clark County\u00a0lacked proper security and scrutiny over their voting machines. \u201cIn the dead of night, votes appeared and votes reappeared without explanation, and there is no good explanation,\u201d Binnall said according to the local news outlet. But Russell pushed back on this point, noting that there is no way to tell who voted for whom, and asked\u00a0how this information changes the outcome of the election. \u201cIn a court of law it\u2019s evidence that counts, not tweets or social media bluster, not hearsay or speculation, it\u2019s evidence and that\u2019s what\u2019s missing in the record before the court,\u201d attorney Kevin Hamilton, representing the Democrats, said.

Fox News has also learned that the entities, which include the campaign, the RNC, Trump Victory, and Trump Make America Great Again Committee, will file with the Federal Election Commission Thursday for the reporting period of Oct. 15 to Nov. 23, when they raised a total of $495\u00a0million. RNC VOWS TO SPEND AT LEAST $20 MILLION IN GEORGIA AHEAD OF JAN. 5 SENATE RUNOFFS The Save America PAC was formed just after Election Day, and its fundraising is\u00a0not included in that total of $495\u00a0million. A source close to the president told Fox News that the massive $207.5 million raised since Election Day \"reaffirms that POTUS is the big dog in the Republican Party.\"\u00a0 The source added that the numbers are still being done jointly with the RNC, showing that \"joint partnership remains strong.\"\u00a0 \u201cThese tremendous fundraising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party, and that his supporters are dedicated to fighting for the rightful, legal outcome of the 2020 general election,\u201d Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told Fox News. \u201cIt also positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022,\u201d Stepien added. The massive post-Election Day fundraising came amid legal challenges mounted by the Trump campaign in key battleground states across the nation, where President-elect Joe Biden led by a razor-thin margin. The Trump campaign has been alleging a widespread conspiracy to dump millions of illegal votes into the system, but has not provided substantial evidence to support those claims. The campaign\u2019s legal effort, led by Rudy Giuliani, has, in large part, been focused on Republican poll watchers being blocked from viewing vote counting at polling sites in some locations. Those claims have been dismissed\u00a0even by Republican-appointed judges, who have said the cases lack evidence. Election officials in many of those states have certified Biden\u2019s victory. The president, this week, despite refusing to concede to Biden, hinted that he may launch a 2024 campaign to return to the White House. \"It's been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I'll see you in four years,\"\u00a0the president told supporters on Tuesday night at a White House holiday party for members of the Republican National Committee. Two GOP sources who attended the function confirmed the president's comments to Fox News. Until now, Trump has remained quiet about the possibility of running to reclaim the White House in 2024. \"I don't want to talk to 2024 yet,\"\u00a0the president told reporters on Thanksgiving. But behind closed doors, Trump has told advisers that he wants to run again in four years\u00a0and\u00a0could potentially announce his bid before or even during Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, sources told Fox News. The Save America PAC allows Trump to continue to fundraise and maintain his hold on\u00a0the Republican Party even after he departs the White House. Trump campaign\u00a0communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News last month\u00a0that \u201cthe president always planned to do this, win or lose, so he can support candidates and issues he cares about, such as combating voter fraud.\u201d TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL BID Meanwhile, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News that \u201cthe American people know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d \u201cThanks to our incredible supporters, we\u2019ve been fighting tooth and nail to uphold election integrity across the country and defend our Senate Republicans in Georgia,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cWe are investing millions to push back against the Democrats\u2019 unprecedented power grab and drive a massive Get Out The Vote operation in the Peach State.\u201d She added: \u201cThe work we are doing today is critical to ensuring a better tomorrow for all Americans.\u201d McDaniel and Trump are slated to campaign in Georgia on Saturday for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler ahead of the Jan. 5 runoffs.\u00a0 Fox News reported earlier this week that the RNC had committed to spending at least $20 million in Georgia in support of Perdue and Loeffler.\u00a0 The current balance of power for the next Senate coming out of this month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoff elections to make it a 50-50 Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber. In Georgia, state law dictates a runoff if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote. Last month, GOP\u00a0Sen.\u00a0David Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. His Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trailed by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, appointed Republican\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Kelly Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. The Democratic candidate in the runoff,\u00a0Rev. Raphael Warnock, won nearly 33% of the vote in the first round. Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr said this week that the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press.

    "article_text": "Trump's legacy on courts still building in waning days of presidency The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote next week on the nominee to fill the appeals court seat vacated by new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0as well as voting on whether to send three other lower trial court nominees to the Senate floor \u2014 which could further cement President Trump\u2019s reshaping of the federal judiciary before he leaves office. This comes to the chagrin of Democrats who insist Republicans are violating tradition by continuing to confirm judges despite a Joe Biden victory in the presidential race. After hearings on nominees before the Thanksgiving recess, the committee is scheduled to\u00a0vote Dec. 10 on the nomination of Thomas L. Kirsch II to serve on the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, replacing Barrett. Kirsch is currently the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. The committee had been expected to vote Thursday, but ultimately held over the nominations to next week. There are only three current and known future vacancies on appeals courts, according to the Judicial Crisis Network, which monitors judicial nominations. Meanwhile, there are 59 current or known future vacancies on district and specialty courts, with 35 pending nominations. \u201cPeople focus less on district courts because they decide cases rather than make legal precedent,\u201d Curt Levey, president of the Committee for Justice, told Fox News. \u201cBut we have seen rogue district judges impose national injunctions during the Trump administration. They can make it difficult for a president and slow the administration of justice. What district courts do matter. A Trump-appointed district judge will be very different from a Biden-appointed district judge.\u201d JONATHAN TURLEY: GUN RIGHTS CASE TAILOR-MADE FOR JUSTICE BARRETT, SUPREME COURT. HERE'S WHY The Judiciary Committee will also vote Thursday on the nominations of Charles Edward Atchley Jr. and Katherine A. Crytzer, both to be judges for the Eastern District of Tennessee; on the nomination of Joseph Dawson III to be a judge for the District of South Carolina and for Zachary N. Somers to be a judge for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. On Nov. 13, Trump announced his intent to nominate Ra\u00fal M. Arias-Marxuach to be a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Arias-Marxuach is currently a district judge for the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico. He is still awaiting a hearing. Trump\u2019s term expires on Jan. 20, 2021, but he is contesting the outcome of the Nov. 3 election in several states, even as Biden has been certified the winner in key battleground states. Still, with one term in office, Trump has already appointed more judges than his immediate predecessors who served two terms. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Taylor B. McNeel to be a judge for the Southern District of Mississippi and\u00a0J. Philip\u00a0Calabrese to be a judge for the Northern District of Ohio\u00a0while four other lower court nominees are pending a Senate floor vote. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR PASSES ON BIDEN CABINET OFFER, SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS These recent confirmations mean a total of 229 Trump-appointed judges in just one term \u2014 so far, according to Courthouse News Service. Three of those appointments \u2014 Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 were to the U.S. Supreme Court. That\u2019s compared to Presidents Barack Obama, who managed to get a total of 160 judicial nominees over two terms, George W. Bush, who got a total of 204 nominees confirmed in eight years, and Bill Clinton, who scored 203 judicial appointments over two terms. Also falling short of Trump\u2019s single term \u2014 Obama, Clinton and Bush each appointed two Supreme Court justices. \u201cThe most important thing Trump did in judicial nominations is break free from the traditional Republican method of picking jurists,\u201d J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department lawyer, now president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News. \u201cTrump picked conservatives who have battle scars and who have fought the fight.

    "article_text": "Trump says if he's right about election fraud, 'Biden can't be president' President Trump is once again charging that last month\u2019s presidential election was rigged and rampant with fraud. In an address posted on his Twitter and Facebook pages that the president described as possibly \u201cthe most important speech, I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Trump charged that \u201clots of bad things happened\u201d during the election. WHISTLEBLOWERS SHARE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF ALLEGED ELECTION IRREGULARITIES And he argued that\u00a0\"if we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can't be president. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. We're talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before.\" Taking aim again at the surge in absentee balloting and early voting due to health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, the president emphasized that \u201cwe used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days, weeks and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time.\u201d \"The mail and voting scam is the latest part of their four-year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election. And it's been like living in hell,\" Trump argued. TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS And the president vowed that he\u2019s \u201cdetermined to protect our election system,\u201d which he claimed, \u201cis now under coordinated assault and siege.\u201d Twitter, as it has for numerous Trump tweets regarding charges of election fraud, added a disclaimer that said \u201cThis claim about election fraud is disputed.\u201d And Facebook noted that \u201cJoe Biden is the projected winner of the US Presidential election.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, came one day after Attorney General William Barr said in an interview with the Associated Press that following inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u00a0\u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d And it comes as a growing number of members of his own party have broken with Trump over his claims of voter fraud. The president has refused to concede to Biden, more than three and a half weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news organizations projected that the former vice president would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect.  Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battleground states, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. And recounts requested by Trump in Georgia and Wisconsin, two of the six key battleground states that Biden narrowly edged Trump and which the president has contested, have to date failed to alter Biden's victories. On Sunday, in his first interview since the election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS FROM FOX NEWS \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team. In his speech on Wednesday, the president said that \u201cwe are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted.\u201d And he emphasized that his efforts are \u201cabout ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Kayleigh McEnany scolds Jennifer Rubin, Anderson Cooper for criticizing Trump's push to keep kids in school White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany name-dropped Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday when reminding reporters that liberals regularly bashed President Trump for wanting to keep schools open amid the coronavirus pandemic until Dr. Anthony Fauci recently declared that schools should remain open. McEnany quoted prominent Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and examples of liberals in power who disagreed with Trump on the issue. But, liberal journalists also have mocked Trump for wanting to keep schools open. FAUCI: 'CLOSE THE BARS, KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN' TO MITIGATE COMMUNITY SPREAD McEnany noted that Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin once declared that Trump wants to \u201ckill your kids\u201d by keeping them in school. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s responsible reporting,\u201d McEnany said. McEnany then turned her attention to Cooper, a\u00a0CNN anchor, who also condemned the idea of allowing children to learn inside an actual classroom. \u201cYou had Anderson Cooper saying that he actually doesn't care about kids at all, nor about the health of their teachers and parents,\u201d McEnany said. She then noted that Trump has \u201cfollowed the science\u201d all along when it came\u00a0to the polarizing topic. DE BLASIO TO REOPEN NYC SCHOOLS, SAYS HE HEARD PARENTS 'LOUD AND CLEAR' \u201cHe\u2019s also kept in mind, we have a Constitution, and he will be unashamed and always advocating for the science and the best interest of the children of this country,\u201d McEnany said before walking away from the podium and ending the briefing. Fauci on Sunday echoed Trump\u2019s long-standing position that kids should be in school whenever possible. \u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We say it, not being facetiously or having\u00a0a soundbite or anything, but you know: close the bars, keep the schools open, is what we really say,\" Fauci told Martha Raddatz on ABC News'\u00a0\"This Week.\" \"Obviously, you don't have one size fits all, but as I've said in the past, and as you accurately quoted me \u2013\u00a0the default position should be as best as possible, within reason, to keep the children in school and get them back to school.\" Fauci noted that the spread of COVID-19 between children was \"low,\" especially compared to other areas. Earlier this month, de Blasio ordered all public schools to move to total virtual learning,\u00a0a move that drew a sharp backlash\u00a0from parents across the city.\u00a0 Fox News\u2019 Peter Aitken contributed to this report.",

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday morning\u00a0and comes\u00a0after Wisconsin completed its partial recount \u2014 which maintained that Joe Biden won the presidential race in the state \u2014 and after Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers formally certified Biden\u2019s victory Monday night. The Trump campaign\u2019s Wisconsin legal team, led by former Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, told Fox News that while the recount in the state did not flip in President Trump\u2019s favor, it gave the campaign\u00a0the \u201cunique ability\u201d to examine ballots. \u201cExposing exactly how the election processes were abused in Wisconsin holds enormous value for this election beyond a victory for President Trump, but the fact is, our state\u2019s electoral votes likely won\u2019t change the overall outcome,\u201d Troupis told Fox News. \u201cRegardless, we\u2019re demonstrating that the results of this election unequivocally ought to be questioned.\u201d ARIZONA, WISCONSIN CERTIFY BIDEN AS ELECTION WINNER The legal team also said\u00a0the suit highlights \u201ca lack of transparency and credibility on part of local election officials and their willful disregard of the law on multiple occasions\u201d and added that the state\u2019s laws and processes gave it\u00a0the \u201cunique ability\u201d to \u201cillustrate this abuse with precision.\u201d Biden for President communications director Nate Evans told Fox News in a statement that the 'lawsuit is completely baseless and not rooted in facts on the ground.\" \"Joe Biden decisively won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes, and yesterday the Governor certified that result. The hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites targeted by this lawsuit did nothing wrong. They simply followed longstanding guidance from elections officials issued under the law,\" a statement said. \"These arguments to disenfranchise large groups of Wisconsin voters were resoundingly rejected by the Dane and Milwaukee County Boards of Canvassers during the recount process, frequently on a bipartisan basis.\" The Trump campaign claims\u00a0officials on the Wisconsin Election Commission and the City Clerks of Milwaukee and Madison \u201cwillfully disregarded the current statute and made conscious efforts to circumvent Wisconsin election law,\u201d resulting in tens of thousands of votes cast \u201cwell outside of the bounds of Wisconsin law.\u201d It also asserts\u00a0the law was violated \u201con several occasions\u201d through what it\u00a0described as altered-certification absentee ballot envelopes, a lack of required absentee ballot applications, unlawful claims of indefinite confinement\u00a0and voting events called \u201cDemocracy in the Park.\u201d Wisconsin law requires that written absentee ballot request forms must be submitted ahead of the voter casting their absentee ballot, but the Trump campaign claimed that election officials, instead, \u201caccepted ballots without the required absentee applications on file.\u201d TRUMP HASN'T CONCEDED, BUT HE'S BEEN SECRETLY CONSIDERING 2024 \u201cThe Wisconsin State Legislature has explicitly required an application,\u201d a Trump campaign official told Fox News, saying it is \u201cmandatory and any ballots without an application or with an incomplete application are not to be counted.\u201d The campaign said ballots cast without the initial absentee ballot applications on file \u201cmust be called into question.\u201d Next, the campaign pointed to Wisconsin law, which requires any ballots that are incorrectly filled out, missing information\u00a0or damaged to\u00a0be returned to the voter to correct and resubmit. But the lawsuit alleges municipal clerks were \u201cillegally altering ballot envelopes themselves.\u201d \u201cIn many instances, witness addresses were left off of the envelopes and clerks, using their own knowledge or searching in unknown databases, filled in the information themselves,\u201d a campaign official told Fox News. \u201cAccording to the statute, this is illegal.\u201d DISTRICT JUDGE HALTS 3 GEORGIA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA \u201cIf the certificate or envelope is missing a witness address, the ballot cannot be counted until the voter corrects the error \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d the official added. \u201cInstead, election officials decided to take the law into their own hands.\u201d The official added: \u201cThese ballots were fraudulently completed and counted, and the illegal ballots should not count toward the certified vote totals.\u201d The lawsuit also alleges voters were \u201cfraudulently allowed by election officials\u201d to circumvent voter ID laws by claiming absentee voting status that, under state law, was only to be used for voters who are \u201cindefinitely confined.\u201d The status of \u201cindefinite confinement\u201d in Wisconsin is intended for voters who are \u201cphysically ill, infirm, elderly or disabled\u201d and for those who are \u201cunable to vote in person under those terms.\u201d The campaign claimed that due to the \u201cconfusion and misinformation from Democratic election officials\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, many voters requested that status \u201ceven though they definitely were not confined.\u201d \u201cThis allowed voters abusing the status to vote without providing identification, as required by law,\u201d the official explained. HOWARD KURTZ: DEMOCRATS HAVE A RURAL AMERICA PROBLEM THAT'S HURTING THEM ON THE HILL The campaign said that in March, Democrat election officials \u201cfalsely told voters they could claim this status because of the pandemic\u201d but said that was \u201clater struck down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d The Trump campaign said that from 2016 to 2020, the number of indefinitely confined voters increased \u201cdramatically\u201d \u2014 nearly 600% in Dane County and about 500% in Milwaukee County. The lawsuit also will claim that clerks \u201cdid not do their due diligence to remove voters fraudulently claiming\u201d that status and \u201cmade no good faith effort to check publicly available information and remove indefinite confinement permissions from illegitimate voters.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that anyone who cast a ballot under the terms of indefinite confinement without meeting that criteria \u201cdid so fraudulently,\u201d and therefore, their \u201cillegal ballots must not be counted.\u201d Meanwhile, the campaign also alleged that the city of Madison created \u201cunlawful polling locations at over 200 locations throughout the city\u2019s Democracy in the Park voting events\u201d and said the ballots accepted at the events \u201cwere illegally cast.\u201d The campaign claimed\u00a0the polling locations were held outside of the county\u2019s \u201capproved polling locations and did not follow the state\u2019s strict absentee voting requirements.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s truly alarming about these events is that not only did they not follow the law, but Joe Biden\u2019s campaign encouraged this unlawful voting,\u201d a campaign official told Fox News, claiming the Biden campaign \u201cadvertised these events as opportunities to vote, telling voters to bring their completed ballot to turn in or their incomplete ballot to have a so-called \u2018poll worker\u2019 serve as a witness before you fill it out and turn it in.\u201d \u201cThis highlights inappropriate coordination between the Biden campaign and the city\u2019s election officials,\u201d the official said, noting that voters \u201care not allowed to turn in their absentee ballots anywhere other than designated polling locations.\u201d A Trump campaign official told Fox News its\u00a0lawsuit is to ensure that \u201clegal voters are not being disenfranchised by ensuring only legal votes are counted,\u201d adding that Democrat election officials' \u201cmotive is clear.\u201d \u201cThey want Joe Biden to win at all costs, regardless of whether the votes for him are legal or illegal,\u201d the official said, adding that the \u201ccourt must do the right thing and remove the illegal ballots from the certified vote total.\u201d The Wisconsin Election Commission told Fox News that they do not comment on lawsuits.\u00a0Neither Evers\u00a0nor the Biden campaign immediately responded to Fox News' request for comment.\u00a0 The Trump campaign\u2019s Wisconsin legal team told Fox News it had more than 4,000 volunteers working throughout the recount in the state. The lawsuit comes after Evers certified Wisconsin\u2019s results for Biden. \u201cWith Governor Evers\u2019 premature certification, he is saying the President of the United States has no right to go to court in order to have illegal ballots examined,\u201d Troupis told Fox News. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying we have a frivolous lawsuit \u2014 he is saying we have no right to judicial review \u2014 that\u2019s another level of bad.\u201d Troupis added: \u201cThe idea that great law firms and great lawyers would not get involved in cases like this because they\u2019re afraid is the reason I took this case in the first instance.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years, representing plenty of Democrats and Republicans, and I will not back down when it comes to upholding the law or protecting the integrity of our elections,\u201d Troupis told Fox News. \u201cWe, as good lawyers, don\u2019t back down, and if we do, our republic is done.\u201d Trump has refused to concede to Biden, now\u00a0more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat him and become president-elect. The president\u2019s legal team, in other areas across the nation, filed a spate of lawsuits in many key battlegrounds\u00a0in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as the one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden\u2019s victories. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed\u00a0the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\u201d \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim\u00a0in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.",

    "article_text": "Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn Bourdeaux, only Democrat to flip seat, says party should talk to Trump supporters Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn\u00a0Bourdeaux fell just 433 votes shy of becoming a congresswoman in 2018 in the tightest House\u00a0race in the country. But two years later, the college professor and public policy expert mounted a comeback by beating GOP emergency room physician\u00a0Rich McCormick by more than 10,000 votes and becoming the first woman to represent Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Her win in\u00a0November in\u00a0suburban Atlanta was a\u00a0major bright spot for House Democrats who otherwise had a tough 2020 election by losing unexpected seats and shrinking their majority. Bourdeaux arrived in Washington, D.C., recently for congressional orientation as the only Democrat to flip a red seat in earnest. Bourdeaux said the key for Democrats having future success will be to\u00a0listen to non-Democrats\u00a0as well. \"We need to pay a lot of attention to the\u00a0diverse communities of this country,\" Bourdeaux\u00a0told Fox News in an interview in\u00a0Washington, \"and that diversity includes people who supported Trump and people who are\u00a0not in our camp. One of the things I did over and over was just sit and listen to people.\" REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' Democrats picked up two more open\u00a0House seats in North Carolina because of new congressional district maps. But\u00a0Bourdeaux remains the only Democrat to flip an existing red district blue. Meanwhile, Republicans flipped a dozen seats from blue to red and weakened the Democrats' majority. Bourdeaux credits her\u00a0win to putting in the work of building the Democratic Party infrastructure of registering voters, especially in the Asian American community, to the mobilizing efforts of\u00a0young organizers and meeting with people of all backgrounds. She said she visited mosques, synagogues and churches,\u00a0talked to the local Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce\u00a0and Black fraternities and sororities to brainstorm solutions on issues important to them. She focused her campaign on universal messages of improving health care, fighting the coronavirus\u00a0and getting people back to work and school. \"It's a combination of message and then work,\" Bourdeaux said of her success in a traditionally Republican area of Georgia.\u00a0 The 2020 election delivered mixed results, with Joe Biden winning the White House and Georgia -- the first time a Democrat carried the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992. But Democrats lost seats in the House, and Biden's only hope of having Democrats control the Senate is by winning twin runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT PLANS THANKSGIVING 'FUNERAL' FOR DEAD TURKEY IN DEFIANCE OF COLORADO GUIDELINES \"It was a double wave election where both sides really turned out in huge numbers,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. \"I don't know if there's anything clear except that we are a purple nation.\u00a0... We're just going to have to find a way to focus on the problem and then work together to find a solution.\u201d Top of her list is\u00a0solving the coronavirus crisis and\u00a0improving health care.\u00a0It's\u00a0unacceptable that so many middle-class families are priced out of buying health care and those with insurance still can't afford to pay for prescription drugs or cover\u00a0their medical bills, she said. Health care problems hit close to home. Her\u00a0parents' health care costs become so expensive, they drained their bank accounts and couldn't afford to\u00a0pay for their medications. Bourdeaux's mother cared for her sick father for 10 years\u00a0until both her parents passed away in 2017, she said. \"I have my own personal story. My\u00a0father was sick for a decade. My mother took care of him and all of their discretionary income was eaten up paying for his prescription medications,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. REP.-ELECT TONY GONZALES HELPS GOP HOLD TEXAS BORDER DISTRICT: 'MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN DREAM' In talking to a range of voters over the years, she saw that health care struggles are too common. \"I think everybody had a health care horror story,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said, relaying stories of maternity care and unexpected billing.\u00a0 \"I cannot believe we allow this to happen to us. And so those are the kind of things that we need to fix and ... I'm already talking to people about working in a bipartisan fashion.\" Growing up in Roanoke, Va., as the daughter of educators,\u00a0Bourdeaux earned admission to\u00a0Yale University where she got her\u00a0bachelor's degree\u00a0with the help of\u00a0grants and federal loans. She went on to receive a master's in public administration from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse University. Bourdeaux, 50, is an associate professor at Georgia State University teaching classes centered on\u00a0public service, policy\u00a0and budgeting. She's a wife and mother to an 8-year-old son. ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS \u2014 NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS She brings to Washington a deep policy expertise\u00a0that she wants to put to use to find bipartisan solutions, especially on health care. She previously\u00a0tackled legislative issues in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and was the\u00a0former director of the nonpartisan Georgia Senate Budget Office where she worked with both parties to balance the budget during the Great Recession.\u00a0 \"I had solved problems during the last\u00a0worst crisis this country had faced and I had done it\u00a0in\u00a0a bipartisan basis. I got the job done for people,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said.\u00a0 In contrast to the Democratic socialist wing of the party, Bourdeaux takes a more measured approach to health care, policing, free college tuition and more. She wants to improve the Affordable Care Act and add\u00a0a public option but doesn't back \"Medicare for all.\" She didn't run on the Green New Deal; instead, she talks of having a Marshall Plan level of investment in clean-energy jobs and building up a green transit system. \"I'm very interested in ... having a big infrastructure investment,\" Bourdeaux said. \"We need it anyway. If\u00a0you've driven through Atlanta, we have soul-sucking commutes and horrific traffic.\" Bourdeaux thinks police departments may actually need more funding, not less, to support better\u00a0training and community policing programs.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have never said defund the police,\" she said. \"That's just a made-up argument and it takes away from a very important conversation we need to be having about race.\" REP.-ELECT DIANA HARSHBARGER SAYS CONGRESS IS NO MATCH 'FOR A WOMAN WHO CAN MULTITASK' As a college professor, Bourdeaux understands firsthand the struggles students face trying to pay\u00a0for school but says families\u00a0need to have some skin in the game.\u00a0\"I believe in affordable. I don't know that I can get you to free.\" When she recently arrived in Washington, D.C., Bourdeaux\u00a0took stock of her\u00a0historic victory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's\u00a0an extraordinary honor to be here and to go step on the House floor where so many historic debates have taken place,\" Bourdeaux said.\u00a0\"I don't think you run for an office like that unless you really deeply believe in the country. You see the Capitol building and you're like: 'I\u00a0can't believe\u00a0I'm going to have the privilege of working there.' It truly is very, very moving.\"",

    "article_text": "Would a Trump 2024 announcement freeze out GOP rivals? As he keeps fighting the 2020 election results and refuses to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, President Trump remains quiet about the possibility of running to reclaim the White House in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to 2024 yet,\u201d the president told reporters on Thanksgiving. ARIZONA, WISCONSIN,\u00a0 FINALIZE BIDEN ELECTION VICTORIES IN THE TWO KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES But behind closed doors, Trump has told advisors that he wants to run again in four years, and\u00a0could potentially announce his bid before or even during Biden's Inauguration on Jan. 20, according to Fox News\u2019 chief White House correspondent John Roberts, who confirmed a report from The Daily Beast. Such an announcement, or even Trump\u2019s flirtation with a third White House run, would definitely put a damper on what was thought to be a wide open battle for the GOP 2024 presidential nomination. And it could potentially freeze out early moves by other Republicans with national aspirations. Republican strategist and GOP presidential campaign veteran Alex Conant says a Trump 2024 announcement would \u201cabsolutely\u201d change the dynamic of the next White House race, \u201cat least at the outset.\u201d \u201cNobody wants to be the first candidate to challenge Trump in 2024. If it were truly an open race, you\u2019d see a lot of potential candidates making some aggressive early moves, going to Iowa, New Hampshire,\u201d noted Conant, a founding partner of consulting firm Firehouse Strategies. \u201cYou would normally see candidates going through the early states before the end of this year.\u201d AN EARLY LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL 2024 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FIEELD While some potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls \u2013 such as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, former ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem - campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire this autumn on behalf of the president and down ballot Republicans, nothing\u2019s on the schedule so far for the rest of this year. \u201c2024 candidates don\u2019t want to talk about Donald Trump. They want to talk about themselves. But so long as he is making noises about running again, the race will be all about him. And these candidates will be less inclined to do the early state travel because it will all be in the shadow of whether or not Trump runs again,\u201d Conant highlighted. Longtime GOP consultant David Carney agrees that with the president mulling a bid to return to the White House, it\u2019s a far different scenario than the wide open fields for the GOP presidential nominations in 2008, 2012, and 2016. But Carney, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns for three decades, emphasized \u201cI don\u2019t think any serious candidate would be scared off because it\u2019s four years. No one knows what\u2019s really going to happen with the president. I don\u2019t see it having much affect right now.\u201d Carney, the founder of the Norway Hill Associates communications and public relations firm, suggested that \u201cmaybe two dozen people are thinking of dipping their toes into the waters and see what happens.\u201d CONSERVATIVE NATIONAL REVIEW RIPS TRUMP'S POST-ELECTION MOVES Dan Eberhart, a prominent donor and bundler for the president and other Republicans, pointed to a waning in the president\u2019s clout. \u201cWhether he likes it or not, the Trump ice cube is melting. He can announce a 2024 bid but the enthusiasm with donors is likely to fund the coffers of people like Cotton, Haley, (Sen. Josh) Hawley (of Missouri), or (Florida Gov. Ron) DeSantis to do battle with Trump,\u201d Eberhart, the CEO of the oil drilling company Canary LLC, told Fox News. Trump has made it clear that he intends to stay very involved in Republican Party politics after he leaves the White House in late January. He set up a leadership PAC immediately after this month\u2019s election, and much of the fundraising the past few weeks for his legal moves to contest the election results are being steered to the new organization. Trump also endorsed Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel \u2013 a major ally \u2013 for another term steering the national party committee.  The president is also heading to Georgia on Saturday, to campaign on behalf of the two Republican incumbents in the state's twin Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, where the GOP's majority in the chamber is at stake. TRUMP SWIPES AT DEWINE AFTER OHIO GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES BIDEN ELECTION VICTORY Trump took aim earlier this month at Gov. Mike DeWine, a day after the Ohio Republican called Biden the president-elect and said that \u201cwe need to begin\u201d the transition between the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration. And on Monday he slammed GOP Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia as \u201chapless\u201d for allowing a \u201csham\u201d recount in the state\u2019s presidential results, which upheld Biden\u2019s narrow victory over Trump.  Both governors are up for re-election in 2022 and could be targeted by Trump. Many Republican member of Congress have yet to urge the president to concede to Biden and have refused to recognize Biden as the election winner, out of apparent fear of the president\u2019s strong backing from Republican voters. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, say they would like to see Trump make a 2024 bid to return to the White House. That\u2019s according to a survey from the University of New Hampshire (UNH) conducted Nov. 19-23. \u201cUntil Republicans come up with an obvious person to replace Trump, he\u2019s going to be seen as the front-runner going into 2024,\u201d noted UNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith. And that\u2019s a problem for other potential GOP presidential contenders. \u201cThe last thing they want to do is have a big press conference in New Hampshire where they leave the impression that they\u2019re going to challenge Donald Trump. Because what\u2019s he going to do \u2013 he\u2019ll start tweeting at them. It\u2019s such a distraction for what they would normally be trying to do right now,\u201d Conant noted. In the absence of very public early state visits, Conant says White House hopefuls \u201cwill continue to do all the behind the scenes work \u2013 talking to donors, calling activists, they\u2019ll do media, they\u2019ll start to build out a team, but just have to be more deferential about it now.\u201d Fox News' chief White House correspondent John Roberts contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "Dr. Scott Atlas resigns as special adviser to Trump on coronavirus EXCLUSIVE: Dr. Scott Atlas, President Trump\u2019s special adviser on the coronavirus pandemic, formally resigned from his post on Monday, Fox News has learned. Atlas, who spoke with the president on Monday, joined the administration in August, and was considered a Special Government Employee (SGE), serving a 130-day detail. Atlas\u2019 role is set to expire this week. COVID-19 VACCINES WILL BE READY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF FDA APPROVAL, AZAR SAYS Fox News exclusively obtained Atlas\u2019s resignation letter Monday, which was dated Dec. 1. In it,\u00a0Atlas touted the Trump administration's work on the coronavirus pandemic, while wishing \"all the\u00a0best\" to the incoming Biden administration. \u201cI am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,\u201d Atlas said, thanking him for \u201cthe honor and privilege to serve on behalf of the American people.\u201d \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus\u2014to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Atlas wrote, adding that he \u201calways relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d \u201cAs time went on, like all scientists and health policy scholars, I learned new information and synthesized the latest data from around the world, all in an effort to provide you with the best information to serve the greater public good,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cBut, perhaps more than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor.\u201d Atlas, who had been criticized throughout his tenure for calling for a reopening, and saying that lockdowns are \u201cextremely harmful\u201d to Americans, said that \u201calthough some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of a civilized society.\u201d \u201cIndeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent,\u201d Atlas said. Atlas went on to tout his work at the White House, and his work with \u201cseveral selfless colleagues in designing specific policies to heighten protection of the vulnerable while safely reopening schools and society.\u201d Atlas pointed to their efforts in increasing and prioritizing \u201cextra personal protective equipment and tens of millions of extra tests to nursing and assisted living facilities,\u201d as well as implementing \u201cmore frequent monitoring updates using clinical guidelines to intensify testing,\u201d and instituting outreach to independent seniors in communities. \u201cWe also successfully designed rational guidelines for safely opening schools, a strategic use of the newly developed testing program, and a national stockpile of drugs for future crises,\u201d Atlas wrote. Shifting to lockdowns he has warned against throughout his tenure, Atlas said they \u201cidentified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children.\u201d \u201cAnd more and more, the relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged,\u201d Atlas added. ATLAS FIRES BACK AGAINST CRITICISMS, SAYS ADVICE BASED ON 'CURRENT SCIENCE' Atlas also touted Operation Warp Speed, and the team that \u201cdelivered on our promised timelines for new drugs and vaccines.\u201d \u201cI congratulate you for your vision, and also congratulate the many who did the exemplory work\u2014we know who they are, even though their names are not those familiar to the public,\u201d Atlas wrote. Atlas went on to wish the best to the incoming Biden Administration. \u201cI sincerely wish the new team all the best as they guide the nation through these trying, polarized times,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cWith the emerging treatments and vaccines, I remain highly optimistic that America will thrive once again and overcome the adversity of the pandemic and all that it has entailed.\u201d Atlas, during his tenure, sparred with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Over the summer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield reportedly criticized Atlas, claiming that \u201ceverything he says is false.\u201d Atlas defended his record and his expertise, and maintained that all of his advice to the president was based on the \u201ccurrent science.\u201d \u201cI was asked to be an adviser on the coronavirus pandemic to the president of the United States and I was asked to do that because I have a 25-year career at top, elite medical centers, as a doctor and in patient care,\u201d Atlas told Fox News this summer. \u201cI also have a 15-year career in public policy, working on health care policy and integrating my medical knowledge in policy.\u201d Atlas added that before his arrival to the White House this summer, \u201cthat expertise had not been present.\u201d \u201cI am here because I understand how to translate complex medical science into plain English for the president of the United States and for everyone else in the White House, and derive\u00a0appropriate public policy from that information,\u201d Atlas said at the time, adding that there is a \u201cfalse belief\u201d that one \u201chas to be a public health official to understand the facts about the pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe way I advise the president is perfectly consistent with the most appropriate strategy for dealing with this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, target diligent protection of the high risk and vulnerable populations, and two, open up schools and society.\u201d Meanwhile, as for a coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration said deliveries of the vaccine will begin as early as this week, and would be available first for front-line workers, medical personnel and senior citizens. The president, on Thanksgiving, argued that his opponent, President-elect Joe\u00a0Biden, should not be given credit for the vaccines, which he referred to as a \"medical miracle\"\u00a0before repeating claims of voting irregularities in the 2020 election. \"Joe Biden failed with the swine flu, H1N1, totally failed with the swine flu,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Don't let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me and I pushed people harder than they've ever been pushed before and we got that approved and through and nobody's ever seen anything like it.\"\u00a0 Trump's comments came ahead of a\u00a0Dec. 10 meeting, where regulators at the Food and Drug Administration will review\u00a0Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine developed with BioNTech.\u00a0 The latest trial data for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine,\u00a0unveiled earlier this month, showed it was 90% effective. In addition, Moderna said its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19. AstraZeneca also reported preliminary results that showed its vaccine efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, depending on the dosage amount given to participants. According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the vaccines will be \u201cshipped\u201d within 24 hours of FDA approval and then it would be up to \u201cnursing homes, hospitals, and pharmacies to get that dispensed.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt really could be within days of FDA approval we\u2019ll start seeing vaccines in people\u2019s arms which is frankly incredible,\u201d Azar said Monday. The United States has reported more than 13.5 million cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and more than 267,000 deaths.",

Waldron also claimed that a witness from Pima County said votes were \"embedded\" in various precincts to achieve a Biden win. \"What I\u00a0take from your testimony, Colonel, is that 35,000 votes were embedded to each Democratic candidate in Pima County, the allegation by the gentleman who hasn't\u00a0given us an affidavit,\" Giuliani said. \"We don\u2019t know if the gentleman is telling the truth or not.\" TRUMP PRESSES GEORGIA\u00a0GOVERNOR TO OVERRULE SECRETARY OF STATE, SCRUTINIZE BALLOT SIGNATURES So far, courts and state and local election officials have not found evidence of widespread voter fraud, enough to overturn the results of the election.\u00a0Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of one percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. Dominion, which is used by several\u00a0states, has pushed back against such claims. Michael Steel, a spokesman for Dominion, previously denied claims that votes cast through the company\u2019s systems were at risk of being altered. He said it is physically impossible to alter votes in the system. \"Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked\u00a0at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally,\"\u00a0he said. MCSALLY CONCEDES TO MARK KELLY IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE Trump's defeat in Arizona - since the margin was greater than a tenth of one percent - doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. Amid the ongoing legal battle, the incoming Biden administration has\u00a0received ascertainment from the U.S. General Services Administration\u00a0as the apparent winner of the election, giving the green light to move\u00a0ahead with transition proceedings.

    "article_text": "Arizona certifies Biden as election winner, with Wisconsin following hours later President Trump suffered another setback in his push to overturn his defeat in the presidential election,\u00a0as Arizona\u00a0on Monday certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The results of the election were certified by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's a Democrat, with GOP Gov. Doug Ducey,\u00a0Republican state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Brutinel in attendance. TRUMP PRESSES 'HAPLESS' REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA TO OVERULE SECRETARY OF STATE Hours after the certifying of the vote in Arizona, Wisconsin finalized their results, becoming the last of the remaining contested battleground states to do so. Biden was projected the winner in Arizona on Election Night by Fox News and The Associated Press. The other major news networks projected Biden as the winner in the state a week later. Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. The former vice president became the first Democrat since President Bill Clinton in 1996 to carry Arizona, and only the third since President Harry Truman in 1948. In Wisconsin, state Elections Commission chair Ann Jacobs signed \"the official state determination of the results of the Nov. 3, 2020 election.\" The move, which confirmed Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, came a day after the completion of a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign. The recount slightly altered the results in Biden\u2019s favor. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers certified the election results later in the day. That kicked off a five-day window for the president to file a lawsuit in Wisconsin. On Saturday, Trump said he would bring a lawsuit in the state by Tuesday. The actions by both states are the latest setback for the president, who refuses to concede to Biden, more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect. Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battlegrounds, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden's victories. Trump's defeat in Arizona -- since the margin was greater than a tenth of 1 percent -- doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. A lawsuit by the state GOP to force a hand recount of some ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest, was dismissed on Nov. 19, due to no evidence of voter fraud. TRUMP BLASTS LEGAL SETBACKS TO HIS PUSH TO OVERTURN HIS ELECTION DEFEAT The top two attorneys steering Trump's legal efforts -- Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- appeared Monday in Phoenix with a group of GOP state lawmakers, for a \"fact-finding\" meeting to discuss potential fraud in the election. The two lawyers took part in a similar meeting last week in Pennsylvania, another state where Biden narrowly defeated the president. Pennsylvania, as well as the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada\u00a0and Georgia, have also certified their election results over the past week and a half. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.

President Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, praised the decision and said that allowing the forensic review is a \u201cbig win for honest elections.\u201d  On Sunday, Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis spoke on the move. She said the team will spend several hours inspecting the machines and gathering data. Local authorities confirmed the machines in question are the same as the ones that were used in the presidential election on November 3. The machines were originally brought into question by a voter who claimed ballots were damaged during a recent recount of a marijuana proposal vote. A similar examination recently occurred in Georgia as President Trump has raised concerns of widespread voter fraud, which rigged the elections.",

As the President grows increasingly frustrated with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he floats the idea of another Republican lawmaker taking his place. At his Republican National Committee rally on Saturday, the President threw his support behind one of his biggest defenders on Capitol Hill, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.). President Trump even suggested Collins should run against Kemp for governor. He also praised the congressman\u2019s efforts in his 2020 bid for senator.  \u201cAs you know, he and Kelly had a very strong primary,\u201d President Trump stated. \u201cHe is one of the greatest advocates I\u2019ve ever met in Washington\u2026I wanna thank Doug Collins.\u201d When the President asked Collins whether he would be interested in the position of governor, the crowd cheered loudly. Collins has been serving as an elected official since 2007. The Georgia lawmaker is a staunch supporter of President Trump as he\u2019s backed the President during impeachment attempts from the left. Collins is also an advocate for the second amendment, veterans, religious liberty and he is pro-life. If the Republican is interested in the position, he would likely have to face off with Kemp in a 2022 primary before going up against a Democrat opponent. \u00a0",

The \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program\u2018 was created by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It grants work permits to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who are known as \u2018dreamers.\u2019 The order reverses a Trump administration memo from July, which sought to prevent widespread abuse of the program. President Trump also sought to create a new constitutional path for immigrants to become U.S. citizens. However, the effort was met with resistance from Democrats who have defended the \u2018DACA\u2019 program, despite widespread abuse by criminals seeking to conduct illegal activity in the U.S. The Trump administration also argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers by bypassing Congress when he created DACA.

    "article_text": "President Trump\u2019s legal team claims 40K double votes found in Nev. In addition to other voting irregularities in Nevada, the Trump campaign said that tens-of-thousands of people voted twice. On Thursday, Trump campaign attorney Jesse Binnall told a judge that over 40,000 people voted twice, while 20,000 voters did not have a mailing address and roughly 2,400 voters had an out of state address. The Trump attorney also said a local news station found that 1,500 ballots were cast under dead people\u2019s names. Additionally, Binnall argued that voting machines in Clark County lacked proper security. This information emerged during the Trump legal team\u2019s hearing in front of a state judge on voter fraud.  \u201cThe questions are how did this happen? Who is responsible?\u201d Binnall asked. \u201cAnd what do we do about it?\u201d While addressing the court, Binnall said early policy decisions made by state election officials ultimately set the state up for failure, even months before the election ever took place.  \u201cIt was not an unforeseeable problem,\u201d Binnall added. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that people were making clear all along. That there was going to be issues if we didn\u2019t take robust efforts in order to make sure that every voter was only voting once.\u201d Binnall specifically highlighted changes to general election procedures that took place before November. These changes removed restrictions on mail-in voter registration. He said that legislators\u2019 decision to adopt AB4 \u201ctook us to a system of universal mail voting at pretty much the last minute.\u201d Back in August, Democrat Governor Steve Sisolak signed AB4 into law in response to the pandemic. He promised a fair and accessible election. Due to the new policy, the number of mail-in ballots cast increased from 6,300 in 2016 to more than 690,000 in 2020. Come Election Day, the wave of mail-in ballots on top of record-high in-person turnout overwhelmed poll-workers. \u201cAs a result, there was a system that was ripe for the picking when it came to fraud,\u201d Binnall claimed. \u201cAnd the fraud came.\u201d Binnall also mentioned that poll workers went on to restrict meaningful access to Republican poll watchers, which made them unable to monitor and ensure the accuracy of the counting process. \u201cElection officials planned and implemented an election system that would be highly susceptible to fraud,\u201d Binnall said. \u201cIt would ignore the best practices developed over the years and skew meaningful observation.\u201d The President\u2019s campaign has argued that the push for election integrity supersedes any political agenda. He stressed that upholding the integrity of American democracy is the primary goal of their legal battle. \u201cTransparency is not political, transparency is something that is necessary for us to have a democratic election,\u201d Binnall emphasized. \u201cSo that we know it is the candidate chosen by the voters that is the one actually elected.\u201d Judge James Russell said he wants to review all of the evidence presented and will make his decision Friday.",

Brian Kemp calls for signature audit In Georgia, Rudy Giuliani heard from witnesses who detailed alleged instances of voter fraud in the battleground state. A video of poll-workers who carried suitcases stuffed with ballots captured the attention of the nation as President Trump\u2019s legal team presented further evidence of voter fraud. On Thursday, the President\u2019s attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis questioned witnesses in the Peach State. Witnesses alleged the election results were undermined by rampant fraud. The Trump campaign posted a video of One America\u2019s coverage of the hearing. The mainstream media chose to ignore the fact-finding session.  Jackie Pick, a lawyer volunteering for the Trump team, presented video evidence of Georgia poll workers at State Farm Arena. The video showed workers reaching under tables and pulling out suitcases stuffed with ballots. Some of them were even forced to evacuate over false alarms of a burst pipe, but Pick provided testimony of what actually happened on Election Day.  \u201cNot everybody left according to plan and some people stayed behind, so this shocked them,\u201d Pick stated. \u201cThey returned to State Farm Arena at about one o\u2019clock in the morning, where they confirmed that in fact, people had just left\u2026 in contradiction with what they were told by those supervising.\u201d One witness noted that not only did 2,506 felons vote illegally, but 66,248 underage individuals did as well. The law requires voters to be 17.5 years old to legitimately vote, but thousands were able to vote before their 17th birthday.\u00a0 He also added that at least two thousand individuals were not listed as registered voters. The examples continued to pile up from there. Notably, Georgia\u2019s current election results show Democrat nominee Joe Biden with just a 13,000 vote lead. In the meantime, protesters gathered outside of the Atlanta Court House \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 event. Thursday\u2019s event showed support for President Trump while casting doubt on the number of votes in favor of Joe Biden.  \u201cI\u2019m out here to support the Stop the Steal movement,\u201d a demonstrator said. \u201cI believe in what President Trump has been doing for the last four years, like I said, this country has prospered.\u201d In an interview Thursday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp called for more transparency in the state\u2019s election system. He added he believes a signature audit must be carried out for the 2020 elections. The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team is set to continue their fight to ensure free and fair elections. They\u2019ve already traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and now Georiga to present evidence of illegitimate election results.",

    "article_text": "President Trump: GOP senators getting cold feet over ending Section 230 President Trump called out GOP senators who seem to be backing off the fight against Section 230. The President took to Twitter on Thursday to slam the senators and to emphasize that the termination must be put in the Defense Bill.  \u00a0 On Tuesday, President Trump called for the end of Section 230. Section 230 gives companies like Facebook and Twitter the protection of neutral forums rather than publishers.  Critics pointed out these platforms, however, often pick and choose what content they host, which means they act as editors rather than true neutral hosts. President Trump warned if this \u201cdangerous and unfair\u201d law is not completely terminated as part of the \u2018National Defense Authorization Act,\u2019 he would veto the bill. The President has long spoken out against Section 230. Back in May, he signed an executive order to protect the free speech of all Americans.  \u00a0 \u201cMy executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it so that social media companies that engage in censoring any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield,\u201d President Trump stated. \u201cThey have a shield; they can do what they want. They\u2019re not going to have that shield.\u201d Some senators have called for more discussion over Section 230. They said the Defense Bill isn\u2019t the place to pressure for change. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany assured the military would get proper funding, but the President is serious about the concerns surrounding the law. \u201cThe President will always defend our military and make sure that we get adequate defense funding as he\u2019s gotten $2.9 trillion so far,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cBut he is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d On Thursday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy noted the NDAA will get done, but also pointed to the need to do away with Section 230. \u201cWe know that we will get an NDAA done as we\u2019ve done for the last 60 years, but we also know that Section 230\u2026needs to be repealed,\u201d McCarthy stated. \u201cThese technology companies are not acting in the manner of why 230 was created to give them protections that they want to pick and choose what goes on.\u201d McCarthy emphasized that Big Tech doesn\u2019t need the protection any longer. The renewed push to change Section 230 came earlier this year when platforms refused to host a \u2018New York Post\u2018 article, which detailed a hard drive belonging to Hunter Biden. The hard drive linked his business dealings to his father, Joe Biden. In October, the FCC announced it had the legal authority to interpret Section 230 and would move forward with rule-making to clarify its meaning, which was part of the President\u2019s May executive order. \u00a0",

On Wednesday, the White House posted the President\u2019s 45 minute speech on social media in which he detailed multiple instances of voting irregularities. \u201cIn Wisconsin as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes,\u201d the President explained. \u201cI can show you right here that Wisconsin, we\u2019re leading by a lot and then at 3:42 in the morning there was this, it was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden.\u201d Given the evidence of a lack of security in the 2020 elections, the President went on to suggest his political opponent is supported by something more sinister. \u201cThe corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching it now for four years., these entrenched interests oppose our movement because we put America first.\u201d The President has raised concerns Joe Biden seemed to take a backseat in campaigns, while insisting Democrat leaders knew the elections were over before they even began.  President Trump also accused the Democrat establishment of taking advantage of the pandemic by making last minute changes to election procedure. and pushing for universal mail-in-voting. \u2018This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the flood gates to massive fraud,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state and even our non-citizens of our country.\u201d From ineligible voters casting their ballots to cyber attacks, the President said the elections were riddled with voter fraud. He went on to warn similar instances might be seen in Georgia\u2019s January runoffs. This comes as Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are set to defend their seats in a race that is expected to determine which party will control the Senate. President Trump is expected to rally for the Georgia Republicans this weekend while his legal team continues to push for election integrity across the country.",

    "article_text": "Allies of President Trump concerned DOJ will not conduct meaningful investigation into voter fraud Allies of the President are calling on the Justice Department to step up efforts to investigate election fraud. On Wednesday, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told One America News that while he\u2019s optimistic the Department of Justice will conduct a thorough review, he\u2019s still a little cynical. President Trump\u2019s campaign continues to maintain that it has evidence of voter fraud in at least six key states despite recent comments by Attorney General William Barr. Biggs also noted shortcomings by the Justice Department, which have prompted concerns about its ability to fulfill its duty. \u201cWe\u2019ve expected the Durham report for a year now\u2026 and we never got it,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cThey\u2019re not out there really busting things to break this thing down to try to resolve some of these issues.\u201d  He added that although we\u2019re seeing more specific allegations, affidavits and evidence, there is still no proof that the attorney general is actively investigating these incidents. Biggs mentioned he hopes the search for evidence of voter fraud continues. He noted that audits would help determine if further remedies are needed. Meanwhile, political consultant Roger Stone also took aim at Barr, calling him \u201cpart of the deep state.\u201d In a video Tuesday, Stone claimed Barr is blocking the nation\u2019s two-tiered justice system. This came after Barr\u2019s remarks, which claim the Justice Department found no substantial voter fraud thus far. Stone went on to cite Barr\u2019s failure to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey as well as former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Additionally, Stone criticized the ongoing \u2018Durham\u2019 probe by calling it a ploy. Stone said there is overwhelming and compelling evidence of voter fraud in the election despite Barr\u2019s claims. \u00a0",

Linda Brickman testified before Arizona state legislators on Monday, stating that she witnessed votes being entered into the Dominion system automatically changed to reflect a vote for Biden. She said she was threatened and barred from the counting room after telling her supervisor what she saw. Despite multiple witnesses coming forward with similar stories, counters were reportedly never told whether any action had been taken to correct the miscount.  Maricopa County is among the largest in the nation with more than 2 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cI read her a Trump Republican ballot and as soon as she entered it into the system, the ballot defaulted on the screen to a Biden Democratic ballot,\u201d explained the GOP vice chairwoman. Brickman said her purpose of appearing at the hearing was to speak the truth and protect the integrity of the election.",

Paul Ostrowski of Operation Warp Speed said 100 percent of Americans will have the opportunity to take a COVID-19 vaccine by June of 2021. He made those remarks Monday while speaking to reporters. However, that\u2019s not the only development on the vaccine front. In a press release the same day, biotech company Moderna said it plans to apply for Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be filing (today) around the world, first regulatory approval for the product for regulators to review it and the FDA has told us an advisory meeting is likely to be meeting on December 17,\u201d stated Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. \u201cIt is highly possible that between the 17th and Christmas, the product is approved.\u201d It\u2019s the latest candidate to reach that stage following Pfizer and BioNTech, which both have a vaccine already under regulatory review. If Moderna is granted authorization, its vaccine could be available as soon as December 21. In light of the news, President Trump urged the FDA to \u201cact quickly.\u201d He added, \u201cOperation Warp Speed has been a great modern day miracle.\u201d  Moderna has received $1 billion under Operation Warp Speed to fund its vaccine research. The company has also already taken a $1.5 billion order from the U.S. for the pre-manufacturing of 100 million doses of its vaccine, which the company said is 94.1 percent effective and expected to cost about $25 per dose. Moving forward, the vaccine may be approved as soon as Christmas in which case it would likely be distributed to high priority groups first, including frontline medical workers and likely residents of nursing homes.",

While taking to Twitter Monday, the President questioned why Gov. Brian Kemp (R) will not use his emergency powers to overrule the secretary of state and do a match of signatures on envelopes. He said it would be a \u201cgoldmine\u201d of fraud. The President also called on officials to check the number of envelopes versus ballots, suggesting they won\u2019t match up.  In response, Kemp\u2019s office claimed state law bars him from intervening in elections, noting he\u2019s unable to override the secretary of state by executive order. On Monday, however, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office has opened more than 250 cases of voting irregularities and allegations of voter fraud. This came after the Trump campaign requested that Raffensperger order an immediate audit of signatures on absentee ballots and applications received in all counties. Meanwhile, a machine recount is now underway in Georgia with officials expecting the effort to be completed this week.",

GOP hold hearing on election integrity President Trump\u2019s legal team held a public hearing with Arizona GOP state legislators on election integrity. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Phoenix, officials laid out evidence related to electoral compromise and irregularities. Officials confirmed the state used software by Dominion Voting Systems, which attorney Rudy Giuliani called a troubled foreign company with the \u201cmost porous\u201d system of all the automatic voting machine companies.  One poll watcher testified she was certified to witness poll workers study questionable ballots, but was denied access to watch. The purpose of the public hearing was to collect evidence in the 2020 election, which would justify holding a special session for state lawmakers to investigate. Meanwhile, retired Col. Phil Waldron also confirmed voting machines in Arizona used Smartmatic derivative software. He explained it\u2019s a common software being used in the U.S. His testimony indirectly confirms the claims of potential Venezuelan and Iranian meddling in the election, which went through Scytl servers in Europe.  Waldron\u2019s testimony confirmed foreign meddling was helping Joe Biden and switching votes away from President Trump. Attorney Sidney Powell said the Scytl server has since been seized and secure by who she called \u201cthe good guys.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump admin. proposes new rule to protect the fossil fuel industry from discriminatory banks The Trump administration is looking to implement a new rule through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to keep banks from discriminating against fossil fuel companies by way of denying them finances. This comes after an October decision where five of the six largest banks in the U.S. pledged to end financing for oil companies who look to drill in the Arctic. These banks include Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. The most push-back over the banks\u2019 decision came from Republicans in states with large energy industries, while the loudest praise came from environmentalist groups and authors like 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben. Banks are not the only ones taking an activist position on the issue. Investment groups like BlackRock are also picking and choosing whom to give loans on what many Republicans believe is a discriminatory basis. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink claims his company is only spending money where their investors want it to go, which he said is environmental action. \u201cWe are responding to our client\u2019s wishes, where they want their money to be placed,\u201d he stated. This proposal by the Trump administration ultimately takes the ability to be activists away from banks who, by denying funds to fossil fuel companies, are ultimately using their wealth and influence to direct U.S. energy policy even though the public never elected them to make those decisions. What many Republicans believe this new rule will do is keep private banks from discriminating against completely law abiding companies and, perhaps, take away the ability for banks to become activists who only invest in industries or companies they agree with. Ultimately, this even relieves pressure on the private citizen whose only issue to consider when doing business with a bank is if it\u2019s a good financial decision for themselves and not what political issues that bank chooses to support.",
