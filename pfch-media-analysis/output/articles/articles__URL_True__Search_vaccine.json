    "article_text": "Scandal Dogs AstraZeneca\u2019s Vaccine Partner in China As a government regulator sidled into a car, the Chinese pharmaceutical executive handed over a paper bag stuffed with $44,000 in cash. The executive, Du Weimin, was eager to get his company\u2019s vaccines approved, and he needed help. The official took the money and vowed to try his best, according to court documents from 2016. Several months later, Mr. Du got the greenlight to begin clinical trials for two vaccines. They were ultimately approved, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. The government official was jailed for taking bribes from Mr. Du and several other vaccine makers. Mr. Du was never charged. Instead, he built an empire. His company, Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products, is one of China\u2019s largest vaccine makers. And Mr. Du, dubbed the \u201cking of vaccines,\u201d is one of the richest men in China. Capitalizing on that success, Mr. Du and his company are now at the forefront of the global race to produce a coronavirus vaccine, a national priority for China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. Kangtai will be the exclusive manufacturer in mainland China for the vaccine made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the companies could work together on deals for other countries. The Chinese company is also in early trials for its own candidate. Mr. Du\u2019s success, against the backdrop of scandal, is not an outlier in China. It is the norm. As the Chinese government has pushed to develop vaccine companies of global renown, the state has fostered and protected an industry plagued by corruption and controversy. Drug companies, eager to get their products into the hands of consumers, have used financial incentives to sway poorly compensated government workers for regulatory approvals. Hundreds of Chinese officials have been accused in recent years of taking bribes in cases involving vaccine companies, according to a review of court records. The companies and executives implicated rarely face punishment. Oversight has been weak, contributing to a spate of scandals over substandard vaccines. While the government after each incident has vowed to do more to clean up the industry, regulators have rarely provided much information about what went wrong. Companies have often emerged unscathed after making an apology or paying a fine, and in nearly all instances, they have been allowed to continue operating. Dr. Ray Yip, a former head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in China, said he considers Kangtai to be among the top tiers of the country\u2019s vaccine companies, adding that he \u201chas no problem\u201d with the manufacturing and technology standards of most players. \u201cThe problem for many of them is their business practice,\u201d said Dr. Yip, who also led the China office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThey all want to sell to the local governments, so they have to do kickbacks, they have to bribe. That\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel of China\u2019s vaccine business.\u201d Kangtai did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a statement, AstraZeneca said it \u201cconducts appropriate and thorough due diligence prior to entering an agreement with any entity.\u201d \u201cSafety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine is of utmost importance, and AstraZeneca has partnered with capable, established organizations to help ensure broad and equitable global access, at no profit during the pandemic,\u201d the company said. The lack of transparency, compounded by dubious business practices, has rattled public confidence in Chinese-made vaccines, even though they have been proved safe. Many well-off parents shun them, preferring their Western counterparts. In 2013, 17 infants died after injections with Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccine. Regulators cleared Kangtai of wrongdoing, and the vaccine continues to be used safely. But the government didn\u2019t provide substantial details about its investigation into the deaths or Kangtai\u2019s safety practices; the company had negative articles retracted. Distraught parents around the world blame vaccine makers for their children\u2019s illnesses or their untimely deaths, often without scientific evidence. But in China, the government muzzles many families, further feeding suspicions about Chinese-made vaccines. Activists who have called for greater scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies, including Kangtai, have been harassed, intimidated and detained. Worried about the threat to social stability, Chinese officials have tried to stop them from organizing, by shuttering social media groups and monitoring their communications. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the 2013 scandal \u201craises legitimate concerns\u201d about Kangtai. \u201cThe stakes are very high,\u201d Dr. Huang said. \u201cImagine if a similar scandal is reported again in China. It\u2019s not just going to undermine the confidence of the company manufacturing the vaccine, it\u2019s also going to hurt the reputation of AstraZeneca itself and their vaccine, too.\u201d As the chief executive of a small vaccine maker in the early 2000s, Mr. Du was looking to grow. He set his sights abroad, visiting pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology research institutes in Western countries, including the United States, Britain and France. Mr. Du, then in his mid-30s, came away from his meetings with an urgent conclusion, he recalled in interviews with Chinese news outlets. It was a mistake for China to continue relying on foreign vaccines, Mr. Du had determined. They were expensive. And he worried that China\u2019s dependence on other countries posed \u201chidden dangers to national security.\u201d \u201cVaccines for the Chinese people must firmly be in the hands of the Chinese,\u201d Mr. Du told a state-owned newspaper, the Jiangxi Daily, in 2014. His timing was good. After years of relying on multinational companies for crucial medicine, the Chinese government wanted to cultivate a homegrown vaccine industry, for many of the same reasons. State-run companies had long dominated the business in China, going back to the Mao era. As demand increased, entrepreneurs like Mr. Du saw an opportunity to build companies that could compete on the global stage. Many embraced partnerships with overseas vaccine makers, a strategy that China followed in other areas like technology and auto manufacturing. The international companies gained access to the Chinese market, while the Chinese companies secured valuable knowledge about production techniques and technology. Such deals would help catapult Mr. Du, the son of farmers from a poor mountainous area of Jiangxi Province, into the big leagues. After helping found Beijing Minhai Biotechnology in 2004, he teamed up with the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur on a rabies vaccine. At the time, the Chinese government was leading a concerted effort to limit the spread of the disease, which killed more than 2,600 people in China that year. In 2008, Mr. Du moved to expand his business by investing in Kangtai. The company was founded in 1992 with help from the American drugmaker Merck. Together, they produced a hepatitis B vaccine, as part of a joint venture aimed at improving health standards in China. His dealmaking would create an industry giant. Local media called him \u201cthe warrior of the vaccine kingdom.\u201d His net worth was an estimated $7.4 billion until May, when Mr. Du transferred $3.5 billion worth of shares in his company to his ex-wife, Yuan Liping, in what Chinese news outlets described as China\u2019s most expensive divorce ever. Ms. Yuan, a Canadian citizen, is now one of Canada\u2019s richest women. \u201cFrom starting his company to getting rich to getting divorced,\u201d China Times, a mainland news site, wrote about the tycoon, \u201cthe mysteries that he holds can only be solved with time.\u201d The timing seemed suspicious. In 2010, the state-run China Youth Daily newspaper reported that regulators had delayed telling the public that about 180,000 doses of a rabies vaccine were ineffective. The vaccine was made by Jiangsu Yanshen, then owned by Mr. Du of Kangtai. During the delay, which lasted nine months, Mr. Du sold a roughly 51 percent stake in the company to the Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, another drug manufacturer, according to the Economic Observer website, a financial news outlet. An investigative journalist, Du Taoxin, started digging. Industry insiders, he said, confirmed the reports, telling him that regulators held off on the announcement so that Du Weimin could sell the shares and not be held liable for the scandal. It lined up with a report in the state-backed China National Radio. The article similarly named Mr. Du and found that the authorities had withheld the information so that Simcere would have to bear the reputational costs of the scandal. After reports of the faulty vaccines, Simcere issued a statement saying that the quality issues occurred before it invested in Jiangsu Yanshen, emphasizing that it bore \u201cno responsibility for the incident.\u201d Mr. Du, the pharmaceutical executive, would not comment. In August 2014, the journalist published his article under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s Drug Regulators Caught Up in \u2018Whistleblowing Scandals,\u2019 Unveiling the Truth Behind Vaccine Cases.\u201d Many of the industry\u2019s problems are born out of a symbiotic relationship with the government. China\u2019s vaccines are administered through local communicable disease control centers. Those centers take a cut of the profit for certain types of vaccines, creating an incentive for corruption. From 2018 to 2020, there were 59 corruption lawsuits involving vaccine companies, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Fifty-four of them involved bribing local officials. Kangtai sued the journalist, Du Taoxin, and his newspaper, Democracy and the Rule of Law, claiming defamation. The journalist and his newspaper tried to defend the work, submitting what they viewed as other evidence of media pressure. Guangdong Satellite, a state-backed television station, had apologized in September 2014 for \u201churting the feelings\u201d of Mr. Du Weimin after a prominent Chinese economist criticized the tycoon\u2019s company in a program. The station retracted its story. The 21st Century Business Herald, an influential business newspaper, had deleted seven articles that it published relating to Mr. Du\u2019s company and the deaths of newborns who were given Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccines in 2013, according to court documents. They had closely covered several of the deaths and reported that Mr. Du\u2019s family had previously immigrated to Canada. As part of his defense, the journalist noted the article by China National Radio on the same topic. It\u2019s unclear why those media outlets didn\u2019t face legal action. The vaccine tycoon was represented by Zhang He. Mr. Zhang had also served as the lawyer for Yin Hongzhang, the drug regulator who was convicted of accepting bribes from Mr. Du. The journalist pointed to the bribery case as proof he had not defamed the executive in his article. Du Weimin acknowledged, in court documents, that he was the Mr. Du who had bribed Mr. Yin. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But the judge said that information was not pertinent to the case. The judge, in forming his ruling, also cited the journalist\u2019s refusal to disclose the identities of his anonymous sources. On November 2016, Du Taoxin was convicted of \u201churting the reputation\u201d of Du Weimin. The court said Mr. Du\u2019s articles had \u201cled to a decline in the society\u2019s evaluation of Du Weimin and infringed on his reputation.\u201d He had to pay Mr. Du $300, and his newspaper had to delete the article. The sentence was meted out on Chinese Journalists\u2019 Day. Mr. Du quit journalism a year later. \u201cVaccines seem to be an untouchable issue,\u201d said Mr. Du. \u201cNo matter how I persisted in chasing the truth, it always seemed elusive. I had all the evidence, but I knew that this was a lawsuit that could never be won.\u201d A group of Chinese families have led a small but spirited effort in recent years to regulate the nation\u2019s vaccine industry more strictly. The government, which views political organizing as a threat to the Communist Party, has sought to silence their campaign. Officials have harassed and detained mothers, fathers and grandmothers, charging them with \u201cdisrupting public order\u201d or \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble.\u201d In October, the authorities in the central province of Henan detained He Fangmei, one of the most outspoken critics of Chinese vaccine companies in China, according to her friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the legal sensitivity. Lawyers representing vaccine activists have faced severe punishments. Many of the online groups families use to share grievances and coordinate protests on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat have been shut down. Liao Fangsheng tried to petition the central government after his son, Pengyong, was found to have viral encephalitis. Mr. Liao said his son was a happy and healthy 18-month-old before he took a vaccine made by Kangtai. Two or three days after the inoculation, Pengyong developed a low-grade fever and then fell into a coma for 17 days. In December 2019, the local health commission said it was a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that the boy had become ill after taking the vaccine. Mr. Liao didn\u2019t have any scientific evidence, but he remained convinced that the vaccine was connected. He traveled to Beijing to the National Health Commission and the petition bureau, where people go to seek help for their grievances. They directed him to other government departments, what he described as \u201cbuck-passing.\u201d After he tried to seek help outside the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound, he was detained for a week in his hometown in southeastern Jiangxi Province. The authorities said he was \u201cdisrupting the order of a workplace,\u201d according to a copy of the detention notice. \u201cThey all wear one pair of trousers, their superiors protect their subordinates,\u201d said Mr. Liao. \u201cNo one looks at any of the materials I hand over. There is no space for me to talk. Where do you think the law is? Where is the government?\u201d The Chinese government may have reason to shield the industry from criticism. In a country of 1.4 billion people, rumors can quickly spread, undermining China\u2019s effort to protect the health of the nation. But the dearth of information and lack of legal recourse can also breed a deep distrust. In 2010, dozens of elementary school students from southern Guangdong Province experienced headaches, vomiting and limb weakness after they were injected with Kangtai\u2019s hepatitis B vaccine. A provincial health official attributed the problems to a \u201cmass-based psychogenic reaction,\u201d according to the state-run China News Service. The official, Peng Guowen, director of the institute of immunization of the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that most of the symptoms such as dizziness or abdominal pain were \u201csubjective\u201d and that none of the students developed fever. He blamed rumors that had spread among the news media and society about the safety of vaccines, saying they had \u201caggravated\u201d the students\u2019 anxiety and caused the vomiting. In a separate news conference, a reporter asked how the government could conclude that the students\u2019 adverse reactions had nothing to do with the vaccine before the test results were out. Officials did not answer, according to The Southern Metropolis Daily. In 2013, after reports emerged that 17 infants had died after they took the same vaccine, the Chinese media and the public called Mr. Du a \u201cbaby-killer.\u201d The government stopped the sale of the vaccines in December for over a month. It lifted the suspension after it concluded that the company was not to blame. The release about the official investigation provided little detail. It mainly took note of the deaths and listed their causes, which included pneumonia, heart disease and diarrhea, according to a government statement. China has been less forthcoming about questions of vaccine safety than other countries. In the United States, the federal government often commissions in-depth assessments after manufacturers report problems with vaccines. In South Korea, where a string of deaths recently undermined confidence in a flu vaccine, the government released detailed data on the deaths as it worked to restore public trust. As China now tries to burnish its global standing as a scientific and medical power, the reputation of its vaccine makers is all the more important. For decades, the industry has focused on selling products in China, believing that the domestic market was big enough to sustain the business. Few companies have discovered products with worldwide impact. Only five Chinese vaccines have been preapproved for export by the World Health Organization. By contrast, India has 47 vaccines that have passed those requirements. To China, the pandemic offers a chance to transform the industry into a global player \u2014 and it\u2019s investing heavily in champions like Kangtai. The local government in the southern city of Shenzhen gave the company a 20,000-square-meter piece of land, which is now the base for Kangtai\u2019s coronavirus vaccine plant. Kangtai has also received government funding as part of the country\u2019s effort to fight the pandemic. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced late last month that their vaccine appeared effective, although the level of effectiveness is disputed. Under the deal with AstraZeneca, Kangtai will produce 200 million doses for mainland China. In late September, Kangtai announced that it would start testing its own coronavirus vaccine on people in China after results showed that it protected mice and monkeys. In an interview with China Central Television, the state broadcaster, Zheng Haifa, a top scientist at Kangtai, said the company was working to achieve a breakthrough in developing a vaccine \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to meet the demands of China\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, who has called on the nation\u2019s pharmaceutical companies to lead an all-out effort to produce a vaccine. Mr. Zheng said the company\u2019s mission was simple: \u201cto provide safe and effective protection for the lives and health of people.\u201d Katie Thomas contributed reporting.

    "article_text": "All Santa Wants for Christmas Is to Stay Out of Politics Ric Erwin is one of thousands of men for whom Santa Claus is both a sacred idea and a seasonal occupation. Earlier this year, he was looking forward to donning his red velvet suit and hat this December, just as he has each winter for the last decade. But the pandemic has thrown a wrench in the usual Christmas shows and shopping mall photo ops. And Mr. Erwin, 62, who is the chairman of the board of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas \u2014 a national association for men who grow and maintain their own beards to play Santa Claus at holiday events \u2014 has found himself advocating for 500 professionals to safely support their work while virus cases are surging. [How Santas in New York are staying safe this year.] In September, Mr. Erwin, who lives in Hemet, Calif., testified virtually before the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. He noted that the production and distribution of an H1N1 vaccine in 2009 allowed Santa Claus performers to save Christmas that year. He hoped the C.D.C. could similarly expedite a vaccine in time for this holiday season. After his testimony, Mr. Erwin received several phone calls, voicemails and emails from Michael R. Caputo, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, who hoped to broker a deal with the Santas. Mr. Erwin recalled Mr. Caputo telling him that the White House was interested in having Santas participate in a 35-city rollout campaign for Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. In exchange, he promised the Santas access to a vaccine by mid-October. \u201cThat sounded like a great deal to us,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. \u201cWithin 24 hours we had over 100 volunteers. The response was overwhelming.\u201d Mr. Caputo told Mr. Erwin he couldn\u2019t wait to tell President Trump that the Santas were onboard with the plan. Then, Mr. Erwin said, Mr. Caputo, the C.D.C. and the H.H.S. ghosted him. Mr. Erwin realized Mr. Caputo was never going to call him back when The Wall Street Journal published an article in late October stating that the campaign, which was meant to include not only Santa players but also celebrities, had been scrapped. (In a statement to The New York Times, an H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated: \u201cThis collaboration will not be happening.\u201d) \u201cWe saw the handwriting on the wall and we knew there was not going to be a collaboration at that point, so if we were going to save Christmas this year it was just going to be the Clauses,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. In addition to stoking some false hope, his negotiations with the federal government drew attention to the myriad societies Santa Claus performers belong to today (though the word \u201cperformers\u201d is scorned by those who take a method approach to the role). There are regional groups (like the Lone Star Santas and the New England Santa Society), as well as national and international ones. For the most part, these organizations try to stay out of politics, activism and other kinds of campaigning. So some Santas were annoyed. \u201cFirst of all, Santa lives in the North Pole \u2014 he doesn\u2019t live in the United States,\u201d said Stephen Arnold, 70, a Memphis resident and president of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas (I.B.R.B.S.), a trade group with more than 2,000 members. \u201cHe might have an interest in seeing that the United States is a calm and safe place for him to visit and deliver Christmas presents, but as a Santa Claus, you shouldn\u2019t have a political posture.\u201d Mr. Arnold added that his understanding was that only four or five people would end up eligible for an early shot of the vaccine according to the offer Mr. Caputo made to Mr. Erwin. To be fair, Mr. Arnold and Mr. Erwin have some history. The Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (F.O.R.B.S.) emerged out of the dissolution more than a decade ago of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (A.O.R.B.S.), which was wrapped in scandal at the time. (\u201cIf you Google \u2018Santa Wars,\u2019 you\u2019ll find articles on it,\u201d Mr. Arnold said.) Today, F.O.R.B.S. is much smaller than I.B.R.B.S., which also includes Mrs. Clauses, and there are members of each group who will not forget the Santa tension of years past. Personal matters aside, Mr. Arnold said his resistance to take part in the government campaign revolved largely around a desire to remain apolitical. \u201cMost of our members were reluctant to consider being first in line because they felt that the whole thing on vaccines was being politically manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work very hard on not being political. We do not allow any political posts or anything on our Facebook group pages.\u201d \u201cIf somebody posts something that\u2019s even slightly interpreted as a political statement, it\u2019s gone instantly,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just deleted.\u201d Should a member like to make a statement out-of-character, that\u2019s fine, Mr. Arnold said. \u201cWe encourage all of our Santas who want to make political posts to create a separate page where they don\u2019t wear any red, and don\u2019t indicate they\u2019re Santa Claus or have Santa in their names,\u201d he said. At this point, according to C.D.C. recommendations, Santa players shouldn\u2019t expect to be vaccinated before Christmas. So, what does that mean for this holiday season? \u201cGenerally speaking, within the Santa community, we are being as cautious as possible,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cThere\u2019s a small contingency of people who have laughed it off and said \u2018I\u2019m going to go on normally, I won\u2019t be performing with a mask.\u2019\u201d Most members of Santa organizations, however, are considered high-risk coronavirus candidates: They are retirees in their 70s and 80s and many have underlying health conditions, Mr. Erwin said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a group of people that are more compromised than the Christmas Committee,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cA lot of us are old and have diabetes. Most of us have a heart problem, most of us are obese. We check every box.\u201d While many Santa-related innovations have come out of 2020 \u2014 holiday-themed masks, plexiglass and acrylic walls that can be made to look invisible in photos, video calls, drive-through greetings \u2014 Mr. Erwin is most enticed by the idea of placing Santa in a vinyl dome. The dome provides physical separation, but it can also be explained with a clever story for the children to understand, Mr. Erwin said. \u201cIf parents don\u2019t want to explain virus transmission, they can say Santa got trapped in a snow globe by an elf magician and you have to come visit him at the globe,\u201d he said. But Mr. Erwin won\u2019t be scheduling any in-person visits this year. His father-in-law suffered a stroke in April and was hospitalized for 30 days before he died; none of his family members were able to visit because of the pandemic. Mr. Erwin told his wife and his mother-in-law, who makes Santa costumes and goes by Mother Claus, that he would not take any chances with the virus. \u201cI don\u2019t even care about giving up my season,\u201d Mr. Erwin said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the 150,000 plus people that did not have to die.\u201d He blames the rising toll on the current administration and plans to deliver fitting gifts to its members this Christmas. \u201cAs a Santa, I am neutral and love everybody, but as a citizen I have to say something,\u201d Mr. Erwin said, adding that he would not be giving politicians coal. \u201cThey are getting dryer lint, at best.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Residents of nursing homes could receive vaccine by the end of December, official says. Trump administration officials on Sunday laid out an ambitious timetable for the rollout of the first coronavirus vaccine in the United States, rebuking President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s criticism that there was \u201cno detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen\u201d for getting people immunized. Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the administration\u2019s program to develop and deploy vaccines, said that residents of long-term care facilities will receive the first round of vaccinations by mid-January, perhaps even by the end of December. In some states, this group accounts for about 40 percent of deaths from the coronavirus. The timing assumes that the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the vaccine, made by Pfizer, this week or shortly thereafter. An advisory committee to the agency will meet on Thursday to review the data on safety and efficacy. Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, on Sunday predicted authorization \u201cwithin days\u201d of the meeting. \u201cIf things are on track, the advisory committee goes well, I believe we could see F.D.A. authorization within days,\u201d Mr. Azar said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to go according to F.D.A. gold-standard processes.\u201d When it comes to distribution, he voiced concern for elderly populations and minorities, but noted, \u201cOur governors make the call at the end of the day on whom they will prioritize.\u201d If the agency authorizes the vaccine, distribution could begin as soon as the end of this week, Dr. Slaoui, the Operation Warp Speed adviser, said. \u201cBy end of the month of January, we should already see quite a significant decrease in mortality in the elderly population,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Barring unexpected problems with manufacturing the vaccine, most Americans at high risk from coronavirus infection should be vaccinated by mid-March, and the rest of the population by May or June, he added. President-elect Biden sounded a considerably more skeptical note on Friday, saying that there was \u201cno detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen, anyway, as to how you get the vaccine out of a container, into an injection syringe, into somebody\u2019s arm.\u201d Dr. Slaoui said his team expected to meet Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers this week and brief them on details of the plan for the vaccines\u2019 distribution. Britain has already approved the Pfizer vaccine and expects to begin immunizing its population this week. Like the F.D.A., European regulators are still examining data on the vaccine\u2019s safety and effectiveness. A second vaccine, made by Moderna, also has been submitted to the F.D.A. for emergency authorization. Dr. Slaoui was optimistic about long-term protection from the vaccine. The elderly or people with compromised immune systems might need a booster in three to five years, he said, but for most people the vaccine should remain effective for \u201cmany, many years.\u201d Still, it\u2019s unclear whether those who have been immunized may still spread the virus to others. \u201cThe answer to that very important question\u201d should be known by mid-February, he said. Up to 15 percent of those receiving the shots experience \u201csignificant, not overwhelming\u201d pain at the injection site, which usually disappears in a day or two, Dr. Slaoui told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d also on Sunday. Operation Warp Speed was expected to have 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by December, a number that has since been slashed by more than half. Although the clinical trials were completed faster than expected because of the high level of virus transmission in the United States, manufacturing problems scaled down the expected number of available doses to 40 million. Safeguarding the vaccines are another matter, as the former U.S. cyber chief warned of attempts by several U.S. adversaries to steal intellectual property related to the vaccine. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have all been found to have been involved in \u201csome kind of espionage or spying, trying to get intellectual property related to the vaccine,\u201d said Christopher Krebs, who was until recently director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Speaking on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Krebs said that in his tenure, C.I.S.A. staff had been working on looking for \u201ccritical weak spots\u201d in vaccine makers\u2019 supply chains and public health institutions.",

    "article_text": "For Boris Johnson, a Week to Exorcise the Demons of 2020 LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s approval of a coronavirus vaccine this week, beating every other Western country, would be a political gift for any leader. But perhaps none needs it as much as Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A successful vaccine rollout could be the last chance for Mr. Johnson\u2019s government to show competence, after botching virtually every other step of its response to the pandemic, from tardy lockdowns to a costly, ineffective test-and-trace program \u2014 all of which contributed to the country having the highest death toll in Europe. It also comes just as Britain has reached a climactic stage in its long negotiations with the European Union for a trade relationship after having left the bloc this year. Allies of Mr. Johnson were quick to claim that the swift approval of the vaccine vindicated the Brexit project. That claim was quickly debunked. Nevertheless, the mass vaccination program will be an early test of how well Britain works once it is fully untethered from Europe. \u201cThe British government is looking for ways to claim a victory because they\u2019ve made such a bloody mess of the epidemic,\u201d said David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government who has become a vocal critic of its performance. \u201cThe nationalistic response is brutish and rather distasteful.\u201d Still, it is difficult to separate politics from public health. As the first vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine rolled into Britain in refrigerated trucks from Belgium this week, negotiators in London were in the last stages of trying to stitch together a long-term, E.U.-British trade agreement. The talks were paused on Friday evening, amid signs that a breakthrough would require personal intervention by Mr. Johnson. The pandemic has raised the pressure on him to strike a deal, since a failure could deepen the economic damage caused by multiple lockdowns. Yet the convergence of events could also be fortuitous, allowing the beleaguered prime minister to resolve an issue that has divided Britain for more than four years at the very moment that relief finally begins to arrive for a country ravaged by the virus. Pro-Brexit politicians struck a bluntly nationalistic chord, saying Britain\u2019s early approval of the vaccine was the first of many triumphs \u2014 though for all the fanfare, it may be only days ahead of U.S. authorization and a few weeks ahead of the European Union. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said Britain moved faster than its neighbors because \u201cwe\u2019re a much better country than every single one of them.\u201d The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said European regulators were \u201ca bit sniffy\u201d that they had not yet managed to approve it. \u201cWe have, we\u2019re leaving, draw your own conclusions,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe are now free of the dead hand of the European Union.\u201d In fact, the swift approval of the Pfizer vaccine was not enabled by Brexit. Although Britain formally left the European Union last January, it continues to adhere to the bloc\u2019s regulations until a transition period expires on Dec. 31. The British health regulator invoked an emergency power, available to all European Union members, to move faster in the case of a pandemic. Still, the optics of Britain striking out on its own, ahead of France and Germany, are appealing because they play into the pro-Brexit argument that a Britain unshackled from Brussels will be more agile and flexible, able to act as a free agent in the global market for everything from vaccines to ventilators. \u201cNo one is very proud of our record on the pandemic,\u201d said Jonathan Powell, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. \u201cBut they believe we\u2019re magically going to become a better country by being outside of Europe.\u201d If anything, Mr. Powell said, the Pfizer vaccine was a testament to the value of pre-Brexit, cross-border collaboration: It was developed by Turkish-born scientists at a German biotechnology firm, produced by an American pharmaceutical company and manufactured in a plant in Belgium. Brexit has colored Mr. Johnson\u2019s handling of the pandemic in ways obvious and subtle. Britain declined to join a multi-billion-dollar European Union vaccine purchasing fund and shunned a European consortium to buy ventilators. The latter decision provoked anxiety in the early days of the pandemic, when it looked as if hospitals might not have enough machines for their patients. In the end, the hospitals were able to cope with the demand. On Monday, Mr. Johnson boasted that Britain, acting on its own, was the first country to pre-order supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, securing 40 million doses. All told, it has ordered more than 350 million doses of seven vaccine candidates, hedging its bets in case some do not pan out. But Mr. Johnson diverged from other European leaders in waiting until late March to impose a lockdown. This fall, amid a second wave of the virus, he again moved more tentatively than leaders on the Continent, imposing a nationwide lockdown only in November. Critics say those delays cost lives; Britain\u2019s death toll just surpassed 60,000. \u201cWhile we were in lockdown, we appeared to do nothing about a test-trace-and-isolate system,\u201d Professor King said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a system that has anywhere near the capacity we need.\u201d He and other experts expressed less concern about the British regulator\u2019s rapid approval of the Pfizer vaccine. Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, they said, had a history of independence and a reputation across Europe for thoroughly vetting new drugs. They also expressed confidence that the vaccine will be distributed through Britain\u2019s National Health Service, not by private contractors, like the companies involved in the trouble-prone test-and-trace system. Even so, there are worries about how to distribute the vaccine, which needs to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Before the first injections, the government abruptly changed the priority for who would get the shot first, ruling out those in nursing homes in favor of nursing home staff and people 80 and over in hospitals or with appointments there. The government\u2019s muddled messaging has damaged Mr. Johnson, not just with the public but also with members of his own Conservative Party. He had to fend off a rebellion among Conservatives in Parliament this week over tiered restrictions that replaced the nationwide lockdown lifted on Tuesday. Experts said they were hopeful that the arrival of a vaccine would leach some of the vitriol out of the debate over lockdowns. But the government\u2019s messaging could be a weakness in winning broad public acceptance of the vaccine. In addition to anti-vaccination activists, experts said it would confront wariness from people who will question whether Britain rushed its approval. \u201cThey need to think about people who are saying, \u2018Why is this being pushed so quickly?\u2019\u201d said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health program at the University of Edinburgh, who added she would take it \u201ctomorrow, if I could.\u201d Mr. Johnson named Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of Parliament with a background in public-opinion research, to coordinate the deployment of the vaccine. Mr. Zahawi, who has a degree in chemical engineering, co-founded YouGov, an internet polling company, which he later sold. In YouGov\u2019s polling on the vaccine \u2014 conducted last month after Pfizer reported positive results in clinical trials \u2014 two-thirds of those surveyed said they were \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201cfairly likely\u201d to take the vaccine when it becomes available. A fifth said they were unlikely to take it, while 12 percent said they were not sure. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to see social influencers or health care workers lining up to take it,\u201d Professor Sridhar said.",

    "article_text": "The Elderly vs. Essential Workers: Who Should Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First? With the coronavirus pandemic surging and initial vaccine supplies limited, the United States faces a hard choice: Should the country\u2019s immunization program focus in the early months on the elderly and people with serious medical conditions, who are dying of the virus at the highest rates, or on essential workers, an expansive category encompassing Americans who have borne the greatest risk of infection? Health care workers and the frailest of the elderly \u2014 residents of long-term-care facilities \u2014 will almost certainly get the first shots, under guidelines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued on Thursday. But with vaccination expected to start this month, the debate among federal and state health officials about who goes next, and lobbying from outside groups to be included, is growing more urgent. It\u2019s a question increasingly guided by concerns over the inequities laid bare by the pandemic, from disproportionately high rates of infection and death among poor people and people of color to disparate access to testing, child care and technology for online schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s damnable that we are even being placed in this position that we have to make these choices,\u201d said the Rev. William J. Barber II, a co-chairman of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, a national coalition that calls attention to the challenges of the working poor. \u201cBut if we have to make the choice, we cannot once again leave poor and low-wealth essential workers to be last.\u201d Ultimately, the choice comes down to whether preventing death or curbing the spread of the virus and returning to some semblance of normalcy is the highest priority. \u201cIf your goal is to maximize the preservation of human life, then you would bias the vaccine toward older Americans,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said recently. \u201cIf your goal is to reduce the rate of infection, then you would prioritize essential workers. So it depends what impact you\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d The trade-off between the two is muddied by the fact that the definition of \u201cessential workers\u201d used by the C.D.C. comprises nearly 70 percent of the American work force, sweeping in not just grocery store clerks and emergency responders, but tugboat operators, exterminators and nuclear energy workers. Some labor economists and public health officials consider the category overbroad and say it should be narrowed to only those who interact in person with the public. Essential Frontline An independent committee of medical experts that advises the C.D.C. on immunization practices will soon vote on whom to recommend for the second phase of vaccination \u2014 \u201cPhase 1b.\u201d In a meeting last month, all voting members of the committee indicated support for putting essential workers ahead of people 65 and older and those with high-risk health conditions. Historically, the committee relied on scientific evidence to inform its decisions. But now the members are weighing social justice concerns as well, noted Lisa A. Prosser, a professor of health policy and decision sciences at the University of Michigan. \u201cTo me the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country,\u201d Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a committee member and a pediatrics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said at the time, \u201cand clearly favors the essential worker group because of the high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers among essential workers.\u201d That position runs counter to frameworks proposed by the World Health Organization, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and many countries, which say that reducing deaths should be the unequivocal priority and that older and sicker people should thus go before the workers, a view shared by many in public health and medicine. Dr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director and the nation\u2019s top public health official, reminded the advisory committee of the importance of older people, saying in a statement on Thursday that he looked forward to \u201cfuture recommendations that, based on vaccine availability, demonstrate that we as a nation also prioritize the elderly.\u201d Once the committee votes, Dr. Redfield will decide whether to accept its recommendations as the official guidance of the agency. Only rarely does a C.D.C. director reject a recommendation from the committee, whose 14 members are selected by the Health and Human Services secretary, serve four-and-a-half-year terms and have never confronted a task as high in profile as this one. But ultimately, the decision will be up to governors and state and local health officials. They are not required to follow C.D.C. guidelines, though historically they have done so. There are about 90 million essential workers nationwide, as defined by a division of the Department of Homeland Security that compiled a roster of jobs that help maintain critical infrastructure during a pandemic. That list is long, and because there won\u2019t be enough doses to reach everyone at first, states are preparing to make tough decisions: Louisiana\u2019s preliminary plan, for example, puts prison guards and food processing workers ahead of teachers and grocery employees. Nevada\u2019s prioritizes education and public transit workers over those in retail and food processing. At this early point, many state plans put at least some people who are older and live independently, or people who have medical conditions, ahead of most essential workers, though that could change after the C.D.C. committee makes a formal recommendation on the next phase. One occupation whose priority is being hotly debated is teaching. The C.D.C. includes educators as essential workers. But not everyone agrees with that designation. Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, argued that teachers should not be included as essential workers, if a central goal of the committee is to reduce health inequities. \u201cTeachers have middle-class salaries, are very often white, and they have college degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they should be treated better, but they are not among the most mistreated of workers.\u201d Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, disagreed. Teachers not only ensure that children don\u2019t fall further behind in their education, she said, but are also critical to the work force at large. \u201cWhen you talk about disproportionate impact and you\u2019re concerned about people getting back into the labor force, many are mothers, and they will have a harder time if their children don\u2019t have a reliable place to go,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you think generally about people who have jobs where they can\u2019t telework, they are disproportionately Black and brown. They\u2019ll have more of a challenge when child care is an issue.\u201d In September, academic researchers analyzed the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s list of essential workers and found that it broadly mirrored the demographics of the American labor force. The researchers proposed a narrower, more vulnerable category \u2014 \u201cfrontline workers,\u201d such as food deliverers, cashiers and emergency medical technicians, who must work face to face with others and are thus at greater risk of contracting the virus. By this definition, said Francine D. Blau, a labor economist at Cornell University and an author of the study, teachers belong in the larger category of essential workers. However, when they work in classrooms rather than remotely, she said, they would fit into the \u201cfrontline\u201d group. Individual states categorize teachers differently. Dr. Blau said that if supplies are short, frontline workers should be emphasized. \u201cThese are a subset of essential workers who, given the nature of their jobs, must provide their labor in person. Prioritizing them makes sense given the heightened risk that they face.\u201d The analysis, a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, is in line with other critics, who say that the list of essential workers is too wide-ranging. \u201cIf groups are too large, then you\u2019re not really focusing on priorities,\u201d said Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who worked on the vaccination frameworks for the W.H.O. and the National Academies. The essential workers on the federal list make up nearly 70 percent of the American labor force, the researchers said, compared with 42 percent for the frontline workers. Women made up 39 percent of frontline workers and, in certain occupations, far more. Frontline workers\u2019 education levels are lower, as are their wages \u2014 on average, just under $22 an hour. The proportion of Black and Hispanic workers is higher than in the broader category of essential workers. Some health policy experts said that to prioritize preventing deaths rather than reducing virus transmission was simply a pragmatic choice, because there won\u2019t be enough vaccine initially available to make a meaningful dent in contagion. A more effective use of limited quantities, they say, is to save the lives of the most frail. Moreover, vaccine trial results so far show only that the shots can protect the individuals who receive them. The trials have not yet demonstrated that a vaccinated person would not infect others. Though scientists believe that is likely to be the case, it has yet to be proved. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Harald Schmidt, an expert in ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said that it is reasonable to put essential workers ahead of older adults, given their risks, and that they are disproportionately minorities. \u201cOlder populations are whiter, \u201d Dr. Schmidt said. \u201cSociety is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.\u201d But to protect older people more at risk, he called on the C.D.C. committee to also integrate the agency\u2019s own \u201csocial vulnerability index.\u201d The index includes 15 measures derived from the census, such as overcrowded housing, lack of vehicle access and poverty, to determine how urgently a community needs health support, with the goal of reducing inequities. In a new analysis of the states\u2019 preliminary vaccine plans, Dr. Schmidt found that at least 18 states intended to apply the index. Tennessee, for one, has indicated that it will reserve some of its early allotments for disadvantaged communities. Still, some people believe it is wrong to give racial and socioeconomic equity more weight than who is most likely to die. \u201cThey need to have bombproof, fact-based, public-health-based reasons for why one group goes ahead of another,\u201d said Chuck Ludlam, a former Senate aide and biotech industry lobbyist who protested putting essential workers ahead of older people in comments to the committee. \u201cThey have provided no explanation here that will withstand public scrutiny.\u201d Further complicating matters, the different priority groups discussed by the C.D.C. committee are overlapping \u2014 many essential workers have high-risk conditions, and some are older than 65. Some states have suggested that they will prioritize only essential workers who come face to face with the public, while others have not prioritized them at all. Even some people whose allegiance lies with one group have made the case that others should have an earlier claim on the vaccine. Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 1.3 million grocery and food processing workers, said that despite the high rate of infection among his members, he thought that older adults should go first. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: Everybody\u2019s got a grandmother or grandfather,\u201d Mr. Perrone said. \u201cAnd I do believe almost everybody in this country would want to protect them, or their aging parents.\u201d But Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine\u2019s top public health official, said he respectfully disagreed, repeating the explanation he had given his in-laws \u2014 who are older but in good health and able to socially distance. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve told them: \u2018You know what? I\u2019m sorry, but there are others that I need to get this vaccine to first, so that when you guys get vaccinated, the world you come back into is ready to receive you.\u2019\u201d All these plans are, of course, unfurling with essential information still unknown.Many state officials said that as on-the-ground realities emerge, they fully expect their plans to evolve. One uncertainty: given the high rates of apprehension swirling around this vaccine, how many people in the early groups will actually line up for it? \u201cIf a high proportion of essential workers decline to get the vaccine, states will have to quickly move onto the next group anyway,\u201d said Dr. Prosser, the University of Michigan health analyst. \u201cBecause once the vaccines arrive, they will have to be used in a certain amount of time before they degrade.\" Additional work by Jugal K.

    "article_text": "\u2018Natural Immunity\u2019 From Covid Is Not Safer Than a Vaccine On the heels of last month\u2019s news of stunning results from Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s experimental Covid-19 vaccines, Senator Rand Paul tweeted a provocative comparison. The new vaccines were 90 percent and 94.5 percent effective, Mr. Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said. But \u201cnaturally acquired\u201d Covid-19 was even better, at 99.9982 percent effective, he claimed. Mr. Paul is one of many people who, weary of lockdowns and economic losses, have extolled the benefits of contracting the coronavirus. The senator was diagnosed with the disease this year and has argued that surviving a bout of Covid-19 confers greater protection than getting vaccinated. The trouble with that logic is that it\u2019s difficult to predict who will survive an infection unscathed, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. Given all of the unknowns \u2014 like a region\u2019s hospital capacity, or the strength of a person\u2019s immune response \u2014\u00a0choosing the disease over the vaccine is \u201ca very bad decision,\u201d she said. The primary advantage of a vaccine is that it\u2019s predictable and safe, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been optimally tailored to generate an effective immune response.\u201d But what do we know about how the immunity from a prior infection compares with the protection given by the new vaccines? And what if you have already had Covid \u2014 is it safe to be vaccinated? We asked experts to weigh in on the latest evidence. The short answer: We don\u2019t know. But Covid-19 vaccines have predictably prevented illness, and they are a far safer bet, experts said. Vaccines for some pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity than the natural infection does. Early evidence suggests that the Covid-19 vaccines may fall into this category. Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies \u2014 one marker of immune response \u2014 in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19. In other cases, however, a natural infection is more powerful than a vaccine. For example, having mumps \u2014 which can, in rare cases, cause fertility problems in men \u2014 generates lifelong immunity, but some people who have received one or two doses of the vaccine still get the disease. To Mr. Paul\u2019s point: Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection. But there is a \u201cmassive dynamic range\u201d in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels. In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. \u201cThose people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would,\u201d said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed. With a vaccine, everyone gets the same dose. \u201cWe know the dose that is being administered, and we know that that dose is effective at eliciting an immune response,\u201d Dr. Gommerman said. \u201cSo that becomes a variable that\u2019s taken off the table when you get the vaccine.\u201d The experts were unanimous in their answer: Covid-19 is by far the more dangerous option. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that one is less problematic for the body to recover from them than the other \u2014 there\u2019s more risk with natural infection,\u201d said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. People who are obese, or who have diseases like diabetes are particularly susceptible to severe cases of Covid-19. On average, the virus seems to be less risky for younger people, and women tend to fare better than men. But beyond those broad generalizations, doctors don\u2019t know why some people get very sick and die while others have no symptoms. For example, people who harbor certain mutations in immune genes are more susceptible to the disease, several studies have shown. \u201cSo there\u2019s a risk factor that has nothing to do with age,\u201d Dr. Gommerman said. In a study of more than 3,000 people, ages 18 to 34, who were hospitalized for Covid, 20 percent required intensive care and 3 percent died. \u201cIt\u2019s true that most people aren\u2019t going to be hospitalized, most people aren\u2019t going to get in the intensive care unit or die,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who represents the American Academy of Pediatrics at the meetings of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But \u201cnobody is immune to severe disease,\u201d she said. And even if people are not at high risk of Covid themselves, their friends or family could be. As many as one in three people who recover from Covid have chronic complaints, including exhaustion and a racing heart, for months afterward. This includes people under 35 with no previous health conditions. Some survivors of Covid also show troubling signs that their body has turned on itself, with symptoms similar to those of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Covid vaccines, in contrast, carry little known risk. They have been tested in tens of thousands of people with no serious side effects \u2014 at least so far. \u201cOnce you start vaccinating millions, you might find very, very rare events,\u201d Dr. Hanage said. \u201cBut we have to know that they are very, very rare and much more rare than the adverse events associated with natural infection.\u201d A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. It\u2019s safe, and probably even beneficial, for anyone who has had Covid to get the vaccine at some point, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing deleterious about getting a boost to an immune response that you\u2019ve had before,\u201d Dr. Pepper said. \u201cYou could get an actually even better immune response by boosting whatever immunity you had from the first infection by a vaccine.\u201d In fact, at a meeting on Wednesday, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said up to 10 percent of participants in clinical trials for the vaccines had been infected with the virus without knowing it. Their immune responses to the vaccine are being analyzed, he said. If you\u2019ve already had Covid-19, you can afford to wait awhile for the vaccine. Studies from Dr. Pepper\u2019s team and others have shown that the immune response evolves over the first few months after infection, but everyone who has had Covid has some level of protection during that time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see anybody who didn\u2019t develop some sort of an immune response,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think those people need to rush out and go get the vaccine in the same way that people who are highly susceptible really do.\u201d The A.C.I.P., which makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine distribution, said at a meeting on Wednesday that people who had not been infected should get priority over those who contracted the virus in the past 90 days. \u201cAt some point we\u2019ll need to figure out whether 90 days is the right number,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said. But for now, \u201cpeople who have evidence of infection recently should probably not be vaccinated at first in line because there\u2019s so little vaccine available.\u201d",

Vice President Mike Pence appeared at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday and said the nation was facing a \u201cchallenging time\u201d but also \u201ca season of hope,\u201d with the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine coming as soon as next week. \u201cThank you to the men and women of C.D.C. who have literally poured their lives over the last 10 months into saving lives across America,\u201d said Mr. Pence, who wore a mask during the visit. But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus. The agency also called for increased access to testing and quarantine for those who are exposed. Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers. Two days later, a committee of outside experts will convene to make recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration about whether to grant emergency approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that he would implore Americans to wear masks for a little more than three months toward the beginning of his term. \u201cJust 100 days to mask,\u201d Mr. Biden told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a significant reduction.\u201d  But until he is sworn in on Jan. 20, Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to take direct action is limited.",

    "article_text": "Why Melinda Gates Spends Time \u2018Letting My Heart Break\u2019 As the valedictorian of her Dallas high school, Melinda Gates delivered a graduation speech that included a quote attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson. \u201cTo know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived,\u201d she told her classmates, \u201cthis is to have succeeded.\u201d Decades later and billions of dollars wealthier, Ms. Gates says the quote is still ringing in her ears. \u201cThat\u2019s been my definition of success since high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if I have an extra dollar, or a thousand dollars, or a million dollars, or in my case, which is absurd, a billion dollars to plow back into making the world better for other people, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d As the wife of Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, Ms. Gates now has the capital, clout and connections to have an impact however she pleases. She is one of the richest people in the world, a leading voice in global health and an advocate for women\u2019s economic empowerment. As a face of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she is also a lightning rod for critics who say billionaires have too much sway over public policy, as well as for conspiracy theorists who harbor darker fantasies. The Gateses have been sounding the alarm about infectious diseases \u2014 and the need to fund vaccination efforts \u2014 since the late 1990s. That was when, during travels in Africa and India, the extreme poverty they saw prompted them to reflect on how they might use their wealth to make a difference. \u201cWe just kept saying: \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Why isn\u2019t the infrastructure here for roads? Why aren\u2019t we seeing more people who are doing well economically? What\u2019s happened?\u2019\u201d Ms. Gates said. \u201cWe started to think about what philanthropy\u2019s role might be and realized that the best place to intervene, if you want somebody to live a full and productive life, was to start with health.\u201d Since then, the Gates Foundation has given away more than $55 billion, much of it directed at efforts to eradicate disease in the developing world. It has helped to all but wipe out polio, and has poured money into programs aimed at ensuring that poor countries have easy access to vaccines. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the foundation turned its attention to the vast and complex project of developing vaccines for the new virus, and ensuring that they could be widely distributed. So far, the foundation has contributed nearly $500 million to coronavirus response efforts. Earlier investments by the foundation are paying off as well \u2014 one of the drugmakers it previously funded, BioNTech, has developed a successful Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer. Ms. Gates is more optimistic today than she was a couple months ago. Vaccines that appear to be safe and effective are beginning to be deployed. Treatments for the virus have improved. And President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made beating back the pandemic his top priority. \u201cThe Biden administration will re-enter the global stage and be a participant in making sure the whole world gets vaccines,\u201d Ms. Gates said. She added that the virus team assembled by Mr. Biden was \u201ca very strong, eminent group who are wise and thoughtful and very reasonable.\u201d Yet Ms. Gates was realistic about the challenges ahead. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, disinformation is running rampant on social media, many Americans still refuse to wear masks, and cases are surging again. \u201cWe still have a stretch of very dark months ahead of us,\" she said. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity. You and Bill have been warning about the risk of pandemics for a long time. How has the last year diverged from your expectations? You can project out and think about what a pandemic might be like or look like, but until you live through it, it\u2019s pretty hard to know what the reality will be like. So I think we predicted quite well that, depending on what the disease was, it could spread very, very, very quickly. The spread did not surprise us. What did surprise us is we hadn\u2019t really thought through the economic impacts. What happens when you have a pandemic that\u2019s running rampant in populations all over the world? The fact that we would all be home, and working from home if we were lucky enough to do that. That was a piece that I think we hadn\u2019t really prepared for. What do you think should have been done earlier at the start of the pandemic? We can look at how this disease traveled around the world and see that the countries who locked down first, they\u2019re doing better. Many African countries saw it coming and locked it down early. Their replication rate just never got as high as many other countries. And that is a good thing. We should have said sooner that if you\u2019re going to go out, wear a mask. I mean, the fact we\u2019re even still debating that in the United States makes zero sense. Most people get in a car today and know that to save their own life, they ought to wear a seatbelt. Most people would agree that having drunken drivers on the road is a bad thing, not only individually but for us as a society, because it causes more deaths. Well, masks are just the right thing to do right now. It is insane that we\u2019re at this point in this pandemic, in the United States, and we\u2019re still debating whether people should wear a mask when they go in a store to buy their groceries. What do you believe are going to be the most serious challenges to conducting an effective and comprehensive vaccination campaign in this country and around the world? We do know how to get the vaccine out, even in very remote circumstances. Some of the vaccines will be much harder than others and require very substantial cold chains, so those will be hard to get out around the globe. But there are vaccines coming right behind those, so I\u2019m quite optimistic. The disinformation has been incredibly harsh, and it affects people\u2019s lives. But I\u2019m also hopeful that as the vaccine comes out and people see that it\u2019s safe and efficacious, they will start to take it so that they can go out and return to normal. To what do you attribute the rise in vaccine hesitancy? Is it as simple as disinformation? I think, quite honestly, the advent of social media. If you\u2019re a conspiracy theorist and you get connected to somebody else who maybe has heard of the autism problem that didn\u2019t really exist, those things start to connect, and then those conspiracies start to replicate. We\u2019re at a point of a lot of distrust in the country and all over the world. We know people are more polarized. Disinformation is just too easy to spread, and that\u2019s going to cost people their lives. Say I start to believe PizzaGate and I start clicking all the theories of PizzaGate. What I\u2019m going to get served up on my social media channel is lots more things about conspiracy theories. And if I don\u2019t have anybody pushing back on that, and I\u2019m going down that wormhole, I\u2019m going to start to believe more and more and more disinformation. That\u2019s just not good for society. Between social media and people\u2019s own anxiety and the polarized nature of our country, all these pieces have combined to make sort of a perfect storm around vaccine hesitancy. Are there some people who will never get vaccinated, never wear a mask? Yes. We\u2019re already seeing that in places in the country. But I think the more important question is: Will there be a broad set of people that will take this vaccine? And I think the answer to that will be yes. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: You and Bill have been subject of conspiracy theories, too. Why do you think they\u2019ve targeted you specifically? I don\u2019t know. I just think that fear is there, and so people are looking to point to somebody or some thing or some institution. And then once it lands on that person or institution, you get sort of a pile-on effect because of social media, and it\u2019s deeply, deeply concerning for society. Our democracy depends on facts, and we depend on having real facts out there to keep ourselves safe and healthy. Do you believe that the Trump administration\u2019s politicization of the vaccine development process is contributing to that hesitancy? Absolutely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was set up to give scientific information and guidance to health commissioners in every region of the United States. That agency needs to be left to do its job in terms of real scientific fact. And same thing with the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A. is our gold standard. It\u2019s how we know our vaccines are safe and efficacious. So they need to be independent organizations and left as independent so that we can trust them. Unfortunately, the opposite of that has happened during this current administration. Do you believe the United States will be able to recover its leadership position in public health? People are looking to the U.S. and saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? What\u2019s going on?\u201d But I do believe our F.D.A. will hold. I do believe our C.D.C. will hold. I do believe the institutions we have will hold over the long term. I\u2019ve traveled to many different countries and seen where they don\u2019t have good governance or good institutions, or they don\u2019t have a free press. We are lucky to have those things in the United States. And, yes, they have been eroded to some extent, some of them, and, yes, our position in global leadership has people scratching their heads. Can it be built back? Yes. Definitely. Do you believe it\u2019s appropriate for drug makers to profit from the sale of vaccines in the midst of a pandemic? I think they should make a small profit, because we want them to stay in business. And at the end of the day, they are beholden to their shareholders. The question is how much profit. And I think during a pandemic like this, it should only be slightly above the marginal cost of the vaccine. Do you accept the line of criticism that says big philanthropy has too much power right now, that individuals, not governments, are making decisions that shape educational policy and public policy? I think that\u2019s a critique that is well worth listening to and looking at. In our philanthropic work, there isn\u2019t a single thing that we don\u2019t work on in partnership with governments. Because at the end of the day, it is governments that scale things up and that can help the most people. There is a healthy ecosystem that needs to exist between government, philanthropy, the private sector and civil society. And when you get that ecosystem working at its best, no one party in that ecosystem has too much power. You know, if Bill and I had had more decision-making authority in education, maybe we would\u2019ve gotten farther in the United States. But we haven\u2019t. Some of the things that we piloted or tried got rejected, or didn\u2019t work, and I think there\u2019s a very healthy ecosystem of parents and teachers\u2019 unions and mayors and city councils that make those education decisions. I wish the U.S. school system was better for all kids. Do you believe the tax code should be changed in ways that address some of the enormous economic disparities in this country? Bill and I completely agree if you\u2019re wealthy in this country, you benefited from the system, you benefited from the amazing infrastructure of the United States, and so you have an obligation to give back. And we don\u2019t have a tax policy that is appropriately taxing the wealthiest. I\u2019m not an expert on tax policy, but I will say this: A lot of wealthy people are making a lot off of their capital gains, versus their ordinary income. And I think that\u2019s one place we ought to look at tax policy. How do you reconcile the enormous privilege that you have with the acute suffering that so many people are experiencing right now? It\u2019s something I\u2019ve pondered a lot. There\u2019s no explanation how you get to be in this situation of privilege. There\u2019s just none. But I spend a lot of my waking hours, when we\u2019re not in a pandemic, traveling and meeting other people and doing what I call letting my heart break. I\u2019ve worked in Mother Teresa\u2019s home for the dying. I\u2019ve slept on people\u2019s farms in Africa. I do meditation every morning, and I\u2019ve had days of tears thinking about people I know who\u2019ve lost a loved one. It\u2019s going to those places where your heart really hurts for everybody, not just your own sense of loss. And so I cry a lot, and then I come back and I say, \u201cHow do I take what that person shared with me and what I learned, and how do I plow that back into the work to try and make the world better, or to convince a global leader that they ought to give more money to malaria, or care about people getting a vaccine on the other side of the world, or care about a child not getting a proper education in certain cities in the United States?\u201d I just try to constantly remember that it\u2019s a privilege.",

    "article_text": "Could a Blood Test Show if a Covid-19 Vaccine Works? A new study in monkeys suggests that a blood test could predict the effectiveness of a Covid-19 vaccine \u2014\u00a0and perhaps speed up the clinical trials needed to get a working vaccine to billions of people around the world. The study, published on Friday in Nature, reveals telltale blood markers that predict whether a monkey\u2019s immune system is prepared to wipe out incoming coronaviruses. The finding raises hope that researchers will be able to look for the same markers in people who get vaccines in clinical trials. If the markers are strong enough, they could reveal if the vaccines protect against Covid-19. And researchers would no longer have to wait for some trial volunteers to get the disease, as they do now. \u201cIt will pave the way for a much more rapid advancement of the Covid vaccine field,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and one of the researchers behind the new study. Last month brought the stunning news that clinical trials of two new coronavirus vaccines, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech, showed efficacy rates around 95 percent. The strength of these two vaccines is, paradoxically, bad news for the dozens of others in earlier stages of development. Many of them will most likely have to be compared against the robust front-runners rather than a placebo shot. Because that is a high statistical bar to clear, their trials will need a lot more volunteers, time and money. \u201cYou\u2019d have to follow millions of people for a long time,\u201d said Dr. Nelson Michael, the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where a protein-based vaccine is being prepared for clinical trials in early 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s just fantasy.\u201d For some smaller companies, these comparison trials may be deal-breakers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of dropout,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic. That\u2019s a big problem, because Pfizer and Moderna won\u2019t have nearly enough doses to give to everyone in the United States, let alone the world. And the next wave of vaccines may turn out to be superior to the first, in one way or the other. They could cost a lot less, for example. Some might come in just one dose instead of two, and won\u2019t need a deep freeze. Some might offer protection that lasts a lot longer. \u201cWe\u2019d rather not have to revaccinate the world every one or two years,\u201d Dr. Michael said. The new monkey study offers a ray of hope for these next-generation vaccines, suggesting that they could be tested not against older vaccines, but using a measurement known as a \u201ccorrelate of protection.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the holy grail of vaccine research,\u201d Dr. Michael said. Influenza vaccines are already tested this way. Every new flu season requires the design of a new flu shot, but researchers don\u2019t have to run clinical trials comparing it with old versions. Instead, they just check whether the new vaccine triggers a person\u2019s immune system to make enough of a certain kind of antibody against the flu. If it does, then researchers know the vaccine is adequately stimulating the immune system. If scientists could discover a correlate of protection against the coronavirus, they could follow the example of the flu. \u201cThat is an entirely plausible and feasible scenario,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said that basing clinical trials on correlates of protection \u2014\u00a0if they turn out to exist \u2014\u00a0\u201cpossibly could be considered in the future.\u201d A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. In their new study, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues found a correlate of protection in monkeys. They built the experiment on their previous research showing that once monkeys recover from Covid-19, they can resist a second infection. The scientists drew blood from these exposed animals and isolated an array of protective antibodies called IgG. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The researchers set out to see if there was a level of IgG that reliably protected monkeys from Covid-19. If the IgG antibodies produced by vaccines were above that level, the vaccines could be judged effective. To find that line, the researchers gave monkeys varying doses of antibodies, and then exposed them all to the coronavirus and watched how well they fought off the infection. In the monkeys with the weakest dose, the viruses multiplied much as they would in an ordinary animal. But the monkeys that got a medium dose produced far fewer viruses. Some of them were able to wipe out the viruses altogether. At the highest dose, the monkeys were completely protected. Until now, scientists relied on circumstantial evidence that suggested IgG antibodies were crucial to clearing coronavirus infections. The new study puts that idea to the test \u2014\u00a0and determines the threshold of IgG antibodies required to ward off an infection. \u201cThis is the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that we\u2019ve actually proven that antibodies protect,\u201d Dr. Barouch said. \u201cEverything else has been a statistical association.\u201d The experiment revealed that a modest amount of IgG antibodies turned out to be enough. That could be heartening news for vaccine developers, because even so-so vaccines may be able to cross the threshold. Researchers are now starting to review the results of vaccine clinical trials to see if a correlate of protection like the one identified by Dr. Barouch and his colleagues in monkeys exists in people. \u201cThe study bodes well for the upcoming immune correlates studies,\u201d said Holly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute in Seattle who was not involved in Dr. Barouch\u2019s study. Although it will take some time for those studies to produce solid results, Dr. Janes said preliminary hints made her optimistic. \u201cThe emerging data do suggest that we could be gleefully surprised,\u201d she said.

    "first_p": "Health care workers. Essential workers. Nursing home residents. New Yorkers who live in the hardest-hit neighborhoods.",
    "article_text": "Which New Yorkers Will Be First to Get the Virus Vaccine? Health care workers. Essential workers. Nursing home residents. New Yorkers who live in the hardest-hit neighborhoods. These are among the different groups that the public health authorities in New York want to prioritize for coronavirus vaccination. On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that the state would receive its first batch of the vaccine \u2014 170,000 doses from the drug maker Pfizer \u2014 on Dec. 15, pending federal approval. New York City anticipates receiving around 480,000 doses by the beginning of January, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday. Bill Neidhardt, the spokesman, said about roughly half would be Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and half would be from Moderna, another drug maker. Mr. Cuomo said he was unsure when the vaccine would be widely available. The uncertainty surrounding availability will be just one element of what is shaping up to be the greatest mass vaccination campaign in the United States in at least the last half century. Pfizer has said it expects to have produced about 25 million doses for the American market by the end of the year, while Moderna has said it expects to produce more than 20 million doses. A total of 45 million doses would be enough for 22.5 million people, since each person requires two doses, separated by a few weeks. Mr. Cuomo said the first batch from Moderna should arrive later this month. Both companies still need F.D.A. approval. The federal government has said the initial doses will be distributed to states based on the size of their adult population.  While the C.D.C. will offer a broad framework for which groups to prioritize, there is considerable room for New York State and New York City to make their own decisions. Hospitals are already preparing to receive their first shipments, even if they don\u2019t know how many doses they will get. Northwell Health, the state\u2019s largest hospital system, was told it would receive 48 hours\u2019 notice before its first allotment of the Pfizer vaccine shipped from a distribution center in Michigan, according to Onisis Stefas, the hospital system\u2019s chief pharmacy officer. The vaccine would arrive in a suitcase-sized box, packed with dry ice. Inside, a smaller box would contain the frozen vaccine vials. There was so much uncertainty that Dr. Stefas said he was unsure whether to use those doses quickly, or reserve half to use as the second dose. An advisory committee to the C.D.C. on Tuesday recommended that the first people to receive the vaccine should be health care workers, along with nursing home residents and staff. Mr. Neidhardt, the spokesman for the mayor, said the 480,000 expected doses would be given to health care personnel performing high-risk activities, like working on coronavirus floors at hospitals, and people living and working in nursing homes.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to protect health care workers so they can continue to go to work and take care of the sick,\u201d said Jessica Justman, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. Nursing home residents are being prioritized for a different reason: They are at high risk of dying from the coronavirus. Residents and staff of long-term care facilities account for about 40 percent of the deaths attributed to the virus in the United States. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo and his aides said the first shipments of the vaccine would go to nursing home residents and staff, as well as frontline health care workers. (A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and initial shipments of the Moderna vaccine would arrive later in December, the governor\u2019s office said.) There are about 85,000 residents of nursing homes, according to the governor\u2019s office, and the state has told the C.D.C. that there are more than \u201c800,000 critical health care workers.\u201d That includes home health care aides and staff members in hospitals, nursing homes and ambulance companies. In all, that is more than 4 percent of the state\u2019s population. There is likely some overlap between the 480,000 doses New York City expects to receive and the 170,000 doses Mr. Cuomo described Wednesday. Getting through the high-priority groups could take some time, experts said. Hospitals are already deciding which employees are eligible to be vaccinated once the first shipments come in.  Mount Sinai Health System, for example, will include some janitors and food delivery personnel who work in the emergency department and intensive care units among the health care workers slated to receive some of the earliest doses, said Susan Mashni, the chief pharmacy officer of the system. New York State has told the C.D.C. that the next groups to be \u201ctargeted\u201d for the vaccine will be \u201cother frontline essential workers, medically high risk individuals and individuals over 65.\u201d In a draft plan that the state released publicly in October, more than a dozen categories of people were put in one of five priority groups. Grocery store workers were ahead of \u201cindividuals under 65 with high-risk comorbidities,\u201d who were in turn ahead of certain groups of essential workers. Mr. Cuomo has also been expressing concern that low-income and minority areas could be underserved by the vaccines, a point he reiterated on Wednesday, saying the federal vaccination plan \u201coverlooks the Black, brown, and poor communities.\u201d A draft plan that New York City filed with the C.D.C. raised the possibility that race would factor into the city\u2019s vaccination plans. Black and Hispanic New Yorkers have died of the virus at a disproportionate rate. The draft stated that \u201cvaccine planning and allocation decisions must be made through an anti-racist and intersectional lens.\u201d What that means in practice remains unclear. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would prioritize vaccination for residents of some 27 neighborhoods that had been disproportionately hard hit in the spring. Many of those neighborhoods have predominately Black or Hispanic residents, one city official said. But the official added that the plans largely depended on how much of the vaccine the city received in the coming months. In the past, the city has released lists of neighborhoods it has deemed particularly hard-hit. These priority categories encompass millions of people across the state. But it is unclear when the vaccine will be widely available for everyone. By early next year, Pfizer and Moderna may be able to ship about 70 million doses a month, a top federal vaccine official told The Washington Post. Other vaccines may also be approved by then. It\u2019s possible that Americans who don\u2019t fit any specialized category may be receiving vaccines in the spring. There is so much uncertainty, and some of that is unavoidable. But there is also a growing sense that the authorities could be providing a clearer picture of what to expect. \u201cWhatever the plan is, it hasn\u2019t been shared really with the public,\u201d said James Krellenstein, an H.I.V. activist and an organizer of a coalition of health care workers and advocates called the Covid-19 Working Group-New York. He worried that the confusion and lack of information would contribute to \u201cpeople not feeling they\u2019re getting their fair place in the line.\u201d The city\u2019s provisional plans call for relying in part on the existing vaccine distribution infrastructure, which includes doctor\u2019s offices and pharmacies. That means many New Yorkers might be getting their Covid-19 vaccine at the nearest CVS. That posed a potential problem: Asking people to wait at the pharmacy counter could lead to more transmission. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people crowding indoors together,\u201d Professor Justman said, noting that outdoor vaccination sites made a lot of sense in this pandemic. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at very low temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius. Hospital systems have been buying new ultracold freezers in preparation and locating existing ones in their research labs.  And they have started to prepare for what to do the minute their first shipments arrive. \u201cWe\u2019re told we have a minute to unload it from the special box to the freezer,\u201d said Dr. Mashni. Already, the city\u2019s Health Department is asking hospitals to regularly report the temperatures in their ultracold freezers to make sure they can maintain temperatures at least as cold as minus 70 degrees indefinitely. But the vaccination can be kept at more ordinary temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius during the five days leading up to its use, according to Pfizer. The demanding cold-storage requirements for the Pfizer vaccine may lead it to be largely steered toward cities early on, further determining who ends up getting that vaccine in New York. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably going to make sense that the Moderna vaccine goes to rural areas, and that the Pfizer vaccine is directed to large institutions,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Farber, an infectious disease expert at Northwell Health and a member of a state task force that will review the vaccines.",

    "article_text": "The Winds Have Shifted in Pandemic Aid Negotiations WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory and faster-than-expected breakthroughs on a coronavirus vaccine have shifted the dynamics of stimulus talks in Congress, leading to the first serious bipartisan negotiations in months and empowering rank-and-file lawmakers who have long agitated for a compromise. With many cities and states reinstating lockdowns and the pace of job creation slowing, congressional lawmakers and Mr. Biden are facing pressure to provide a financial lifeline to the economy until a widespread vaccine forces the virus into submission. Mr. Biden has used public appearances in recent days to encourage lawmakers to compromise on a quick aid package that he said would only be a \u201cdown payment\u201d on what the incoming administration believes is necessary to mitigate the nation\u2019s economic pain in the months ahead. His team has pushed for Democrats to move off their hard-line negotiating stance for a trillion-dollar-plus bill, a stance that had made discussions with Republicans a nonstarter, and to embrace a smaller, bipartisan proposal. \u201cI think it should be passed,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the $908 billion proposal in a CNN interview broadcast Thursday evening, though he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask for more help when we get there to get things done.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced such a shift on Wednesday, throwing their support behind a bipartisan $908 billion outline as a baseline for restarting negotiations. The plan, which rank-and-file lawmakers are still finalizing, would provide aid through March, offering a new wave of aid to small businesses and the unemployed, helping state and local governments and temporarily shielding businesses from some lawsuits amid the pandemic. In a sign of momentum, more Republicans also began coalescing around the $908 billion framework as a baseline for restarting negotiations, which had collapsed over disagreements about size and scope. On Thursday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, spoke for the first time since the November election about another relief package, along with the spending bills needed to avert a government shutdown on Dec. 11. Mr. McConnell later told reporters that he and Ms. Pelosi are \u201cboth interested in getting an outcome\u201d on the two issues. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more hopeful that we\u2019ll get a bill,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He told reporters that he supported the bipartisan framework and that he had discussed coronavirus relief with President Trump at the White House on Thursday. But he added a dose of skepticism, given Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to circulate a blueprint for a smaller relief package. \u201cI will support what Senator McConnell wants to propose,\u201d Mr. Graham said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have any Democratic support. I\u2019m tired of doing show votes here.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, along with Democrats on Capitol Hill, have become alarmed at the possibility that the economy could slip back into recession in the new year, as small businesses shutter and government benefits expire for millions of workers, handing him an even bigger economic challenge. But Mr. Biden is walking a delicate path in moving toward a possible compromise. He has called publicly for an immediate deal to provide more economic aid, even before he becomes president, and spoken favorably about the bipartisan framework. But he has not directly injected himself into talks between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell, as some lawmakers and aides stressed that any immediate deal would need Mr. Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 not Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cThe president-elect has been very clear in stating that something needs to happen, that the American people need relief,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia and one of several House lawmakers who have worked on compromise legislation in an effort to break through the impasse. When asked if Mr. Biden should be more involved, she said she believed it better for Mr. Biden to play a supporting role while Mr. Trump remained president. \u201cHe will not be president until Jan. 20 \u2014 we can\u2019t wait until Jan. 20,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. He\u2019s not yet the president.\u201d The question of whether Mr. Trump would support a final compromise remains a wild card. Asked Thursday whether he agreed with Mr. McConnell that pandemic relief was \u201cin sight\u201d and whether he would support \u201cthis bill,\u201d Mr. Trump answered affirmatively. \u201cI will, and I think we are getting very close,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. While it was initially unclear which bill Mr. Trump was willing to sign, the White House later clarified that it was the outline of the smaller Republican bill, which Mr. McConnell is backing. Unlike in the fall, when both Republicans and Democrats had political incentives not to cut a deal, statements by Mr. Biden and his congressional allies in recent days show that lawmakers now see compromise as in their best interests. Depending on the outcome, stimulus plans could become a key issue in the Georgia runoff elections that will decide Senate control in January. Even with the renewed movement, a deal is far from assured. Mr. McConnell, who has continuously criticized the Democrats as wanting too expensive a package, acknowledged that it had been \u201cheartening to see a few hopeful signs\u201d this week in negotiations. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of endorsing the compromise plan in remarks on Thursday, admonishing lawmakers to focus on policy provisions where there was substantial agreement and signaling that he would not be quick to move off his targeted proposal. Even as he declared \u201ccompromise is within reach,\u201d he did not explicitly comment on the bipartisan framework. It also remains unclear what top Democrats would insist on in any final bill. But lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill acknowledged that a devastating spike in coronavirus cases across the country helped fuel momentum behind the discussions. Even a smaller, more immediate deal would fund an imminent distribution of a vaccine \u2014 a prospect that emerged after the election \u2014 and leave open the possibility for another relief package under a Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of the logistical costs and difficulties of vaccine distribution and the dramatic spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths every day,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, a longtime close ally of Mr. Biden\u2019s who is involved in the discussions. \u201cIt is clear, to everyone I think, that we are in for a very hard winter before the vaccine is broadly available.\u201d Discussions toward a possible deal began among a loose bipartisan group of senators in mid-November, according to four officials familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks who requested anonymity to describe them. The participants agreed to meet over dinner at the Capitol Hill home of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Nov. 17, two weeks after Election Day, to see if they could cobble together a plan. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, picked up the tab for food and drinks from San Lorenzo, a favorite of Washington\u2019s political class for Tuscan food. Fresh off a come-from-behind victory in Maine, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, agreed to co-host. They were joined by three more Senate Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the party\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 as well as two more Senate Republicans, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah. The conversation was productive enough that it quickly spilled into a nearly daily series of Zoom sessions that continued \u2014 sometimes for hours at a time \u2014 through the Thanksgiving holiday. Pleased at their progress, senators involved dryly dubbed themselves \u201cthe dinner group.\u201d Party leadership was kept informed, but senators did most of the negotiating themselves. Despite his more junior Senate status, Mr. Romney, his party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emerged early on as a driver of the talks with Mr. Warner. He insisted that Republicans could go no higher than roughly $900 billion in new spending \u2014 a number that Ms. Collins floated as a possible compromise figure \u2014 and that liability protections for employers would have to be included in some form. The proposal was made final Monday night over a pizza dinner hosted by Mr. Romney in an oversize hearing room. It would provide $300 a week in additional benefits to the unemployed for 18 weeks, after a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapsed in July. It includes $288 billion for struggling small businesses, restaurants and theaters and $160 billion for strapped cities and states, and most likely will include some liability protections for businesses. The framework, unveiled Tuesday, quickly received a boost from Mr. Biden. And speaking Thursday on CNN, he noted that he had faith in Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Coons to resolve the impasse, adding that he was \u201crelying on their judgment\u201d in determining \u201cthe most basic things that are needed now.\u201d Luke Broadwater, Thomas Kaplan and Michael D.

Among the abuses was the 40-year-long Tuskegee study in which officials from the U.S. Public Health Service allowed Black men infected with syphilis to go untreated. Mr. Obama also discussed the disproportionate number of coronavirus cases and deaths among Black, Hispanic and Native American people. Black and Latino residents are about three times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus and about twice as likely to die from it. It could take until May or June, according to federal officials, for a vaccine to become more widely available to the general public beyond those who are most at-risk and certain priority groups such as health care workers. President Bush\u2019s chief of staff, Freddy Ford, told CNN on Thursday that the former president had reached out to public health officials to see how he could help promote the vaccine. \u201cFirst, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations,\u201d Mr. Ford told the news outlet. \u201cThen, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera.\u201d President Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Angel Urena, told CNN that the former president would also be willing to take the vaccine publicly as soon as it was available to him. \u201cAnd he will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same,\u201d he said.

    "article_text": "Facebook says it will remove coronavirus vaccine misinformation. Facebook on Thursday said it would remove posts that contain claims about Covid-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts, as the social network acts more aggressively to bat down coronavirus misinformation while falsehoods run rampant. The move goes a step beyond how Facebook had handled misinformation about other kinds of vaccines. The company had previously made it more difficult to find vaccine misinformation that was not related to the coronavirus by \u201cdownranking\u201d it, essentially making it less visible in people\u2019s news feeds. But Facebook said it planned to take down Covid-19 vaccine falsehoods entirely if the claims had been discredited or contradicted by health groups including the World Health Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThis is another way that we are applying our policy to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cThis could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines.\u201d Facebook added that it would also take down \u201cfalse claims that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn\u2019t on the official vaccine ingredient list.\u201d The social network has long been hesitant to wade into the fraught space of determining what is true or false information on its platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has made it clear he \u201cdoes not want to be the arbiter of truth\u201d of what is posted on the site. But Mr. Zuckerberg has also taken an active role in combating the spread of coronavirus misinformation. Facebook has created new products and tools to inform the public about the potential dangers of the virus. Mr. Zuckerberg emailed Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection disease expert, as early as March to offer his help in fighting the virus. Dr. Fauci has since appeared on multiple live-streamed interviews on Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg. Because of the novelty of Covid-19 vaccines, not all false claims may be taken down immediately, Facebook said. The social network said it also plans to continue sending people to its Covid-19 Information Center, which contains verified and up-to-date information about the virus. Facebook\u2019s decision to remove vaccine-related misinformation is not without precedent. The company previously removed misinformation about the polio vaccine in Pakistan, as well as misinformation on the measles vaccine in Samoa during outbreaks of the illnesses.",

    "article_text": "U.K. and U.S. Officials Spar Over \u2018Vaccine Nationalism\u2019 LONDON \u2014 British and American officials sparred on Thursday over how Britain had beaten the United States to authorizing a coronavirus vaccine, a debate touching on politics and regulatory styles that has heated up as wealthy countries vie to receive the first shipments of vaccines. In Britain, the euphoria of winning the global race to authorizing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was quickly giving way to a more sober realization of the choices facing the country\u2019s National Health Service as it tries to deliver the first doses into people\u2019s arms by Monday. Nursing home residents, who had been named the government\u2019s top priority, have fallen down the list. Doctors and nurses were expecting to be vaccinated first, but those plans appeared to be in flux. Meanwhile, the government pleaded with people not to call hospitals, asking for a shot. The question of whether Britain had authorized a vaccine in haste on Wednesday, or the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 1,500 Americans a day, has divided scientists and has also drawn in politicians. Facing criticism from American and European regulators, British officials boasted of the decision on Thursday, with one lawmaker suggesting the Europeans were \u201ca bit sniffy\u201d and others misleadingly crediting Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got the best medical regulators,\u201d Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said in a radio interview, by way of explaining why Britain had become the first Western country to authorize a vaccine. \u201cMuch better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn\u2019t surprise me at all because we\u2019re a much better country than every single one of them, aren\u2019t we.\u201d Those remarks drew eye rolls from British scientists, but also provoked more serious concerns that any chest-beating by government ministers risked undermining the public\u2019s faith in a vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that British regulators had not scrutinized data from clinical trials as carefully as their American counterparts in the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cWe have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the F.D.A.,\u201d Dr. Fauci said in an interview on Fox News. \u201cThe U.K. did not do it as carefully and they got a couple of days ahead.\u201d Approval could come as early as next week from the F.D.A., and at the end of the month from European Union regulators. Pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have incorrectly cast Britain\u2019s split with the European Union as the reason it authorized a vaccine first. In fact, Britain remains under the bloc\u2019s regulatory umbrella until Dec. 31 when it comes to drug and vaccine approvals, but was able to move more quickly because of European regulations enabling countries to act independently in public health emergencies. While as a political matter, Brexit may have made it easier for Britain to authorize the vaccine early, analysts said, the divorce has made the job of its medical regulators more difficult in other ways. And the flag-waving of pro-Brexit lawmakers was doing little to engender public trust in vaccines, scientists said. \u201cVaccine nationalism has no place in Covid or other public health matters of global significance,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a scientific adviser to the British government. \u201cScience has always been the exit strategy from this horrendous pandemic \u2014 that science has been global.\u201d With the first inoculations just a few days away, Britons were parsing the government\u2019s shifting and sometimes vague statements about who would get the vaccine and when.  A government advisory committee had recommended that nursing home residents and workers be first in line for the vaccine, to prevent suffering and deaths among the most vulnerable and to protect the country\u2019s overburdened hospitals as they deal with a second wave of infections. More than a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales have happened in nursing homes. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that the Pfizer vaccine, owing to its ultracold storage needs, would only be administered in hospitals for the time being, ruling out nursing home residents as the first recipients. \u201cWe\u2019re all sat in this sort of limbo of, \u2018Are we getting it? Aren\u2019t we getting it?\u2019\u201d said Adam Purnell, an administrator at Kepplegate, a small nursing home in northwestern England.  \u201cIt just breaks my heart the stories I am hearing of not being able to see their loved ones,\u201d he added. \u201cTo have another promise crumble underneath them is quite insensitive to those people that live in care homes and their relatives.\u201d Roughly 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with BioNTech, a German company, were being packaged at the company\u2019s Belgian manufacturing plant this week for shipment to Britain. How and when they will arrive was being kept secret for security reasons, the company said, though the BBC reported on Thursday that some of the doses were being transported through the Eurotunnel between France and Britain Pfizer sought to shut down questions this week about whether people in Britain would be able to pay to cut the line for inoculation, which requires two doses, given a month apart. \u201cI can say clearly and confidently that there are no plans to supply the private sector for the foreseeable future \u2014 no chance at all,\u201d Ben Osborn, Pfizer\u2019s Britain country manager, said on Wednesday, adding that for the sake of equity, the public National Health Service would decide whom to vaccinate. And despite the predictions of some analysts that a black market in vaccines was inevitable, Mr. Osborn insisted that people trying to sell the shot without authorization would not be able to divert doses from its supply chain. As for the National Health Service\u2019s plans, hospitals had been sending internal emails in recent days outlining plans for scheduling shots for doctors and nurses. A government advisory committee has suggested that older or more vulnerable health workers, and doctors and nurses who work with fragile patients, would be among the first in line. The logistics of moving, defrosting and preparing the vaccine were so complicated, the government said, that it would only be given at 50 British hospitals to begin with. But by Thursday, there were indications that before health workers were vaccinated, the government wanted to offer shots to nursing home workers and people age 80 and over who were already coming to hospitals for other reasons. It still appeared likely that doctors and nurses would be among those receiving vaccines in the coming weeks. Sally Gilbert, an anesthetic technician who has been working on the coronavirus ward at a hospital in Hull, in northeast England, said she was relieved to hear of a vaccine being authorized. \u201cI hope this helps us get back to some kind of normality,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever that is.\u201d Though details were scarce about how vaccinations would work at her hospital, she said she had received an email suggesting that staff members could begin getting shots on Monday.  \u201cI\u2019m sure they have a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just haven\u2019t told us yet.\u201d Megan Specia contributed reporting from London.",

Josh Corman, a coronavirus strategist at the cybersecurity agency, said in a statement that the IBM report was a reminder of the need for \u201ccybersecurity diligence at each step in the vaccine supply chain.\u201d He urged organizations \u201cinvolved in vaccine storage and transport to harden attack surfaces, particularly in cold storage operation.\u201d Researchers for IBM Security X-Force, the company\u2019s cybersecurity arm, said they believed that the attacks were sophisticated enough that they pointed to a government-sponsored initiative, not a rogue criminal operation aimed purely at monetary gain. But they could not identify which country might be behind them. No matter who conducted the attacks, they underscore how everything about coronavirus vaccines \u2014 how to make them, test them and move them \u2014 has become vital information around the globe. A year ago, nations including Russia and China were focusing their covert efforts on stealing secrets about hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence advances; six months ago, intelligence agencies shifted their focus to obtaining, or defending, proprietary vaccine research. With several vaccines on the verge of moving from clinical trials into wider use, the IBM discovery suggests that the main target of state-employed hackers is now the infrastructure of delivering the vaccines to billions of people around the globe. The cyberattackers \u201cwere working to get access to how the vaccine is shipped, stored, kept cold and delivered,\u201d said Nick Rossmann, who leads IBM\u2019s global threat intelligence team. \u201cWe think whoever is behind this wanted to be able to understand the entire cold chain process.\u201d There is no indication so far that the attackers were aiming at Pfizer or Moderna, whose vaccines are expected to be the first ones approved for emergency use in the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer said Wednesday that the company\u2019s cold storage equipment was designed by security-conscious experts and custom-built to match the specific requirements of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, which must be stored at extremely cold temperatures. Many of the approaches came in the form of \u201cspear phishing\u201d emails that impersonated an executive at a major Chinese company, Haier Biomedical, which is a legitimate participant in the distribution chain. The email says \u201cwe want to place an order with your company,\u201d and includes a draft contract containing malware that would give the attackers access to the network. Outside experts said they doubted the attacks came from China, which has been accused of trying to steal vaccine information from universities, hospitals and medical researchers, because it would be unlike Chinese hackers to impersonate executives at a major Chinese firm. If they are correct, the lead suspects would be hackers in Russia and North Korea, both of which have also been accused by the United States of conducting attacks to steal information about the process of manufacturing and distributing vaccines. Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between official hacking operations for the Russian or North Korean governments and those run for private gain. The motive is also unclear. The attackers may simply be looking to steal technology to move large amounts of vaccine across long distances at extraordinarily low temperatures, which would constitute a classic form of intellectual property theft. But some cybersecurity experts say they suspect something more nefarious: efforts to interfere with the distribution, or ransomware, in which the vaccines would be essentially held hostage by hackers who have gotten into the system that runs the distribution network and locked it up \u2014 and who demand a large payment to unlock it. \u201cThere is no intelligence advantage in spying on a refrigerator,\u201d said James Lewis, who runs the cybersecurity programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cMy suspicion is that they are setting up for a ransomware play. But we won\u2019t know how these stolen credentials will be used until after the vaccine distribution begins.\u201d The IBM researchers provided an account of their efforts in an interview before the company posted its findings. They said the attackers sent out various requests for price and product information, some purportedly on behalf of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries. Many of the targets were in Asia, but some were European, including the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union. IBM noted that the organization has \u201cdirect ties to multiple national government networks,\u201d showing that the attackers had a sophisticated understanding of how to identify targets that could get them into many nations. But other organizations were also targeted, like Taiwan, South Korea, Germany and Italy. Some were involved in the solar panel-driven cooling systems for the vaccine. The attackers\u2019 emails were addressed to companies that provide key components of the cold chain process. Those include ice-lined boxes for vaccines and the solar panels that can power refrigerated vaccine containers \u2014 an important feature in poor countries where electricity can be scarce. The researchers said the effort seemed aimed at stealing credentials that could have ultimately led the attackers to a trove of information, including timetables for vaccine distribution, lists of vaccine recipients and where doses are being shipped. IBM could not determine whether the attacks were successful, the company said. The researchers said the attackers targeted one Gavi program started in 2015, before the advent of the coronavirus, to upgrade cold chain equipment for vaccines in dozen of nations. UNICEF, which is planning vaccine delivery for poorer countries, appears to have been another target. Najwa Mekki, a spokeswoman for the organization, said the IBM researchers alerted officials to the threat to the cold chain system, and \u201cwe notified our supply networks and alerted relevant teams to the need to increase vigilance.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "Why the U.K. Approved a Coronavirus Vaccine First LONDON \u2014 The first rigorously tested coronavirus vaccine was given a green light for use on Wednesday in Britain. Doses of the vaccine, made by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a small German company, BioNTech, will be injected starting next week, the government said. In leaping ahead of the United States to allow mass inoculations, Britain added to the pressure on American drug regulators, who were summoned to the White House on Tuesday by President Trump\u2019s chief of staff to explain why they were not ready to do the same. The two countries vet vaccines differently. Rather than accepting the findings of vaccine makers, American regulators painstakingly reanalyze raw data from the trials to validate the results, poring over what regulators have described as thousands of pages of documents. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on Tuesday that the F.D.A. \u201cis one of the few regulatory agencies in the world that actually looks at the raw data.\u201d Regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe lean more heavily on companies\u2019 own analyses. Instead of sifting through raw trial data and crunching the numbers themselves, regulatory agencies often will study a drugmaker\u2019s reports and, unless there are anomalies, ground their decisions in company-provided documents. The question of whether Britain had authorized a vaccine in haste, or the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 1,500 Americans a day, provoked a spirited debate among scientists and industry experts on Wednesday. European regulators said that Britain\u2019s authorization was so limited that it only applied to specific batches of the vaccine, a claim that Pfizer denied, and that British officials did not address. Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the F.D.A.\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, said in an interview on Wednesday that regulators\u2019 success in approving vaccines, while minimizing unforeseen errors, justified a rigorous approach. \u201cThat we\u2019ve been able to get on top of viruses with such a minimal amount of casualties is remarkable,\u201d he said, adding that American regulators were only days away from finishing their own review. The F.D.A. has scheduled a meeting of an independent panel of experts for Dec. 10 to review Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. British regulators seek opinions from a specialist committee, too, but that group has the flexibility to review data and meet as it needs to, allowing it to move more quickly. \u201cIn the U.K., they\u2019ve just been able to say, \u2018We have the data, we\u2019re having the meeting,\u2019\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. To speed the process, Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency had its experts review vaccine data as it became available, and separate teams worked in parallel on different parts of the process, rather than one waiting for another to finish. \u201cIf you\u2019re climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare,\u201d Dr. June Raine, the agency\u2019s chief executive, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe started that in June.\u201d When early results arrived on Nov. 10, she said, \u201cWe were at base camp.\u201d And later, she said, \u201cWhen we got the final analysis, we were ready for that last sprint.\u201d Britain broke from the European Union\u2019s regulatory orbit to approve a vaccine early, owing to emergency powers that the bloc gives countries in the case of a pandemic. Once Britain consummates its split from the European Union on Dec. 31, those powers to approve vaccines on its own will become permanent. The countries that remain in the European Union are waiting for its regulator, the European Medicines Agency, to authorize a vaccine. Like the F.D.A., the European regulator has scheduled a Dec. 29 meeting to consult outside experts and offer an opinion on the Pfizer vaccine. The agency\u2019s job is complicated by its obligation to solicit the views of all 27 E.U. countries. That process has been accelerated during the pandemic, but it will still take several days for countries to weigh in after the meeting, which is likely to delay vaccinations until early January. Pfizer plans to ship 800,000 doses to Britain in the coming days. Starting Tuesday night, those doses were being prepared for shipping at a factory in Puurs, Belgium, BioNTech said. The doses will be packaged in boxes, with dry ice keeping them at the South Pole-like temperatures they require, before they are put on trucks or planes and taken to Britain. They will arrive in government distribution warehouses by the weekend, Pfizer said on Wednesday. British hospitals have already begun emailing staff members to schedule vaccinations, with a London hospital system indicating that its first doses will be given at 7 a.m. on Monday. Britain placed advance orders for 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine but most of those are expected to be administered next year. Each patient needs two, a month apart. A government advisory body released its list of vaccine priority groups on Wednesday. At the top of the list are nursing home residents and workers, followed by people older than 80 and health and social care workers. In practice, though, government officials said on Wednesday that, because of the difficulties of storing and moving the Pfizer vaccine, they would initially restrict vaccinations to a network of 50 hospitals. As a result, nurses, doctors, nursing home staff and people age 80 or over who had scheduled appointments would be first in line for the vaccine, ahead of nursing home residents. Pfizer has said that the vaccine can survive for five days in a normal refrigerator. But Britain\u2019s National Health Service still has to consider issues like staffing at non-hospital sites and transport difficulties within the country in deciding how to administer the vaccine. The National Health Service has roughly 150,000 doctors and more than 330,000 nurses and midwives. The British decision will not in itself bring vaccinations closer anywhere else. But Pfizer executives said on Wednesday that they had already heard from other countries that, in light of Britain\u2019s go-ahead, were looking to accelerate their own approval processes. American regulators, despite months of pressure from Mr. Trump, have maintained that they will follow their plan and review Pfizer\u2019s vaccine to the F.D.A.\u2019s standards. The United States has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most of its supply will come from a separate factory in Kalamazoo, Mich. Still, many questions remain about how vaccine makers like Pfizer will fulfill the orders of wealthier nations that have procured supplies in advance.",

    "article_text": "Moderna Plans to Begin Testing Its Coronavirus Vaccine in Children The drugmaker Moderna said on Wednesday that it would soon begin testing its coronavirus vaccine in children ages 12 through 17. The study, listed Wednesday on the website clinicaltrials.gov, is to include 3,000 children, with half receiving two shots of vaccine four weeks apart, and half getting placebo shots of salt water. But the posting says the study is \u201cnot yet recruiting,\u201d and Colleen Hussey, a spokeswoman for Moderna, said it was not certain when the testing sites would be listed or start accepting volunteers. A link on the website to test centers is not yet working, and Ms. Hussey said she was not sure when it would become active. Moderna announced on Monday that data from its study in 30,000 adults had found its vaccine to be 94.1 percent effective, and that it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin vaccinating adults. If approval is granted, certain groups of high-risk adults, including people in nursing homes, could receive shots late in December. But no vaccine can be widely given to children until it has been tested in them. Vaccines meant for both adults and children are generally tested first in adults to help make sure they are safe for pediatric trials. Moderna\u2019s vaccine has not yet been studied in children or pregnant women. In the new clinical trial in adolescents, girls past puberty will be tested before each injection to make sure they are not pregnant. \u201cEveryone anticipates that when we test this first in adolescents, then older children, then the real small kids, that the Covid vaccine will work,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser on vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But children have more active immune systems than adults, and may have stronger reactions, including more fever, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue, Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cThey may be more out of sorts than adults for a day or two,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really do want to know, if it\u2019s given in adolescents, what can parents expect? You really want to be able to tell them clearly how you might feel for 24 or 48 hours after you receive the vaccine. And obviously, we really want to be able to tell parents it works.\u201d If a child had intense side effects and parents were not prepared for it, they might be reluctant to go back for the second shot, Dr. Schaffner said. Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that vaccines \u201cfor the most part\u201d work equally well in children and adults. Occasionally, as with the hepatitis B vaccine, different doses are required, he said. Moderna will study the same dose in children that it has tested in adults. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Pfizer began testing its coronavirus vaccine in children as young as 12 in October. A large clinical trial found its vaccine to be 95 percent effective in adults, and the company has requested emergency authorization from the F.D.A. Britain approved the Pfizer vaccine for adults on Wednesday, the first country to do so. AstraZeneca has also tested its vaccine in children, but not in the United States. As vaccine studies have moved forward, rumors have spread on social media, particularly among people who oppose vaccines in general, that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to require vaccination for everyone, including children. His team has denied those claims, and Mr. Biden has said that he will rely on scientists\u2019 advice for the best way to end the pandemic.",

    "article_text": "A Turkish-German Couple May Save Us From the Virus. So Why Is Germany Uneasy? BERLIN \u2014 When the German company BioNTech and Pfizer announced last month that they had very promising results for a vaccine against the coronavirus, my Twitter feed went wild. Alongside the flood of congratulations and expressions of joy, there was cause for special jubilation: Ugur Sahin and \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, the couple who founded and run BioNTech, are Germans of Turkish descent. Their story promised to challenge the resentment against immigrants that over the past decade has become pervasive in German public life. If anything could unseat anti-migrant sentiment, surely a Turkish-German couple saving the world from a deadly virus would do it. Even so, the invention of a vaccine by a couple with Turkish names seemed to come at the right time. Ten years ago, in a book titled \u201cGermany Abolishes Itself,\u201d a formerly high-ranking Social Democrat, Thilo Sarrazin, claimed that the educational gap between immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and Germans was rooted in genetic differences (\u201cintellectual deficits,\u201d he called them). Immigration, Mr. Sarrazin warned, was threatening Germany\u2019s economy by decreasing overall education standards. The book became a best seller and still sits on many middle-class bookshelves. Alternative for Germany, the far-right party formed in 2013 that has exploited and intensified anti-migrant feeling, picked up on the narrative, stigmatizing immigrants as a dangerous drain on the nation\u2019s resources. The party never stops pounding the drum. In 2018, for example, Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the party, called immigrants \u201cKopftuchm\u00e4dchen\u201d and \u201cMesserm\u00e4nner\u201d \u2014 head scarf girls and knife men \u2014 from the floor of Parliament. Political debate, in no small measure because of the party\u2019s success, often focuses on the problems supposedly linked to immigration: religious zealotry, crime, poverty. Against this backdrop, Mr. Sahin\u2019s and Ms. T\u00fcreci\u2019s success felt like a welcome opportunity to celebrate the benefits of immigration, to recognize how migrants enrich and deepen our society. Their stories \u2014 Mr. Sahin, the son of a Turkish laborer, came to Germany as a child while Ms. T\u00fcreci, the daughter of a Turkish doctor who moved from Istanbul, was born in Germany \u2014 brought to light the often hidden history of postwar immigration to Germany. Starting in the 1950s, to fuel its postwar industrial boom, Germany recruited laborers mostly from Italy and Turkey. Called \u201cGastarbeiter\u201d \u2014 \u201cguest workers\u201d \u2014 they were not meant to stay. But many did, and today their children and grandchildren are an integral part of the country\u2019s society. Yet they are often overlooked. Championing in particular the success of Dr. Sahin, the son of a Ford factory worker, felt like a necessary corrective to such condescension. But singling out works both ways: It can offer much-needed recognition, but it can also make immigrant success look like an exception and mark migrants out as \u201cnot one of us,\u201d as a colleague of mine pointed out. When I called a few Germans of Turkish descent, many expressed a similar ambivalence. \u201cFinally, here was something we have missed for a long time: appreciation,\u201d Hatice Aky\u00fcn, a friend and a columnist for the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel (where I work), told me. As a fellow child of \u201cguest workers,\u201d she felt a connection to the couple \u2014 \u201ca biographical pride, if you will.\u201d But she was also uncomfortable with the focus on their biographies. \u201cI\u2019ve played the role of a poster child for successful integration myself for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can be tiring and frustrating to be seen through that lens all the time.\u201d Naika Foroutan, a professor at Humboldt University in Berlin, seemed to share this feeling. \u201cI think it is right and important and gratifying that their descent is stressed,\u201d she wrote in an email. But she, too, has had enough of the focus on role models. \u201cThis type of framing reproduces the idea of exceptionality \u2014 that it\u2019s always an exception when migrants rise in society and achieve something big,\u201d she wrote. Not only does that overlook the essential role migrants play in society generally; it\u2019s also far from the truth: Studies show that migrants tend across time to move up the social strata. But migrants remain underrepresented in the top echelons of society and their opportunities for advancement, generally, are limited. For Cem \u00d6zdemir, a member of the Green Party who in 1994 was the first child of a Turkish \u201cguest worker\u201d to be elected to Germany\u2019s Parliament, that\u2019s what makes it important to highlight stories like those of Dr. Sahin and Dr. T\u00fcreci. \u201cIn Germany, where you come from still plays a major role in determining where you\u2019re going to go,\u201d Mr. \u00d6zdemir told me. So it\u2019s especially important to elevate inspiring examples, as an encouragement for those navigating the difficulties of German society. \u201cI know from my own experiences that with a Turkish name,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will always have to do better, be watched closer.\u201d It\u2019s a sad truth. More than a half century after the parents of Mr. \u00d6zdemir, Ms. Aky\u00fcn and Dr. Sahin came to Germany, the country is ill at ease with its immigration history \u2014 and far from providing everybody with the same chances. That\u2019s why, for now, Dr. Sahin and Dr. T\u00fcreci\u2019s story is essential. It shows that Germany\u2019s successes are inseparable from the migrants who \u2014 in 1960 or 2020 \u2014 come to call the country home.

    "article_text": "U.K. Approves Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine, a First in the West LONDON \u2014 Britain gave emergency authorization on Wednesday to Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine, leaping ahead of the United States to become the first Western country to allow mass inoculations against a disease that has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide. The decision cleared the way for a vaccination campaign with little precedent in modern medicine, encompassing not only ultracold dry ice but also a crusade against anti-vaccine misinformation. Britain\u2019s beating the United States to authorization \u2014 on a vaccine codeveloped by an American company, no less \u2014 intensified pressure on U.S. regulators, who are under fire from the White House for not moving faster to get doses to people. But it also fueled concerns that Britain was acting in haste for political reasons or trying to muscle its way to the front of the line for deliveries. European regulators on Wednesday cast doubt on the rigor of Britain\u2019s review and said that the authorization was limited to specific batches of the vaccine, a claim that Pfizer denied and British officials did not address. Britain\u2019s move provoked a spirited debate among American scientists about whether U.S. regulators, who are known to be unusually meticulous, could afford to hold off any longer on authorizing a vaccine against a virus that is claiming more than 10,000 lives a day worldwide. American regulators have argued that they lag behind \u2014 if only by a matter of days \u2014 because they are virtually alone in reanalyzing thousands of pages of raw data from vaccine trials before approval. Backers of that approach say it is the only way to minimize unintended damage, in lives and in public trust, from vaccines not working. British and European regulators lean more heavily on the companies\u2019 own analyses, auditing their figures occasionally but otherwise grounding their decisions on vaccine makers\u2019 reports. While the more cautious American approach can be valuable, some scientists said the Europeans subject vaccine makers to considerable scrutiny, and it is imperative to move quickly to curb the suffering wrought by the pandemic. \u201cWhen you say it\u2019s OK to wait another week or two, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s OK that many thousands of people are going to die,\u201d said Dr. Walid F. Gellad, who leads the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. No country until Wednesday had authorized a fully tested coronavirus vaccine; Russia and China approved vaccines without waiting for large-scale efficacy tests. The British government, battered by its handling of the pandemic, exulted in the authorization. \u201cHelp is on its way with this vaccine \u2014 and we can now say that with certainty, rather than with all the caveats,\u201d the British health secretary, Matt Hancock, said Wednesday. While the go-ahead bodes well for Britain, which broke from the European Union\u2019s regulatory orbit to approve the vaccine early, it will have no effect on the distribution of the hundreds of millions of doses that the United States and other wealthy countries have procured in prepaid contracts. It also offers little relief to poorer countries that could not afford to buy supplies in advance and may struggle to pay for both the vaccines and the exceptional demands of distributing them.  Roughly 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with BioNTech, a smaller German firm, were being packaged at the company\u2019s Belgian manufacturing plant on Wednesday for shipment to Britain. How and when they will arrive is a secret for security reasons, the company said. The complicated logistics of moving, defrosting and preparing the vaccine meant it was going to be given only at 50 British hospitals to begin with. The vaccine must be transported at South Pole-like temperatures, and in trays of 975 doses. First to be vaccinated will be doctors and nurses in the country\u2019s National Health Service, along with nursing home workers and people 80 and over with previously scheduled doctors\u2019 appointments. A government advisory committee has suggested that older or more vulnerable health workers, and doctors and nurses who work with fragile patients, would be among the first in line. But the government has not said when other employees of the National Health Service would be eligible for vaccines. Essential workers, like teachers, transport workers and first responders, would not be vaccinated until after people 50 and over and those with underlying health problems received shots. The advisory committee plans had made nursing home residents a top priority, but they will have to wait until the government begins distributing vaccines beyond hospitals. Pfizer and BioNTech have suggested that is possible, given that the vaccine can be stored for five days in a normal refrigerator. Eventually, people will get their shots in mass vaccination centers being set up by the military at soccer stadiums and racecourses, or at doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy, and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill,\u201d Prime Mister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd now the scientists have done it.\u201d For Britain, which has suffered one of Europe\u2019s highest per capita death tolls from the virus, the decision by its drug regulator was the latest evidence of a vaccination strategy that has been the most aggressive in the West. Britain remains under the authority of the European Union\u2019s drug regulator until it consummates its split from the bloc on Dec. 31. But the government recently strengthened an old law that allows it to step out from under the bloc\u2019s regulatory umbrella in public health emergencies. That allowed it to fast-track a review of the Pfizer vaccine, which was 95 percent effective in a late-stage clinical trial. Britain had pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine and 315 million doses of competing vaccines, spreading its bets to assure it can inoculate the country\u2019s 67 million people. British ministers cast the speed of the Pfizer approval as an early example of the new flexibility the country will have once it fully untethers itself from European regulation. Yet Brexit has also exacted costs, starving Britain\u2019s drug regulator of money it used to draw from contracts with the European Union.  British regulators are also vetting a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. It is cheaper and easier to store than Pfizer\u2019s, so much of the world could rely on it, but its regulatory path forward in the United States is unclear after scientists and industry analysts questioned promising early results. The chemistry underlying Pfizer\u2019s vaccine had never before produced an approved shot, but scientists have experimented with it for years, testing vaccines that did not make it to market. In order to coax cells to make a viral protein, called a spike, and elicit an immune response, this class of vaccine delivers genetic instructions, known as messenger RNA, encased in tiny fat globules. BioNTech made a prophetic bet on the technology and joined forces with Pfizer, one of the world\u2019s largest drug companies; they ended up delivering stunning results, on a timeline that was unheard-of before this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to decide on emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine shortly after a meeting of an advisory panel on Dec. 10. American officials have said vaccinations could begin within 24 hours after approval. Another American company, Moderna, and the National Institutes of Health have also developed a messenger RNA vaccine that has proved effective in large trials. The F.D.A. will consider their application for emergency authorization shortly after Pfizer\u2019s. The European Medicines Agency, which regulates vaccines across the European Union, is expected to make a decision about the Pfizer vaccine later in December. Pfizer has said it expects to be able to produce up to 50 million doses this year, about half of them going to the United States. Since each person needs two doses, a month apart, up to 25 million people worldwide could begin vaccination before 2021. The United States has bought 100 million doses in advance from Pfizer, and the European Union 200 million doses. The approval arrived at a perilous moment in the pandemic in Britain, where the virus has killed nearly 70,000 people, and hundreds more die each day. A third of England\u2019s hospital systems were caring for more Covid-19 patients in recent weeks than at the height of the first wave in the spring. A monthlong shutdown of restaurants and pubs has stanched the spread of the virus, but that is being replaced by a less stringent system of localized restrictions, with allowances for Christmastime travel that scientists fear will seed another uptick in infections. In a clinical trial, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine proved highly effective among older adults, who are more vulnerable to developing severe Covid-19 and who do not respond strongly to some types of vaccines. It caused no serious side effects.  As vaccines become widely available, the scientific feat of developing them will give way to the social and political problem of convincing people to take them. In Britain, the source of some of the most virulent modern disinformation about vaccines, just over half of people have said in surveys they would definitely accept an inoculation. Safety concerns have been accentuated by the speed of vaccine testing and approval, despite Britain\u2019s regulators saying repeatedly they were not taking shortcuts. Beyond those challenges, manufacturers will quickly need to eventually make billions of doses and move them to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. The Pfizer vaccine makes this effort especially complex. It has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) until shortly before injection, requiring transportation in boxes stuffed with dry ice.

    "article_text": "Long-Term-Care Residents and Health Workers Should Get Vaccine First, C.D.C. Panel Says WASHINGTON \u2014 An independent panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Tuesday to recommend that residents and employees of nursing homes and similar facilities be the first people in the United States to receive coronavirus vaccines, along with health care workers who are especially at risk of being exposed to the virus. The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, voted 13 to 1 during an emergency meeting to make the recommendation. The director of the C.D.C., Dr. Robert R. Redfield, is expected to decide by Wednesday whether to accept it as the agency\u2019s formal guidance to states as they prepare to start giving people the shots as soon as two weeks from now. \u201cWe are acting none too soon,\u201d said Dr. Beth Bell, a panel member and global health expert at the University of Washington, noting that Covid-19 would kill about 120 Americans during the meeting alone. States are not required to follow the panel\u2019s recommendations, but they usually do. The final decision will rest with governors, who are consulting with their top health officials as they complete distribution plans. The new recommendation is the first of several expected from the panel over the coming weeks, as vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna go through the federal approval process, on the thorny question of which Americans should be at the front of the long line to get vaccinated while supply is still scarce. The panel described it as an interim recommendation that could change as more is learned about how well the vaccines work in different age groups and how well the manufacturers keep up with demand. The roughly three million people living in long-term care and those who care for them are a relatively clear target; 39 percent of deaths from the coronavirus have occurred in such facilities, according to an analysis by The New York Times. But states and health systems will ultimately have to decide which of the nation\u2019s 21 million health care workers should qualify to receive the first doses, as there won\u2019t be enough at first for everyone. Pfizer and Moderna have estimated that they will have enough to vaccinate, at most, 22.5 million Americans by year\u2019s end, with the required two doses, a few weeks apart. The C.D.C. will apportion the supply among the states, with the initial allocation proportional to the size of each state\u2019s adult population. The only member of the committee to vote against the recommendation was Dr. Helen Talbot, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, who expressed discomfort with putting long-term-care residents in the first priority group because the vaccines\u2019 safety had not been studied in that particular population. \u201cWe enter this realm of \u2018we hope it works and we hope it\u2019s safe,\u2019 and that concerns me on many levels,\u201d she said before the vote. But most panel members who offered opinions said they thought the high death rate among that group made it imperative to include it. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Romero, the chairman of the panel, said that he felt strongly that its process had adhered to its core principles: \u201cmaximizing benefit and minimizing harm,\u201d promoting justice and addressing health inequities. Dr. Beth Bell, the co-chair, acknowledged that all of the members would have liked more data from clinical trials but said that because of the pandemic emergency, \u201cwe need to act.\u201d The panel, whose 14 voting members have expertise in vaccinology, immunology, virology, public health and other relevant fields, has hinted that the next priority group it will recommend for vaccination \u2014 \u201cPhase 1b\u201d \u2014 will be so-called essential workers, a huge group numbering more than 85 million. A division of the Department of Homeland Security has come up with a list of workers states should consider counting in that group; it includes teachers and others who work in schools, emergency responders, police officers, grocery workers, corrections officers, public transit workers and others whose jobs make it hard or impossible to work from home. After essential workers, the committee is leaning toward recommending vaccination of adults with medical conditions that put them at high risk of coronavirus infection, such as diabetes or obesity, and everyone over 65. But some states might diverge to an extent, possibly choosing, for example, to vaccinate residents over 75 and then some types of essential workers. All other adults would follow the initial groups. The vaccine has not yet been thoroughly studied in children, so people under 18 would not be eligible yet. For at least a month or two, there will not be nearly enough vaccine to cover everyone in the initial groups. Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who leads the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday morning in an interview with The Washington Post that Pfizer and Moderna would be able to provide an additional 60 to 70 million doses in January \u201cif all goes well.\u201d Since each person gets two shots, that would only be enough for 55 million people at most through the end of January \u2014 about 22 percent of the nation\u2019s roughly 255 million adults. Production will continue to increase in February and March, Dr. Slaoui said, with the hope that two new vaccines, from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, will gain F.D.A. approval. \u201cSo very quickly, we start having more than 150 million doses a month in March, April, May,\u201d he added. He and other federal officials have said that the general public is likely to be able to be vaccinated by May or June. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The C.D.C. panel was originally not supposed to vote on its recommendations until after the F.D.A. had approved a vaccine. But it bumped up the timing to give states more guidance as they complete their distribution plans, which must be submitted to the C.D.C. on Friday. On Tuesday, the group specifically suggested that within the long-term-care population, residents of nursing homes, who tend to be the most frail and susceptible to Covid, should get the first vaccines in the event that there aren\u2019t enough, along with staff members who have not had the virus within the last 90 days. Within the much larger category of health care workers, the panel said that health systems should consider prioritizing those who have direct contact with patients and their families and those who handle infectious materials. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who leads the C.D.C.\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the panel that based on her recent conversations with state health officials, most states and large cities \u201cbelieve they can vaccinate all of their health care workers within three weeks.\u201d But whether they reach that goal depends on how much vaccine they get, and how quickly. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky told reporters on Monday that his state had more than 200,000 health care workers but would receive only 38,000 doses in its first shipment and that it might not get another for two weeks. Long-term-care facilities include nursing homes, with about 1.3 million residents; assisted-living facilities, with 800,000 residents; and residential care facilities, which tend to be small and cater to specific populations. The federal government has contracted with CVS and Walgreens to deliver vaccines to most such facilities nationwide, with teams of pharmacists making three visits to each to ensure that every staff member and resident gets both an initial shot and a booster shot several weeks later. Several members of the panel urged that small community doctors\u2019 offices not be left off the initial priority list. \u201cTransmission dynamics suggest providers who care for patients earlier in their course of illness may be at higher risk,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a member of the panel who is in charge of public health in Seattle and King County, Wash. Dr. Grace Lee, a panel member and a pediatrics professor at Stanford, said special attention should be paid to health care workers in lower-paying positions, such as nursing assistants, food workers and janitors, who may fear for their job security if they push to secure a spot toward the front of the vaccination line. \u201cI am very mindful of the equity concerns,\u201d Dr. Lee said.

    "article_text": "The U.S. and Britain race to authorize Covid-19 vaccines. The race to be the first nation to authorize a rigorously tested Covid-19 vaccine is intensifying. British regulators are considering two vaccines for emergency approval: one developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and another by Pfizer and BioNTech. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a vaccine manufacturing facility in Wales on Monday, boasting that \u201cif we\u2019re lucky, if everything goes, right, this could be available just in a few weeks.\u201d \u201cThis could, and I stress could, really be the salvation for humanity, these vaccines,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Across the Atlantic, Mark Meadows, President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, summoned the F.D.A. commissioner, Stephen Hahn, to the White House on Tuesday morning to explain why regulators have not yet approved the emergency use of the vaccine developed by Pfizer, according to people familiar with the situation. One official said Mr. Meadows was concerned that the British government may approve emergency use of a coronavirus vaccine before American regulators act, potentially embarrassing the Trump administration. Mr. Trump and Mr. Meadows have pressured the F.D.A. for months to speed up the development and approval of a vaccine, and allies of Dr. Hahn are worried that he could be fired if he fails to satisfy the White House demands. On Tuesday, the White House said that Mr. Trump will host a \u201cCovid-19 Vaccine Summit\u201d next week, two days before a panel of outside advisers to the F.D.A. meets to decide whether the agency should grant emergency approval to the Pfizer vaccine. Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, will also attend the meeting with private sector executives and governors. The global race to develop a vaccine is poised to shatter records for time to market. Around the world, researchers are testing 57 vaccines in clinical trials, and nearly 100 others are being tested in animals or cells. China and Russia have approved vaccines without waiting for the results of late-stage trials, known as Phase 3, which experts say raises serious risks. Britain and the United States vet vaccine candidates differently: American regulators pore over raw data from vaccine makers to validate their results, while regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe lean more heavily on companies\u2019 own analyses. The European Union is also set to conduct its own review of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. The companies announced on Tuesday that they had submitted their final application to the bloc\u2019s health authorities. Moderna announced on Monday that it had also applied for approval for the European market and in the United States. But creating a vaccine is only the first step in what will be a gargantuan feat of logistics: injecting enough people around the world to stop a pandemic in which more than 63 million people have been infected and 1.4 million have died. The United States, Britain and other rich countries have bought massive quantities of doses, but will still have to figure out how to ship, store and distribute them. The Pfizer vaccine brings particular challenges: It must be stored in an ultracold freezer. That quandary already appeared to be affecting distribution plans in Britain. Nursing-home residents were supposed to be Britain\u2019s top priority under an advisory committee\u2019s plans, but a limit on how many times officials believe the Pfizer vaccine can be moved before it loses effectiveness likely means that National Health Service staff members will receive the shots first. In the United States, states largely devise plans for vaccine distribution, but are likely to follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An advisory committee was meeting on Tuesday to discuss those. Governments and health care organizations must also figure out how to overcome mistrust and concern about the vaccine\u2019s safety. On Monday, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Francesco Rocca, warned that misinformation and distrust could torpedo vaccination campaigns. \u201cTo beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust,\u201d he said.

    "article_text": "Who Will Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First? After months of deliberation and debate, a panel of independent experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Tuesday to recommend that health care workers who are most at risk of contracting Covid-19, along with residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, be the first Americans to receive coronavirus vaccinations.  If the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, approves the recommendation, it will be shared with states, which are preparing to receive their first vaccine shipments as soon as mid-December, if the Food and Drug Administration approves an application for emergency use of a vaccine developed by Pfizer. States don\u2019t have to follow the C.D.C.\u2019s recommendations, but most probably will, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which represents state health agencies. The panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will meet again soon to vote on which groups should be next to receive priority. Here are answers to some common questions about the vaccine and its distribution. The C.D.C. committee recommended that the nation\u2019s 21 million health care workers be eligible before anyone else, along with three million mostly elderly people living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. A staggering 39 percent of deaths from the coronavirus have occurred in long-term care facilities, according to an analysis by The New York Times.  But there won\u2019t be enough doses at first to vaccinate everyone in these groups; Pfizer and Moderna, the two companies closest to gaining approval for their vaccines, have estimated that they will have enough to vaccinate no more than 22.5 million Americans by January. So each state will have to decide which health care workers go first. They may choose to prioritize critical care doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists and other hospital employees, including cleaning staff, who are most likely to be exposed to the coronavirus. Or they may offer the vaccine to older health care workers first, or those working in nursing homes, who are at higher risk of contracting the virus. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said on Monday that most of his state\u2019s initial allocation would go to residents and employees of long-term care facilities, with a smaller amount going to hospital workers. It\u2019s important to remember that everyone who gets a vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna will need a second shot \u2014 three weeks later for Pfizer\u2019s, four weeks for Moderna\u2019s. The C.D.C. committee hinted last week that it would recommend essential workers be next in line. About 87 million Americans work in food and agriculture, manufacturing, law enforcement, education, transportation, corrections, emergency response and other sectors. They are at increased risk of exposure to the virus because their jobs preclude them from working from home. And these workers are disproportionately Black and Hispanic, populations that have been hit especially hard by the virus. Individual states may decide to include in this group employees of industries that have been particularly affected by the virus. Arkansas, for example, has proposed including workers in its large poultry industry, while Colorado wants to include ski industry workers who live in congregate housing. After essential workers, the priority groups likely to be recommended by the C.D.C. committee are adults with medical conditions that put them at high risk of coronavirus infection, and people over 65. But again, some states might diverge to an extent, choosing, for example, to vaccinate residents over 75 before some types of essential workers. All other adults would follow. The vaccine has not yet been thoroughly studied in children, so they would not be eligible yet. Each state has a working group, composed largely of public health officials, that has been planning for months and making decisions about vaccination campaigns. Each state\u2019s top health official and governor will probably sign off on final plans. States don\u2019t need to reach everyone in one priority group before moving on to the next, according to the C.D.C. advisory committee. But more federal guidance is expected on the subject. Federal officials have said they plan to ship the first 6.4 million doses within 24 hours after the F.D.A. authorizes a vaccine, and the number each state receives will be based on a formula that considers its adult population. Pfizer will ship special coolers, each containing at least 1,000 doses, directly to locations determined by each state\u2019s governor. At first, almost all of those sites will probably be hospitals that have confirmed they can store shipments at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, as the Pfizer vaccine requires, or use them quickly. Federal officials have repeatedly suggested that people who are not in the priority groups \u2014 healthy adults under 65 who don\u2019t work in health care or otherwise qualify as essential workers \u2014 should have access to the vaccine by May or June, because there will be enough supply by then. But a lot will have to go right for that to happen. One factor is whether, or when, other vaccines besides Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s are approved. Once the vaccine becomes widely available, most people will be able to get it in doctor\u2019s offices and at pharmacies.  Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: Employers do have the right to compel their workers to be vaccinated. Many hospital systems, for example, require annual flu shots. But employees can seek exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs. In such cases, employers are supposed to provide a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d; with a coronavirus vaccine, a worker might be allowed to wear a mask in the office instead, or to work from home. This depends on a number of factors, including the supply in your area at the time you\u2019re vaccinated and whether certain vaccines are found to be more effective in certain populations, such as older adults. At first, the only choice is likely to be Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, assuming it is approved. Moderna asked the F.D.A. for emergency authorization on Monday; if approved, it would most likely become available within weeks after Pfizer\u2019s. Some participants in both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s trials have said they experienced symptoms including fever, muscle aches, bad headaches and fatigue after receiving the shots, but the side effects generally did not last more than a day. Still, preliminary data suggests that, compared with most flu vaccines, the coronavirus shots have a somewhat higher rate of such reactions, which are almost always normal signs that the body\u2019s immune response is kicking in. At the meeting of the C.D.C. advisory committee last week, some members said it would be important for doctors to warn their patients about possible side effects and assure them of the vaccines\u2019 safety. Each company\u2019s application to the F.D.A. includes two months of follow-up safety data from Phase 3 of clinical trials conducted by universities and other independent bodies. In that phase, tens of thousands of volunteers get a vaccine and wait to see if they become infected, compared with others who receive a placebo. By September, Pfizer\u2019s trial had 44,000 participants; no serious safety concerns have been reported. The F.D.A. will also review the data for each vaccine seeking authorization and share it with its advisory committee, which will meet publicly \u2014 in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, on Dec. 10 \u2014 to ask questions and make a recommendation to the agency. The F.D.A. will then decide whether to approve the vaccine for emergency use. Probably. Although people who have contracted the virus do have immunity, it is too soon to know how long it lasts. So for now, it makes sense for them to get the shot. The question is when. Some members of the C.D.C. advisory committee have suggested Covid survivors should be toward the back of the line. \u201cAt the beginning, when it\u2019s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible,\u201d Dr. Robert Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who serves on the committee, said during a meeting of the panel last week.

    "article_text": "Prisons Are Covid-19 Hotbeds. When Should Inmates Get the Vaccine? They live in crowded conditions, sharing bathrooms and eating facilities where social distancing is impossible. They have high rates of asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Many struggle with mental illness. A disproportionate number are Black and Hispanic, members of minority communities that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. So should prisoners and other detainees be given priority access to one of the new Covid-19 vaccines? With distribution expected to start as early as this month, public health officials are scrambling to develop guidelines for the equitable allocation of limited vaccine supplies. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Tuesday to make initial determinations about who gets the first shots. There is broad consensus that health care workers who treat Covid-19 patients should be first in line. Other high-priority groups include residents and employees of long-term care facilities, essential workers whose jobs keep people fed and society running, and medically vulnerable and older adults \u2014 roughly in that order. Prison inmates are not ranked in the top tiers of the federal criteria, even though some of the largest outbreaks have occurred in the nation\u2019s prisons. More than 2,200 inmates were sickened and 28 people died, for example, after an outbreak in the San Quentin State Prison in California over the summer. Yet the C.D.C. advisory committee has prioritized correctional officers and others who work in jails and prisons for the first phase of immunizations. The federal prison system will set aside its initial allotment for such employees, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. The discrepancy raises a chilling prospect: another prison outbreak that kills scores of inmates after the only preventive was reserved for staff. Officials at the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Now several groups, including the American Medical Association, are calling for coronavirus vaccines to be given to inmates and employees at prisons, jails and detention centers, citing the unique risks to people in confinement \u2014 and the potential for outbreaks to spread from correctional centers, straining community hospitals. \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying that prisoners should be treated any better than anybody else, but they shouldn\u2019t be treated any worse than anybody else who is forced to live in a congregate setting,\u201d said Dr. Eric Toner, co-author of a report on vaccine allocation published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The report lists prisoners as a priority group, Dr. Toner said, though not \u201cat the very tiptop, but at the next tier down.\u201d Some states, in their own distribution plans, already are moving in that direction. North Carolina, for example, plans to give first priority to health care providers, but also includes people at high risk for severe disease and high risk for exposure to the virus.  That list includes people in congregate living settings, such as migrant farm camps, jails and prisons, and homeless shelters, along with other \u201chistorically marginalized\u201d populations. Allocating precious medical resources to people who are serving time may be anathema to much of the public, but it is widely accepted that the nation has an ethical and legal obligation to safeguard the health of incarcerated individuals. There is also a powerful public health argument to be made for prison vaccination: Outbreaks that start in prisons and jails may spread to the surrounding community. \u201cPrisons are incubators of infectious disease,\u201d Dr. Toner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental tenet of public health to try and stop epidemics at their source,\u201d he added. One approach, under consideration by the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice, would be to prioritize vaccination only for prisoners and detainees whose medical conditions or advanced age put them at great risk should they become ill. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a criminal justice recommendation,\u201d said Khalil Cumberbatch, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan group focused on criminal justice policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health recommendation. The virus is not in a vacuum if it\u2019s in a state prison.\u201d The United States holds some 2.3 million individuals in prisons, jails and other detention centers, incarcerating more people per capita than any other nation. That includes nearly 500,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting trials, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. (Some jails have taken steps to reduce overcrowding since the pandemic started.) Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: The figure also includes some 44,000 youngsters who are held in juvenile facilities and an estimated 42,000 in immigration detention centers. People held in confinement are uniquely vulnerable to the virus. Incarcerated individuals are four times more likely to become infected than people in the general population, according to a study by the criminal justice commission. Over all, Covid-19 mortality rates among prisoners are higher than in the general population. So far, at least 200,000 inmates have already been infected with Covid-19, and at least 1,450 inmates and correctional officers have died from the virus, according to a database maintained by The New York Times. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Those numbers most likely underestimate the magnitude of the problem, because reporting requirements are spotty and vary from state to state, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and another co-author of the vaccine allocation report. In Connecticut, doctors tested over 10,000 prisoners in state prisons and jails from March to June and found that 13 percent were infected with the coronavirus, according to research published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Inmates who lived in dormitory housing were at the highest risk. Older inmates and Latino inmates also were more likely than others to be infected. Even before the pandemic, many older inmates had poor health after decades of \u201chard living,\u201d said Dr. Charles Lee, president-elect of the American College of Correctional Physicians. \u201cFrom my experience, their physiological age is generally 20 years greater than their chronologic age \u2014 from drugs, from fights, from being incarcerated and homeless, and not getting health care,\u201d Dr. Lee said. Up to 40 percent of incarcerated adults are Black, Dr. Lee said, a group with higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Many argue that regardless of public health considerations, society has both legal and ethical responsibilities to protect the health of inmates. \u201cThere are truly bad guys in prison, but the vast majority of people in prisons and jails are not what the media makes us think about \u2014 they are not mass murderers,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. \u201cMany people are about to get released soon. Many are in for petty crimes.\u201d \u201cThe ethical obligation is to protect the lives of prisoners, not just see them as sources of disease,\u201d Mr. Caplan added.",

The guidelines, \u201c15 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d were accompanied by a grim chart. Based on a prominent model by London\u2019s Imperial College, the chart illustrated with a sinuous blue line how many Americans might die if nothing were done to protect the public\u2019s health. The line rose sharply as the estimated deaths went up, then drifted slowly down until finally, at the far right end of the graph, the number of new cases reached zero. Our national nightmare would end by October 2020 \u2014 that is, right about now. Along the way, if no action was taken, about 2.2 million Americans would die. Dr. Deborah Birx, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s science advisers, referred to the graph as \u201cthe blue mountain of deaths.\u201d Clearly, the pandemic has not ended. So far some 215,000 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus, and reliable estimates suggest that the number could reach 400,000. Health experts agree that, with stronger leadership, the death toll would have been far lower. Nonetheless, there is a collective accomplishment here worth acknowledging. In the Imperial College report, the authors underscored that their worst-case estimate would almost certainly not be realized, thanks to human nature: \u201cIt is highly likely that there would be significant spontaneous changes in population behavior even in the absence of government-mandated interventions.\u201d That prediction proved true, as millions of Americans agreed, however reluctantly, to accept the sacrifices involved in shutting down parts of the economy, keeping distance from one other and wearing masks. In the day-to-day fights over reopening schools or bars, it is easy to forget that there was a time when the idea of canceling large public gatherings \u2014 the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s March Madness basketball tournament \u2014 did not seem remotely necessary. That there was a time when leading health officials said that only sick people and hospital workers needed to wear masks. Today, and despite the president\u2019s own resistance, masks are widely accepted. Various polls show that the number of Americans who wear them, at least when entering stores, went from near zero in March to about 65 percent in early summer to 85 percent or even 90 percent in October. Seeing the president and many White House staffers stricken by the virus may convince yet more Americans to wear masks. The slow but relentless acceptance of what epidemiologists call \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d has made a huge difference in lives saved. The next step is pharmaceutical interventions. Some are already modestly successful, such as the antiviral drug remdesivir and steroids like dexamethasone. But in the near distance are what Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist, has called \u201cthe cavalry\u201d \u2014 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. They are likely to be far more effective. Since January, when I began covering the pandemic, I have been a consistently gloomy Cassandra, reporting on the catastrophe that experts saw coming: that the virus would go pandemic, that Americans were likely to die in large numbers, the national lockdown would last well beyond Easter and even past summer. No miracle cure was on the horizon; the record for developing a vaccine was four years. Events have moved faster than I thought possible. I have become cautiously optimistic. Experts are saying, with genuine confidence, that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected, possibly by the middle of next year. That is still some time off. Experts warn that this autumn and winter may be grim; indoor dining, in-classroom schooling, contact sports, jet travel and family holiday dinners may all drive up infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Cases are rising in most states, and some hospitals already face being overwhelmed. Even if the cavalry is in sight, it is not here yet. To prevent deaths reaching 400,000, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci has warned, \u201cWe all need to hunker down.\u201d The final death toll from Covid-19 will depend both on how we behave going forward and how quickly innovations arrive. Already the United States is faring much better than it did during the Spanish influenza \u2014 the worst pandemic to hit the country to date, and the one to which this one is often compared. It began in early 1918 and did not completely fade away until 1920, when herd immunity arrived, at the cost of 675,000 lives. The country\u2019s population at the time was 103 million, so that toll is equivalent to 2 million dead today. Pandemics don\u2019t end abruptly; they decelerate gradually, like supertankers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that about 10 percent of the American population has been infected. As that figure grows, and as people begin to get shots after a vaccine is approved, transmission should slow. Every Covid survivor and every vaccine recipient will be a broken link in the chains of transmission. There have been rare cases of people becoming infected twice; this happens even with chickenpox. But scientists assume that almost everyone who recovers from Covid cannot get or transmit the virus, at least for many months. Even by spring, we will not be entirely safe, but we probably will be safer. In the interim, as the pandemic runs its course, the percentage of infected people who die from the virus has been falling. The reasons are many. The average age of each new person infected is almost 30 years lower than it was in March. Fraternity brothers may be reckless, but few older Americans are. Nursing homes have become better at protecting their wards. The death rate per nursing home resident in states that were hit by the virus in late summer is about one-quarter the rate in the northeastern and southern states that were hit first. Simple interventions like pulse oximeters are detecting pneumonia before it becomes life-threatening. Steroids like dexamethasone have lowered the number of deaths among hospitalized patients by about one-third. Rolling patients onto their stomachs and delaying ventilator use also helps. Each lesson learned saves lives. Another good omen: Although in the spring health experts were fearful that a bad winter flu season could send thousands of patients to hospitals, all competing for ventilators and medical attention, the possibility of a \u201ctwindemic\u201d of coronavirus and influenza now seems far less likely. Flu is \u201cseeded\u201d in the United States each year by travelers from the Southern Hemisphere after the winter there ends. But this year their flu season was almost nonexistent \u2014 because they were socially distancing and, in some countries, wearing masks. And in this country, flu shots became available earlier than usual; so many Americans are rushing to get inoculated that spot-shortages are developing. If flu does arrive, those shots and our masks should blunt it. Another intervention that might make a big difference is monoclonal antibodies. Two weeks ago, most Americans had no idea what they were. Now, President Trump is touting them as his \u201cmiracle cure\u201d and, whether or not he is ultimately cured, monoclonals are famous. That attention could speed up their clinical trials, which had been delayed. (Many patients declined to volunteer, preferring to not risk being given a placebo when instead they could receive convalescent plasma, which Mr. Trump was promoting in August.) But experts believe that the antibodies could prove far more effective than plasma. Last year, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, monoclonal antibody cocktails proved 90 percent effective at saving Ebola victims from death. But this approach has limitations. It is believed to work only if administered soon after infection, and monoclonal antibodies are hard to produce and expensive, at least at the moment. If the treatment becomes popular, demand will quickly outstrip supply, forcing health officials to make hard choices. Early testing in animals and humans suggests that a dose a fraction the size of the one Mr. Trump received can protect an uninfected person against the virus. If that finding holds up, the antibodies could be used like a fast-acting vaccine, lasting just a month or so but providing a crucial \u201cbridge\u201d to the arrival of the new vaccines. Such a treatment could protect people at highest risk, such as health workers and nursing home residents. Or, in a \u201cring vaccination\u201d strategy, antibodies could be given to the household contacts of known cases. Ring vaccination was how smallpox was defeated. Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated?\u00a0Let us help: But the number of doses will initially be limited, and choosing to use antibodies for prophylaxis over treatment may be frowned upon by medical ethicists. Sometime in the next three months, health experts say, the F.D.A. is likely to begin granting approval to vaccines now in the works. Despite the chaos in day-to-day politics and the fighting over issues like masks and lockdowns, Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the government\u2019s agreement to subsidize vaccine companies\u2019 clinical trials and manufacturing costs \u2014 appears to have been working with remarkable efficiency. It has put more than $11 billion into seven vaccine candidates, and the F.D.A. has said it will approve any one that is at least 50 percent effective at preventing infection or reducing its severity. Moncef Slaoui, Operation Warp Speed\u2019s chief scientific adviser and a former pharmaceutical executive who has overseen the development of 14 vaccines, has said repeatedly that he expects some of the candidates that he picked to have 75 to 90 percent efficacy and at least two to win approval by early January. By then, Dr. Slaoui has estimated, the factories under contract will have produced enough vaccine for 30 to 40 million people, and then another 80 to 90 million people every month after that. Assuming nothing goes wrong, he said, there will be enough doses for all 330 million Americans to be vaccinated by next June. Bill Gates, who is not part of Operation Warp Speed but works with it to develop vaccines for the world\u2019s poor, has agreed with that timetable. There will inevitably be distribution problems, but the military is standing by to help. The chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed is General Gustave F. Perna, a logistics specialist. Some health officials fear that when a vaccine arrives, many Americans will be reluctant to take it. Indeed, about half of Americans have told pollsters that they feel this way. Nonetheless, I believe that hesitancy may dissipate, if no major safety problems emerge as the first few million Americans are inoculated. The last time the nation faced a moment like this was in the 1950s, when polio vaccine became available. For years, parents had lived in fear of the virus, as they saw children die, living in iron lungs or walking with braces on withered legs. When the Salk vaccine became available in 1955 \u2014 and again in the 1960s when it was replaced by the Sabin vaccine \u2014 Americans lined up in droves to receive it. The demand for polio vaccine survived even the horrifying Cutter Incident of 1955, in which a bad batch of 200,000 Salk doses from Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, Calif. partially paralyzed 260 children and killed 10. I have seen a similar trend as I covered the polio eradication drives in Pakistan and Nigeria. When a disease is actually tearing through a population, vaccine hesitation collapses. Even in the face of persistent rumors that polio vaccines would make their daughters sterile, mothers in Pakistan who had seen other children crippled defied their husbands and imams and sneaked their own children off to be vaccinated. Even in the most resistant areas, such as those controlled by the Pakistani Taliban or Boko Haram, vaccination campaigns attracted parents by setting up \u201chealth camps\u201d that offered a dozen vaccines, polio just one among them. No vaccine is 100 percent safe. \u201cThe most effective one may have the greatest risk if it stimulates the immune system enough to create the risk of autoimmune disease,\u201d said Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, an immunologist and founder of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. \u201cThere will be some risk-benefit calculations to make.\u201d But the alternative to being vaccinated is to risk a nearly 1 in 100 chance of death, as well as unquantifiable but still worrying threats of heart disease, lung damage and even brain damage. Not to mention the prospect of being unable to return to work, having to home-school one\u2019s children for years and not eating in a restaurant, flying on an airplane or watching a movie in a theater without the specter of anxiety. Those are strong motivations to take a chance on a vaccine, especially if one\u2019s friends and relatives have had it and fared well. In September, the actress Jennifer Garner conducted an entertaining interview with Dr. Fauci on her Instagram feed, during which she asked when it would be safe to attend live theater again. \u201cThe end of 2021 or maybe even the middle of 2021,\u201d he replied. By then, he explained later, so many Americans would be vaccinated \u2014 or immune by virtue of having survived an infection \u2014 that it would be safe to sit unmasked in a crowded theater. Until then, masks and caution are our best alternative. If we rigorously protect ourselves and each other, we can starve the virus of new hosts until our national epidemic finally evaporates. Then we must help other countries get vaccines too; until they are protected, we cannot venture beyond our borders as tourists or business travelers, nor can others come here. No country can be forgotten; charitable motives aside, their tourists fill our hotels. We will have competition \u2014 or help, if we take a generous view of a global effort. China claims to already have five vaccines in phase 3 trials, and Russia is already marketing its vaccine abroad, although it has not even conducted a phase 3 trial. Many economists think our national recovery will be rapid, like those that followed the first and second world wars, rather than what followed the financial crashes of 1929 and 2008. China, having beaten the virus, has a growing economy again. Among Americans who have not lost their jobs, personal savings are at record levels. Despite loan defaults in this recession, banks are flush with cash and, if need be, can borrow from their thriving Asian counterparts. When the moment is safe, loans to revive restaurants, hotels and other small businesses should flow. In the interim, as we hunker down, Congress must find ways to ensure that millions of Americans who are out of work do not go hungry or get evicted. And once the pandemic is over, one more mission lies ahead: to make sure this does not happen again. We must search for the viruses in nature that are most likely to infect us, and spend the billions of dollars necessary to create vaccines and designer antibodies against them. So that next time we are ready.",

    "article_text": "How quickly can the US distribute a Covid-19 vaccine? Here are the four biggest logistical challenges. The first shipments of Covid-19 vaccines could be just days away, as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots await regulatory approval. Within 24 hours of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s go-ahead, either of these vaccines could begin shipping throughout the US in weeks, if not days. The vaccines\u2019 successful journey from the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 manufacturers to Americans\u2019 immune systems will require more than just the vaccine itself. The inoculation of more than 300 million people in the United States will require everything from glass vials to syringes to sophisticated cooling systems. But since this summer, there has been fear that the production of these supplies won\u2019t have ramped up enough by the time a viable vaccine is ready for distribution.  These worries aren\u2019t unfounded. The early months of the pandemic saw strained supply chains and a slew of shortages. There was a massive manufacturing effort to boost the number of ventilators, and a logistical gridlock over personal protective equipment like N-95 masks. Testing has been delayed in recent months because there aren\u2019t enough chemical reagents.  Now, the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines brings with it a whole new round of supply chain worries. The groups that represent the links in the supply chain for vaccine production \u2014 drug companies, pharmaceutical supplies manufacturers, government agencies \u2014 have had months to prepare. Their overall attitude seems to be one of cautious confidence. Many of these companies say they\u2019ve produced enough of the materials needed for the beginning of a mass vaccination campaign.  But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll have enough in the future. Some initial projects for vaccine production are already being reduced due to delays in securing enough raw material: Pfizer announced it will ship only half the vaccine supply it planned to distribute this year, though it expects to still make a billion doses available next year. Meanwhile, the hardware components are coming together. Production of freezer systems to distribute vaccines is ramping up, and companies that produce pharmaceutical glass for vials have spent the summer preparing their production lines. The US government has also brought on the medical supply company McKesson to assemble handy vaccination kits filled with materials like syringes and needles.  Suppliers and experts told Recode that while distributing Covid-19 vaccines will take a significant amount of coordination, we shouldn\u2019t expect widespread shortages of any needed materials \u2014 if everything goes as planned. The vaccines from both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two shots given weeks apart, which is certain to make the logistics even more complicated. And underlying the whole effort is a fear of waste and the idea that precious vaccine doses could go bad due to logistical failures.  \u201cThe most important question that countries have to ask themselves is where will this go wrong?\u201d said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo at the International Air Transport Association. \u201cIf it goes wrong, and a vaccine is effectively no longer usable, that\u2019s potentially a life that\u2019s at stake.\u201d Then there\u2019s the question of how willing to take a vaccine Americans will be. A November Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans would get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 50 percent in September. If enough people are willing to get inoculated and health care facilities have enough supplies and coordination to inoculate them, the effective end of the pandemic in the US could be months away, not years.  The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely be the first to receive emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and Moderna is expected to be next. While Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be kept in a regular refrigerator for up to a month, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, a fact that creates some major challenges for distribution. For shipping and short-term storage, Pfizer has built packaging equipped with a cooling system that can keep the vaccine cold for up to 30 days if it\u2019s refilled with dry ice every five days. This system also includes a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of the shipment. The Pfizer vaccine can also be stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers for up to six months.  Companies that supply such freezers have been working hard to meet the surge in demand. While many hospitals already have ultra-cold freezers, they\u2019re typically used for other medical purposes, which means that hospitals need more. \u201cRight now, we are out of everything,\u201d an executive of So-Low Environmental Equipment, one of the makers of these freezers, told CNBC in November.  Alex Esmon of Thermo Fisher Scientific, which also makes ultra-low-temperature freezers, told Recode that the company started preparing for a surge in demand earlier this year and that orders have grown at least two-fold since then. He points out that thousands of doses can be stored in a relatively small freezer, which means that health care facilities can calibrate what cooling supplies they need based on how many people they expect to inoculate in a given time period. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily require a huge build-out,\u201d Esmon explained. \u201cIt requires the right build-out based on what each clinic and hospital system determines is going to be their need.\u201d  And then there\u2019s the need for dry ice, both for Pfizer\u2019s custom vaccine packaging and for other types of freezers that rely on the material. Dry ice companies have expressed some caution about the supply of carbon dioxide that they rely on, as there was a shortage of the compound earlier this year. While some of these providers say they\u2019re fine for now, they don\u2019t know what will happen once a vaccine receives authorization, but they anticipate a surge in demand.  \u201cRight now we have a great supply chain of CO2, which is beautiful for us because we haven\u2019t let down any of our customers in the last six months,\u201d Marc Savenor, the CEO of the company Acme Dry Ice, told Recode. He added that his company is already hearing from transportation and pharmaceutics companies for advance orders.  Still, the unique temperature needs of the Pfizer vaccine necessitates some thinking ahead from facilities that will distribute it. The cooling requirements could make it harder to distribute in rural areas, and even some hospitals don\u2019t yet have enough infrastructure to keep it cold.  Those planning to distribute the Pfizer vaccine have to decide between investing in ultra-low-temperature freezers, or buying lots and lots of dry ice, according to Jessica Daley, a supply chain expert at the health care supplier Premier. And as health care facilities consider the requirements of the first vaccine available, there are likely others down the line that will have different needs.  Anticipation of a vaccine has also boosted demand for pharmaceutical glass to make vials that will hold and protect doses while they\u2019re being transported and stored. Vials are important because they allow for the shipment of multiple shots of a vaccine in the same container. These vials can\u2019t be too big, because once they\u2019re opened, the vaccine inside can spoil quickly. So we need a lot of vials.  Over the summer, there was enough concern about a shortage of vials that the German company Schott, the world\u2019s largest producer of pharmaceutical glass, denied requests from drugmakers to reserve its borosilicate glass in advance. (Borosilicate is a type of glass that can protect the vaccine from contamination \u2014 like tiny glass particles \u2014 and high temperatures.) Schott says it made three out of every four glass vials used in all three stages of vaccine trials, and in preparation for a vaccine, the company aims to produce enough vials for 2 billion vaccinations. The Italian firm Stevanato Group, which also aims to produce enough glass for 2 billion doses, and the German company Gerrescheimer, have also committed to supplying pharmaceutical glass for vaccine containers. US companies are also producing alternatives as protection against bottlenecks. For several years, the New York-based glass manufacturer Corning has been working on a novel type of pharmaceutical glass, but the pandemic has given the novel material new promise. Valor Glass is supposed to be stronger than borosilicate glass, and less likely to produce cracks that can affect the sterility of a vaccine dose. (Corning also produces borosilicate glass tubing as well as Gorilla Glass, which is used for smartphone screens.)  In June, Corning received a $200 million contract from the US government to expand production of Valor Glass. The company now plans to produce an extra 164 million vials annually by the end of 2021, which would be 10 times what it produced before the pandemic, according to Brendan Mosher, the vice president and general manager of Corning\u2019s pharmaceutical glass business.  Another alternative is from SiO2 Materials Science, which makes medical-grade containers out of plastic that have a very thin coating of pure silica, the primary ingredient in most glass. The material can withstand incredibly cold temperatures, is lighter than traditional glass, and is less likely to break, SiO2\u2019s chief business officer Lawrence Ganti told Recode. These high-tech vials are already being used by Moderna and other companies that make Covid-19 treatments. A $143 million contract with the federal government helped SiO2 Materials Science add hundreds more employees, and Ganti says the company will be producing vials for about 200 million doses every month by 2021. When vials full of doses are delivered to and unpackaged at their facilities, health care workers will use needles and syringes to remove the dose from the container and inject the vaccine into patients. Across the US and the world, this will require an incredible number of syringes and needles.  Over the summer, Trump administration trade and manufacturing policy director Peter Navarro warned that it could take up to two years to manufacture enough syringes and needles to distribute a coronavirus vaccine nationwide. In a whistleblower complaint,  vaccine expert Rick Bright also warned that the Strategic National Stockpile only had 15 million syringes and later urged members of Congress to boost the government\u2019s supply. The country, the experts said, would need hundreds of millions of needles. The government has ramped up the production of syringes and needles in the intervening months. The Department of Defense has spent $100 million to secure more syringes and safety needles in a deal meant to provide over 500 million safety syringes within a year to the Strategic National Stockpile. The federal government also loaned nearly $600 million to a Connecticut-based company called ApiJect, which produces pre-filled syringes that serve as an alternative to the standard methods of injection. This particular device hasn\u2019t been used before \u2014 a fact that has prompted some confusion and concern, especially since the device has yet to be approved by the FDA. Meanwhile, health care supplier McKesson has been charged by the federal government with assembling vaccine kits, which include needles and syringes, for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on behalf of the Strategic National Stockpile. The government is also working with Becton, Dickinson, and Company, also known as BD, which is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of syringes and needles. BD aims to supply the government with 286 million syringes by early spring, many of which will be sent to McKesson to be included in the US supply of vaccine kits.  \u201cThis is a wonderful solution for providers because all of those little things that, like you said, you don\u2019t often think about \u2014 the alcohol wipes, the Band-Aids, the syringes, the needles \u2014 those things will be provided in those kits,\u201d Daley, the supply chain expert at Premier, told Recode, adding that they don\u2019t anticipate a shortage of syringes.  Still, BD has also warned buyers not to stockpile or buy more than they need, and that health care providers planning to distribute the Covid-19 vaccine should not order injection devices on their own. But the company\u2019s senior vice president for public affairs, Elizabeth Woody, expressed confidence in the plans, saying that the company felt prepared for the pandemic in part because of its experience with the H1N1 outbreak.  \u201cWe got a flavor of what might be required at a time like this,\u201d Woody told Recode. \u201cSince the start of the Covid pandemic, we\u2019ve been working around the clock, discussing our needs with governments across the globe, and really running our needle and syringe production lines 24/7.\u201d  Taking all of the needed materials into account \u2014 freezers, glass vials, syringes, needles \u2014 there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety around making sure that the vaccine ends up in the right place at the right time. No one wants vaccine doses to go to waste.  While Pfizer will distribute its own vaccine, McKesson will handle the distribution of the vaccine from Moderna once it\u2019s approved. But there are other key players that are preparing for their role in vaccine distribution. Airlines are bracing to start moving the vaccine, even turning to passenger planes that have been grounded by low demand during the pandemic. Shippers like FedEx, UPS, and DHL are all preparing for deliveries, and some are boosting freezer storage while also balancing the demands of holiday season online shopping. Once the vaccine arrives, there\u2019s another hurdle before injection. Depending on their area and resources, local health facilities could vary widely in their ability to get vaccines to patients.  \u201cMy concern is there may not be enough storage capacity or staff to be able to vaccinate at the desired rate,\u201d Northwestern professor Hani Mahmassani told Recode. \u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of little things that can go wrong at that level, and you may not have the health care infrastructure to deliver.\u201d The second dose also presents unique challenges: Vaccine distributors injecting patients with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine need to be meticulous about which patients receive which vaccine, and keep track of who needs a booster shot just a few weeks later. Meditech, one prominent provider of electronic health records in the US, is working on providing a certificate to patients as they receive the first and second dose, for instance. US health officials have also said that people who get vaccinated will receive \u201cvaccine cards,\u201d harking back to the idea of immunity passports discussed earlier this year.  But that means that even if all the supply chains for delivering vaccines and supplies hold up, the greatest challenge will still be logistical: getting the right people to show up and receive the vaccine \u2014 and a necessary booster \u2014 at the right time. For health care facilities, that will mean a high level of coordination and meticulous tracking. There\u2019s understandable fear that that might be a far-fetched goal, too. Nearly a year into the pandemic, Covid-19 testing is still crippled by long lines, delays, and confusion.  Even if the supply chain holds and the distribution of the vaccine goes off without a hitch, the public has to be willing to take the vaccine and get their booster shots in the right time frame. Large numbers of people need to be inoculated for the US population to reach herd immunity. \u201cIf only 40 percent of the population gets vaccinated, this thing will not disappear,\u201d said Hughes, the air cargo expert at IATA. Otherwise, he added, the vaccine is \u201ca bit like a fire break when you have a wildfire.\u201d It might slow the spread, but it won\u2019t save the forest.

The finding squares with the 94.5 percent efficacy rate the company reported two weeks ago, based on its first interim analysis of trial data.  Of the 196 Covid-19 cases in the trial, 185 were in the placebo group and only 11 in the vaccine group, Moderna reported. Even more important, the vaccine \u2014 called mRNA-1273 \u2014 appears to protect against severe disease, not just asymptomatic or mild cases. Of the 30 severe Covid-19 cases among trial participants, all occurred in the placebo group. If the finding is real, it would likely mean averted deaths and hospitalizations when millions of people are immunized.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got 100 percent protection against severe disease,\u201d Paul Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told Vox. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable.\u201d  \u201cIf these numbers are right, it\u2019s more than we\u2019d need for the vaccine to be a major control measure for this outbreak,\u201d said Eric Rubin, an infectious disease specialist and the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.  Moderna\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, said in the press release that the company plans to request an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which would allow the vaccine to be used in limited cases for people facing some of the highest risk of exposure to Covid-19, like health care workers. \u201cWe believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,\u201d he added. Given that the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford coronavirus vaccine research groups have also put out promising findings recently, this latest announcement of final data from the Moderna trial reaffirms that the world will likely have several highly effective vaccines for Covid-19 \u2014 and the end of the pandemic may be on the horizon. High efficacy also means that fewer people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, the threshold at which the virus can no longer spread easily from person to person. But, as always, there are caveats. In this case, the vaccine requires two doses, there are some side effects, and we don\u2019t yet have details about how the vaccine worked in high-risk groups. And while demonstrating efficacy is important, the road to getting millions of people vaccinated will be fraught with logistical challenges. A lot of difficult work on a Covid-19 vaccine still lies ahead. Moderna\u2019s announcement of 94.1 percent efficacy is based on a phase 3 clinical trial. In particular, the results are from the COVE study, conducted in collaboration with the US government\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Phase 3 is where the vaccine is tested against the virus spreading in the real world. Since experimenters can\u2019t deliberately infect people, they have to wait and see who gets sick with Covid-19 in their volunteer pool, comparing the group that received the actual vaccine to the group that received the placebo. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is administered as two doses. To speed up the process, researchers recruit thousands of volunteers so that the rate of accumulating infections goes up. But it only takes a handful of infections to demonstrate that the vaccine works. If a vaccine doesn\u2019t work, and half the people in the trial get the vaccine and the other half get the placebo, we\u2019d expect coronavirus cases to be evenly split in the two groups, Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, told Vox. But when a vaccine is effective, we get results like the ones Moderna is reporting.  According to the biotech firm, experimenters detected 11 cases in people who received two doses of the vaccine compared to 185 in the placebo group. This shows that the virus was spreading among volunteers in the clinical trial but was drastically lower among those who received Moderna\u2019s vaccine. \u201cWhen we think about the level of evidence, this is a strong result,\u201d Dean said.  Moderna\u2019s latest results were announced in a press release, and came directly from the company. While there have been several peer-reviewed interim studies about its vaccine, Monday\u2019s announcement of final results didn\u2019t arrive with any published data \u2014 just like the November 16 announcement of interim results. That doesn\u2019t mean the findings are wrong, but they lack critical details and nuances we need to interpret them \u2014 like how well the vaccine works if people get only one dose (not an unlikely scenario in the real world) and how effective it is in high-risk groups. We don\u2019t know anything on the former, and on the latter, Moderna has only reported that \u201cefficacy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity, and gender demographics.\u201d While the company provided numbers for how many trial participants were over 65 and from various ethnic communities, the company didn\u2019t say how the vaccine performed in each of these subgroups. That information is critical, since these are the people who\u2019ve been hardest hit by the virus. We also don\u2019t yet know how long people who got the vaccine remain protected from the virus, Dean pointed out. There are also the side effects to consider. Moderna has reported no serious safety issues to date and said that most problems tended to be mild to moderate \u2014 but up to 10 percent of participants experienced severe side effects, according to an earlier press release. These included fatigue (9.7 percent), muscle pain (8.9 percent), joint pain (5.2 percent), headache (4.5 percent), other pain (4.1 percent), and redness at the injection site (2 percent). Since the vaccines will ultimately have to be distributed to millions, if not billions, of people, it\u2019s important to pay attention to side effects. Rare complications will be more likely to show up once lots of people get the shot. And clinical trials of other Covid-19 vaccine candidates \u2014 like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine \u2014 have already been paused due to complications among recipients.  If the Moderna vaccine receives emergency approval in the US, distribution could begin in December. Bancel, the Moderna CEO, told Science that the company plans to charge $32 to $37 per dose of the vaccine in developed countries. But while the company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of 2020 for the US market, distributing the vaccine will be challenging.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine requires long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That\u2019s well within the temperature range of conventional refrigerators and warmer than the temperature requirements of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, but it may still pose a logistical hurdle in some lower-resource settings, like rural hospitals, that lack certain kinds of cold storage facilities.  Moderna\u2019s is also a two-dose vaccine, which means every recipient needs to come back for a second injection to get that high rate of efficacy. We know from other multi-dose vaccines that not everybody will return for that second shot \u2014 and the efficacy profile may look different. \u201cWhen you do an experiment, it\u2019s done under best conditions,\u201d Offit said. \u201cWhen things roll out in the real world, in real-world conditions, there\u2019s a fraying.\u201d  It\u2019s also important to remember that an effective vaccine is not enough to end the pandemic quickly. Measures like social distancing, practicing good hygiene, and wearing face masks will remain essential to control the spread of Covid-19 until a vaccine is widely available. Public acceptance may also be an issue, and health officials will have to overcome a rising wave of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine research also doesn\u2019t end once a vaccine is rolled out. Public health officials, doctors, and the biotech companies will still have to track complications across millions of people and pay attention to how quickly immunity wanes.  So far, we have two months of safety data after the second dose, and while that\u2019s not long-term, it should build confidence, Offit said. \u201cSerious side effects usually shot up within six weeks of the second dose. 260,000 people have died this year in the US [of Covid-19]. It would be great if we could do a three- to four-year study and look at length of efficacy and the duration of efficacy. But the question isn\u2019t when do you know everything here \u2014 it\u2019s when do you know enough.\u201d          ",

    "article_text": "The UK is the first country to grant emergency approval to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine  The United Kingdom on Wednesday granted temporary authorization for emergency use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to adults age 16 and older, with the first 800,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine slated to be offered in the country next week.  This makes the UK the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine and the first government approval of a vaccine backed by a clinical trial. (Some countries like Russia and China began administering their Covid-19 vaccines before completing large-scale trials.) It\u2019s also the fastest a vaccine has ever gained approval, albeit on a temporary basis.  \u201cI\u2019m confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onward, things are going to be better,\u201d said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a press conference. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have summer next year that everyone can enjoy.\u201d The UK\u2019s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), granted the temporary authorization shortly after Pfizer and BioNTech reported in November that their Covid-19 vaccine was 95 percent effective. Though this is a temporary authorization, the MHRA is conducting a rolling review of vaccine trial data as it comes in and may grant full approval at a later date. In contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating vaccines based on completed studies, which increases the length of the approval process. The UK government reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech to purchase 40 million doses of the vaccine through 2021 \u2014 enough for 20 million people \u2014 mainly shipped from Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium.  \u201cThis authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,\u201d said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in a statement.  The UK has been one of the most severely afflicted countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 1.6 million reported infections and almost 60,000 deaths in a population of 66 million. The government recently imposed a second national lockdown as cases spiked; restrictions on movement and which businesses can stay open may begin to relax this week as the number of new cases declines. But with winter approaching, the risk of more Covid-19 spread in the UK remains high.  With limited doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to give out for the time being, the UK is establishing several priority tiers for Covid-19 immunization.  The country\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday laid out guidelines for administering the vaccine based mainly on age. The top priority is residents and workers at care homes for older adults, a ranking based on the number of vaccinations that would be needed in each tier to prevent one death, not necessarily risk of exposure.  That\u2019s why health workers, who will be at the front of the line in the US, are not in the top tier in the UK, even though they may be encountering the virus more frequently. \u201cAs the risk of mortality from COVID-19 increases with age, prioritisation is primarily based on age,\u201d according to the guidelines. The committee divided its overall priority list into nine groups. \u201cIt is estimated that taken together, these groups represent around 99% of preventable mortality from COVID-19,\u201d according to the JCVI guidelines.  But the guidelines also note that vaccine deployment strategies may have to shift to address concerns like mitigating health inequalities and logistical challenges. The latter is particularly important for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because it has some of the most stringent cold storage requirements of any Covid-19 vaccine candidate: temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. While Pfizer and BioNTech are developing shipping containers that can maintain these temperatures for 30 days, it\u2019s likely that the first facilities to receive it will be major health facilities that already have freezers.  Recipients will have to receive the vaccine as two doses spaced 21 days apart, so rigorous patient tracking will be needed as well.   Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week voted on US guidelines for vaccine approval. The recommendations from the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices stated that health workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be up first for a Covid-19 vaccine. That health workers are in the top tier stands in contrast to the guidelines issued by the UK.  Establishing these priorities is all the more critical now that a vaccine is poised to begin distribution in the US in weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech have also applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US from the FDA for their Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA is meeting on December 10 to discuss their vaccine. This week, Moderna, another mRNA Covid-19 vaccine developer, also applied for an EUA.  If granted, these emergency approvals would mark the fastest vaccine development timeline ever, an amazing feat against an unprecedented pandemic. But Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise across the US, and it will still be a few more months before there is widespread access to a vaccine.    ",

    "article_text": "Who will get the Covid-19 vaccine first? A CDC advisory panel just weighed in. With two Covid-19 vaccine candidates expected to be approved for the US market in the coming weeks, a group of experts met Tuesday to advise on which Americans should be immunized first. In a 13-1 vote, they put health care personnel and staff and residents of long-term care facilities at the front of the line.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent medical and public health experts, has been meeting for months to think through the question of whom to prioritize during a pandemic while vaccine supplies are still limited.  ACIP is highly influential in the US. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which overwhelmingly accepts the committee\u2019s guidance. States aren\u2019t obliged to follow it, however. It\u2019s up to governors \u2014 and individual hospitals and vaccine sites \u2014 to make their own vaccine prioritization plans.  But with coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths rising exponentially, the meeting was another stark reminder that vaccine rationing will be a painful reality for months while supplies remain short.  \u201cThere is an average of one Covid death per minute right now,\u201d said Dr. Beth Bell of the University of Washington, who chairs ACIP\u2019s Work Groups, at the meeting\u2019s opening. \u201cIn the time it takes us to have this ACIP meeting, 180 people will have died of Covid-19.\u201d  And that\u2019s one reason why, vaccine and public health experts told Vox, ACIP should have weighed in sooner. Major health groups like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have published advice on how countries and other decision-making bodies can set their prioritization plans for Covid-19 vaccines.  \u201cIt would have been helpful to have this a week ago,\u201d said Ruth Faden, the founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, since states, which have been waiting on the guidance, must place their first orders of Covid-19 vaccines with the government and share their initial distribution plans by Friday. \u201cStates were not caught completely unaware here,\u201d Faden added \u2014 since ACIP had signaled in previous meetings the direction they were likely to go \u2014 but Tuesday\u2019s guidance could have been more specific, particularly when it comes to how to immunize America\u2019s health workforce. ACIP\u2019s primary task on Tuesday was to vote for phase 1a of the rollout for two priority groups: health care personnel and long-term care facility staff and residents, comprising about 24 million people.  According to CDC officials, there will only be 5 million to 10 million doses of the vaccines available per week for these groups once vaccines are approved, which should happen before the end of the year. The two manufacturers that are expected to have vaccines approved first, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, will have enough doses to vaccinate only around 20 million people by the end of December.  Long-term care facility residents and staff are a top priority because they have accounted for 40 percent of US Covid-19 deaths, according to the committee. And it makes sense to prioritize health care workers \u2014 they\u2019ve also been among the groups hardest hit by the virus, and we need them healthy and working to keep the health system functioning.  But the gap between the priority groups and the expected supply is a problem ACIP should have addressed, experts say.  It\u2019s not clear from the guidance who among the health workers should go first, said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of public health at Yale School of Public Health. \u201cThis matters because states might have 20,000 or 100,000 doses and figuring out where to use them in a priority group is going to be a hard question.\u201d  ACIP has only said that \u201cindividuals with direct patient contact,\u201d personnel working in residential care and long-term care facilities, and workers without coronavirus infection in the last 90 days should go first.  \u201cDirect patient care is often interpreted as physicians and nurses and clinicians,\u201d said Saad Omer, director at the Yale Institute for Global Health, who is part of both the WHO and NASEM Covid-19 vaccine prioritization committees. \u201cBut you have to go beyond that to explicitly say that includes cleaning workers, others who are doing housekeeping, etc.\u201d  These groups are potentially just as exposed to the coronavirus as ICU doctors or nurses since they\u2019re working in the same high-risk spaces.  \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between say a dermatologist that\u2019s doing cosmetic surgery in a private office and somebody who\u2019s in a Covid-19 ward in a large inner-city hospital,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, added. \u201cIt would be enormously helpful if there could be a greater stratification based upon risk of the health worker.\u201d  What\u2019s more, had ACIP been more specific about which health workers are high risk, \u201cyou leave open a strategy of prioritizing them then going to other high-risk groups rather than [immunizing] the entirety of the health system workforce,\u201d said Faden \u2014 who also advises the WHO on vaccine prioritization. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said most states are planning to be able to immunize their entire health care workforce within three weeks of getting the first Covid-19 vaccine shipments. If that\u2019s true, \u201cissues here regarding sub-prioritization will be very short-lived and the need for more detailed guidance is reduced,\u201d Schwartz said.  ACIP typically sets recommendations for vaccine policy based on specific vaccines, and they\u2019ll reconvene and potentially shift their advice as soon as Covid-19 vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They\u2019ll also need to vote on which groups come after phase 1a of the rollout.  If ACIP follows through with what they\u2019ve been telegraphing so far, the committee will prioritize essential workers (such as teachers, food and agriculture workers, police, and firefighters) in phase 1b, and adults 65 and older and with high-risk medical conditions in phase 1c.  ACIP would deviate from other international expert groups with this plan, Omer said. The WHO and NASEM vaccine frameworks have both prioritized older adults and adults with underlying health conditions alongside or immediately after health workers, instead of essential workers.  \u201cThe reason everyone is prioritizing the elderly \u2014 compared to people 18 to 29 years of age  \u2014 is that even at ages 65 to 74, they have a 90 times higher risk of death,\u201d Omer explained. \u201cMy hope is [ACIP] will revisit some of the assumptions that were driving the considerations for the trade-off between essential workers and older age populations.\u201d  ",

But as he answered questions from reporters on Friday, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t make vaccines and masks mandatory. BIDEN TO CALL DURING INAUGURATION FOR 100 DAYS OF WEARING MASKS And the president-elect, who spoke\u00a0in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., called Friday\u2019s unemployment report \u201cgrim.\u201d He urged Congress and President Trump to immediately pass a COVID-19 relief measure and warned that \u201cthe future will be very bleak\u201d without such a deal. Biden was asked if taking the vaccine should be mandated for Americans. \u201cI don't think it should be mandatory, I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power -- it's like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide,\u201d Biden replied. And he vowed that he\u2019d \u201cdo everything in my power as president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That\u2019s why I said in my inaugural speech I\u2019m going to ask people to commit to 100 days to wear a mask.\u201d WHERE THE CDC SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD WEAR A MASK The president-elect predicted that \u201cif people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will still be a raging crisis, and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they\u2019re going to see deaths drop off the edge. They\u2019re going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick. And my hope is they\u2019ll then be inclined to say \u2018it\u2019s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people.\u2019\u201d Biden emphasized that when it comes to distributing the vaccines across the country, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more that has to be done.\u201d He said that Trump administration officials have \u201cclued us in our their plan on how they plan to distribute the actual vaccine to the various states but there is no detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen anywhere as to how do you get the vaccine out of a container and into an injection syringe into somebody\u2019s arm. And it\u2019s going to be very difficult for that to be done and it\u2019s a very expensive proposition.\u201d Biden noted that he agrees with the priorities \u201claid out so far\u201d by the Trump administration that those who would receive the vaccines first would be \u201cfirst responders and those in nursing homes and in-home care, the first people on the list.\u201d But he added that \u201cthere has to be some equity in how this is distributed\u201d as he stressed that officials have to figure out how to get the vaccine to minority communities hard hit by the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Biden added. And the president-elect touted that \u201cI think that my taking the vaccine and people seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence.\u201d Taking aim at President Trump, Biden argued that \u201cit\u2019s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it\u2019s been so diminished in this administration thus far.\u201d More than 276,000 deaths throughout\u00a0the country have been tied to the coronavirus since the pandemic swept the nation in February and March, with more than 14.2 million COVID-19 cases in total. There has been a surge in cases throughout much of the nation during the past month. NEW JOBS REPORT SUGGESTS CORONAVIRUS SURGE THREATENING ECONOMIC RECOVERY Speaking hours after the Labor Department reported that jobs increased by 245,000 in November, down from 610,000 in October, Biden described the report as \u201cdire\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d  \u00a0\u201cIt shows an economy that\u2019s stalling,\u201d he said. But he said that if the government reacts now, \u201cwe can regain begin to regain momentum.\u201d But Biden warned that \u201cthere\u2019s no time to lose. Millions of people have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed. They\u2019ve lost their health insurance or are in danger of losing their health insurance. One in every six renters is behind in rent. One in four small businesses can\u2019t keep their doors open.\u201d Biden called on Congress and the president \u201cto act and act now\u201d and warned that \u201cif Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits they rely on. Merry Christmas.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the future will be very bleak. Americans need help and they need it now. And they need more to come early next year,\u201d he added. The president-elect said he was encouraged by a proposed $908 billion bipartisan framework in the Senate and said it showed that both parties can work together.  Biden said that coronavirus stimulus checks for. families \u201cmay be still in play.\u201d He added that \u201cI think it would be better if they had the $1,200\" payments to families. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top two Democrats in Congress, have backed the deal heading into talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden twice dodged questions on whether he's talked yet with McConnell, the top Republican on Capitol Hill. Then-Vice President Biden and McConnell had a history of striking deals to avert fiscal catastrophes during the Obama administration. \u201cMcConnell knows me,\u201d Biden noted. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m straight as an arrow.\u201d Biden also characterized the bipartisan proposal as \u201cjust a down payment\u201d and once again promised to push for more coronavirus relief aid when his administration takes over next month. The president-elect was also asked about pressure from Democrats to name a more diverse cabinet and administration. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see significant diversity,\u201d Biden said. And he emphasized that he\u2019ll name the \u201csingle most diverse cabinet\u2026ever.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

The FDA will meet on Dec. 10 to discuss\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. In the meantime, state leaders and health officials\u00a0have begun announcing that initial doses of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0vaccines, namely that of Pfizer,\u00a0are expected in the coming weeks pending the FDA's approval.\u00a0 HOW DO THE MODERNA AND PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINES COMPARE? A team of doctors involved with the clinical trial for Moderna\u2019s vaccine published correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, detailing findings among 34 healthy adult participants. The jab involves a two-dose regimen, administered 28 days apart. At the 100-microgram (\u03bcg) dose, the vaccine \u201cproduced high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies that declined slightly over time, as expected, but they remained elevated in all participants 3 months after the booster [second] vaccination,\u201d the doctors wrote. The levels of antibodies among trial participants also \"exceeded\" that of 41 recovering COVID-19 patients in a control group. Adults aged 18 to 55 saw the highest levels of antibodies, followed by the eldest participants (aged over 71), and finally, those aged 56 to 70. The team reported no serious adverse events, \"and no new adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the vaccine occurred after day 57.\" UK DEFENDS PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DECISION AMID CRITICISM IT MOVED TOO FAST Researchers say it is \u201cnot yet established\u201d whether the antibodies translate to protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the results do imply that the vaccine has the potential to offer \u201cdurable immunity\u201d against disease. \u201cOur findings provide support for the use of a 100-\u03bcg dose of mRNA-1273 in an ongoing phase 3 trial, which has recently shown a 94.5% efficacy rate in an interim analysis,\u201d researchers concluded.

LIVE UPDATES: TODAY'S LATEST COVID-19 HEADLINES The CDC director also \u201clooks forward\u201d to further recommendations, hinged on vaccine availability, that the U.S. should prioritize older adults over 70 living in multi-generation households. These households oftentimes pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to \u201cHispanic, Black and Tribal Nations families\u201d caring for the elderly,\u00a0the statement continues. \u201cThis framework, in addition to the\u00a0[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] ACIP guidance, will ensure a more equitable distribution to those most at risk for hospitalizations and fatalities,\u201d reads the statement. The panel\u2019s vote on Tuesday evening was 13-1. CDC'S NEW CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE GUIDANCE\u00a0'STRIKES BALANCE' WITH RESISTANT PUBLIC, EXPERTS SAY Aside from Redfield\u2019s nod of approval, the plan to distribute the vaccine to health care workers and long-term care residents is also dependent on authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which still has to approve an application of emergency use from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, the first to apply, and biotech company Moderna. Both companies have developed coronavirus vaccine candidates that have proven over 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials.\u00a0 \"If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes or approves a COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will quickly hold a public meeting to review all available data about that vaccine,\" reads the CDC's webpage, updated Thursday. \"From these data, ACIP will then vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and, if so, who should receive it.\" Fox News\u2019 Madeline Farber contributed to this report.",

Following FDA approval, the first Americans could receive the jab as early as this month. There are roughly 21 million health care workers and some 3 million long-term care facility residents in the U.S., according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the CDC's\u00a0independent vaccine advisory committee.\u00a0 \"To date, more than 240,000 healthcare workers have contracted COVID-19\u00a0and 858 have died. According to estimates, deaths in long-term care facilities account for 40 percent of all COVID-19 deaths nationwide.\u00a0These factors contributed to the committee\u2019s recommendation to prevent spread by protecting those on the front lines, healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients, and protect the most vulnerable, those elderly persons living in long-term care facilities,\" the CDC told Fox News in an emailed\u00a0statement following the vote.\u00a0 WHEN WILL MODERNA'S CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BE READY TO SHIP? \"The committee intends to meet again following [the FDA] authorization or approval for vaccine-specific recommendations,\" the statement added.\u00a0 States are not required to follow the\u00a0CDC's recommendations; the recommendations simply provide a framework. However, most states are expected to follow the recommendations, one expert said. Moderna, the latest\u00a0contender to\u00a0announce the filing of\u00a0emergency use authorization\u00a0(EUA)\u00a0for its\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0vaccine, said on Monday that it expects to have 20 million doses of its vaccine available in the U.S. by the end of the year, adding that it \"remains on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021.\" CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Pfizer, meanwhile,\u00a0has previously said it expects to produce up to 50 million doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The FDA is scheduled to meet on Dec. 10 regarding Pfizer\u2019s application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its coronavirus vaccine, three weeks after the company filed for it. The FDA plans to meet on Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna's EUA. Critics have questioned the delay in scheduling, including Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary, who said the agency is being \u201ctoo bureaucratic.\u201d \u201cThe FDA has been too bureaucratic, taking too much time,\u201d Makary said Monday, while appearing on \u201cBill Hemmer Reports.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re scheduling around vacation times and tee times of the reviewers, but they should turn the application around in 24 hours.\u201d DR.

On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the CDC Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. He said the first batch of vaccines, produced by Pfizer, could be approved for use in the United States before Christmas. \u201cWe actually believe that from the moment we receive FDA approval, which we think is likely sometime in the week of December 14, we could be shipping within the first 24 hours,\u201d the vice president stated. \u201cAnd we could be vaccinating people within 24 hours of that.\u201d He added that within 48 hours, vaccinations would likely be available to all 50 states and territories across the country. The FDA is expected to approve Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine on December 10. Recent trials suggested the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective. Pending regulatory approval, the vaccines will be transported in giant dry-ice filled containers at a temperature of 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important for these containers is you have the capability to get them plugged in when they\u2019re not actually in transit,\u201d Roger Samways, American Airlines\u2019 Vice President of Cargo, stated. \u201cWe\u2019ve got capability here to plug in 50 containers at any one time.\u201d Pfizer is expected to have 6.4 million doses of vaccine ready by mid-December. In Michigan, Henry Ford Health System noted that they are fully prepared to deploy the coronavirus vaccine as soon as it\u2019s approved for use, which will bring relief to healthcare workers around the nation. \u201cAt Henry Ford Health System, we have been preparing to get the vaccines and have been watching the guidelines very closely,\u201d Dr. Adnan Munkarah stated. \u201cWe have prepared from an operational perspective to make sure that we are able to store the vaccines.\u201d Dr. Munkarah also added that Henry Ford Health System installed freezers that are capable to freeze both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Vaccine priority will be given to frontline healthcare workers and nursing homes. Amid each of these developments, Vice President Pence is optimistic moving forward. \u201cThis time of year is always filled with hope through faith, traditions and in the hearts of the American people,\u201d Pence stated. \u201cBut to be just a week and a half away from what will be the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine is inspiring the people of this country.\u201d \u00a0",
